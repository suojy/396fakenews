MATH SHOWS Trump Would Have Beaten Obama In Romney-Obama Election Â» 100percentfedUp.com,"Email For Republican politicians like Ohio Governor John Kasich who refused to get behind Donald J. Trumpâ€¦it turns out Trump was rightâ€¦he didnâ€™t need you. In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the â€˜never Trumpersâ€?from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten himâ€?
Itâ€™s easy to glance at Tuesdayâ€™s popular vote â€?which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 â€?and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obamaâ€™s 2012 totals in several Midwestern states â€?Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin â€?Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. Whatâ€™s more, she far surpassed Obamaâ€™s 2012 vote total in Florida, the countryâ€™s biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. 
A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the countryâ€™s most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nationâ€™s most critical battleground states. Letâ€™s look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals arenâ€™t yet final because not all precincts have reported.

(AP Photo / Dennis System) 
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) â€?Following the results of Tuesday nightâ€™s election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19 th . Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. 
â€œPeople all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,â€?Obama told reporters. â€œMany have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.â€?
Under the Presidentâ€™s order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesdayâ€™s election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. 
Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the presidentâ€™s decision. 
â€œCrooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didnâ€™t allow that to happen. President Obama doesnâ€™t care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.â€?
The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. 
â€œWe have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.â€?
Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. 
â€œMost people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes , but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19 th . What the people are actually voting for are their statesâ€?electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.â€?
Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the Presidentâ€™s Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. 
â€œ[The electoral college] is a fâ€”king joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise . Everyone should have an equal vote, and thatâ€™s just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. Itâ€™s time to bring our system into the 21 st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.â€?
Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. 
â€œWeâ€™re going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,â€?Obama said. â€œWhy did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasnâ€™t this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?â€?Obama said. â€œIf all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.â€?

""THE CASE OF THE VANISHING VISA FILES  
December 25, 2009 10:00:00 PM PST  
By Chuck Goudie   
December 16, 2009 (CHICAGO) -- Potentially important evidence has disappeared in a terrorism case involving two Chicago men. Their visa records vanished from Chicago's Indian consulate. It comes one week after the ABC 7 I-Team raised questions about how David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Rana obtained their foreign visas in the first place. 

The case of the vanishing visa records has churned up diplomats from Mumbai to Michigan Avenue. India's foreign secretary Nirupama Rao told reporters overseas Wednesday that she wants answers from Chicago's Indian consulate about the records and visa documents that have disappeared, records that might show how two accused Chicago terrorists obtained permission to scout targets in India. 

Top officials of Chicago's India consulate wouldn't talk to the I-Team on camera last week when asked how terror suspects David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Rana obtained five-year, unlimited passage visas to India. 

And the consul general did not return calls Wednesday regarding the paperwork they used to process Headley and Rana's visas, which Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao announced Wednesday have disappeared. 

Wednesday evening, the Chicago consul general emailed a statement to the I-Team that conflicted with government statements made in India. The brief statement read: ""We have not reported loss of any papers regarding issuance of visa to David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Rana Hussain. Relevant information concerning the issuance of visa to these persons is available with the Government of India"". 

India's counterpart to the FBI is looking into the visa application process as part of its probe into the 2008 Mumbai massacre. 

The two Chicago suspects are accused of having roles in the assault. Rana was denied bond by a Chicago district judge Tuesday, despite family members and friends offering $1 million in cash and property. Rana has not been directly charged with the Mumbai attack that left 175 dead, but was linked to the assault in government court filings. 

Headley, a Pakistan-born Chicagoan, is a convicted heroin dealer whose birth name was Daood Giliani. He changed his name to ease travel to India, according to federal prosecutors in Chicago and to avoid the required pre-visa background check by Indian authorities. 

Since the time Headley and Rani were processed, India's Chicago consulate office began contracting out visa requests to a private company called Travisa Outsourcing that on its website claims, ""We have revolutionized the way people get their visas."" 

And the new visa processing was subject of a news conference last year. 

""The advantages of outsourcing is the Travisa company, which is handling the outsourcing, has set up a call center,"" said Ashok Kumar Attri, consul general. 

Foreign Secretary Rao said she is impressed with the cooperation the US has given to Indian investigators. Headley and Rana are not due back in court until January."" 

""Was Bernardine Dohrn the Mentor of Michelle Obama at Sidley Austin?

Michelle Obama's senior year thesis at Princeton University, obtained exclusively from the campaign by Politico , shows a document written by a young woman grappling with a society in which a black Princeton alumnus might only be allowed to remain ""on the periphery."" Read the full thesis here: Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 , Part 4 . Michelle Obama thesis was on racial divide â€?Jeffrey Ressner â€?Politico.com 

Sidley Austin likely recognized this in Michelle even if she didn't show them her Princeton thesis. Who better at Sidley Austin to be mentor to the author of this Princeton thesis than Bernardine Dohrn who had been number 2 on the FBI most wanted list? 

Barack Obama was assigned to Michelle Obama in summer 1989. This may have reflected how few blacks there were at Sidley Austin, especially from Harvard Law School or the equivalent. Dohrn got her J.D. from University of Chicago Law School. Since she is a prof at Northwestern despite her background, we might infer she was very smart and understanding. So she was the perfect person to be the mentor for Michelle Obama at Sidley Austin.

Hillary Clinton's e-mail server company got almost $1 million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe Hillary Clinton's name from her e-mails. 

Platte River Networks (PRN) got a $493,000 loan from the Small Business Administration in August 2014 and another $350,000 loan in September 2015:

The first half-million dollar loan arrived not one month after PRN employee Paul Combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at Hillary's request in July 2014 . 

The second $350,000 loan came about one year later.

CBC News Posted: Aug 24, 1999 11:26 AM ET Last Updated: Aug 24, 1999 11:26 AM ET  
Police have wrapped up several days of searching the offices of Starnet Communications in Vancouver. They entered the company offices and homes of some directors on Friday. 

Police were looking for evidence of illegal gambling, distributing child pornography, and money laundering. Since the raid, Starnet officials say police just don't understand their business. 

The search warrant details 18 months of police investigation. It traces a network of companies registered in American and Caribbean jurisdictions. 

The warrant also identifies Vancouver as the centre of Starnet's operations, even though this is a grey under Canadian law. 

Police note that Starnet's revenues grew dramatically in the past two years, from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software. The investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for Friday's raid and seizure of company materials. 

RCMP Constable Peter Thiessen says investigators left Starnet offices yesterday morning. He says, ""They spent the better part of three days going through the business. And as a result of that search the investigation is continuing, but no charges have been laid."" Starnet's many investors were spooked by the raid. Share prices dropped almost 70-percent on Friday. However, the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation. Stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading. 

In written statements, company CEO Mark Dohlen said the Wall Street Journal calls Starnet the leader in Internet gaming and entertainment. He says companies like his, those on the cutting edge, are often misunderstood. Yesterday, Starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business. It plans to focus more resources on gaming. 

The Police investigation is expected to last for several more months.""

""July 7, 2016 Developments in PKI occurred in the early 1970s at the British intelligence agency GCHQ , where James Ellis , Clifford Cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution.[ 19 ] However, as developments at GCHQ are highly classified, the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mid-1990s. 

The public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in 1976 by Diffie, Hellman , Rivest, Shamir , and Adleman changed secure communications entirely. With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting. 

Assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used. With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread, the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute. Commercial reasons alone (e.g., e-commerce, online access to proprietary databases from web browsers) were sufficient. Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol ('https' in Web URLs); it included key establishment, server authentication (prior to v3, one-way only), and so on. A PKI structure was thus created for Web users/sites wishing secure communications. 

Vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market, started companies (or new projects at existing companies), and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability. An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations (see ABA digital signature guidelines), and shortly thereafter, several U.S. states (Utah being the first in 1995) and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations. Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others. 

The enacted laws and regulations differed, there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation, and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be. 

By the first few years of the 21st century, the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly. Operating procedures (manual or automatic) were not easy to correctly design (nor even if so designed, to execute perfectly, which the engineering required). The standards that existed were insufficient. 

PKI vendors have found a market, but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid-1990s, and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated.[20] PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to, and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others. PKI has had the most success in government implementations; the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program.""

Trump fans may have won the election, but they arenâ€™t taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of Michelle Obama. The Donaldâ€™s Deplorables were out in force after the First Lady posed for the cover of Vogue. 
â€œI could have spent eight years doing anything , and at some level, it would have been fine,â€?Obama told the magazine . â€œI could have focused on flowers. I could have focused on decor. I could have focused on entertainment. Because any first lady, rightfully, gets to define her role. Thereâ€™s no legislative authority; youâ€™re not elected. And thatâ€™s a wonderful gift of freedom.â€?
In exercising her freedom, Michelle Obama has done quite a bit to push education, healthy eating, and support for our veterans â€?and in exercising their freedom, the Right has responded with nothing but hate. The reaction to the First Lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical. Readers of Yahoo News showered Obama with racist remarks, calling her an â€œapeâ€?and a â€œmonkeyâ€?and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes. 
If you thought this behavior would stop after the election, you were wrong. Trump fans are not done by a long shot â€?and now they have been emboldened by America electing its first official KKK candidate. 
It will get worse before it gets better.

Washington, D.C. (The Adobo Chronicles) â€?It is common knowledge that Ronald Reagan loved mac nâ€™cheese. Bill Clinton, before his heart bypass, indulged in jalapeÃ±o cheeseburgers. How about Barack Obama? 
In an exclusive interview with White House executive chef Cristeta Comerford, she indicated that Obama does not have one particular favorite food. â€œBut he loves Filipino cuisine,â€?she said. 
Comerford, a Filipino American, has so far served as executive chef under three U.S. Presidents â€?George W. Bush, Clinton and Obama. She is the first woman and the first of Asian descent who has served as White House executive chef. Halo-Halo 
â€œThere are so many Filipino foods that the president likes, but on top of his list is halo-halo, the Filipino version of the Hawaiian shaved ice,â€?Comerford said. Asked to name the top ten Filipino foods fancied by Obama, Comerford gave us the following list: 
1. Halo-Halo (shaved ice) 
2. Dinuguan (pork blood stew) 
3. Balut (duck embryo) 
5. Kinilaw na Kambing (ceviche-style goat meat) 
6. Tocino (sweet cured pork) 
7. Laing (spicy taro leaves) 
8. Pinakbet (Filipino version of ratatouille) 
9. Crispy Pata (Deep-fried pork knuckles) 
10. Kare-Kare (Tripe and vegetables in peanut sauce)

The Daily Beast reported: 
Obama Fires Back at Trumpâ€™s Mean Tweets on â€˜Jimmy Kimmel Liveâ€?
For the second time in two years, Obama read some â€œmean tweetsâ€?about himself on Jimmy Kimmel Live, including one that called him â€œthe Nickelback of presidentsâ€?and another that compared him to Sharknado: â€œLoud, stupid and over-hyped!â€?
But the inevitable kicker came when Obama read one from Donald Trump. â€œPresident Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!â€?Trump once wrote of the president. â€œReally? Well, @realDonaldTrump, at least I will go down as a president,â€?Obama replied.

President Barack Obama has stood behind Hillary Clinton through every step of the FBI investigation into her use of a private email server as his Secretary of State. He has turned a blind eye to her many crimes and has encouraged investigators to let her off the hook. 
Just when Americans thought he couldnâ€™t get any more corrupt, video footage has surfaced of Obama calling on illegal immigrants to vote today.

Dean James AMERICAâ€™S FREEDOM FIGHTERS â€?
Last week, the Pentagon issued a Defense Department directive that allows â€œDepartment of Defense (D0D) personnel to carry firearms and employ deadly force while performing official duties.â€?
The Defense Department has been working on changing the â€œgun-freeâ€?zones on domestic military basis for several years in light of the deadly shootings at military sites in recent years. 
Military.com reports that the directive â€œalso provides detailed guidance to the services for permitting soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guard personnel to carry privately owned firearms on DoD property.â€?It authorizes â€œcommanders, 05 and aboveâ€¦[to] grant permission to DoD personnel requesting to carry a privately owned firearm (concealed or open carry) on DoD property for a personal protection purpose not related to performance of an official duty or status.â€?
The directive also makes clear that DoD will consider further changes to grant â€œ[standard] authorizations for other DoD personnel, who are trained in the scaled use of force or who have been previously qualified to use a government-issued firearm, to carry a firearm in the performance of official duties on DoD property.â€?This would allow DoD with certain combat training to carry firearms without going through the additional step of making application with a commander. 
Kim Smith at Conservative Tribune notes that the policy was a response to an NRA-backed provision in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act that required the Defense Department to allow more service members to carry firearms on base. 
â€œIt is a good first step in that it recognizes personal protection is a valid issue for service members, but there are many roadblocks in the way of making that option available,â€?NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told the Washington Free Beacon . 
Those wishing to apply for permission to carry a firearm must be at least 21 years old and meet all federal, state and local laws, the directive said. 
It would appear that the Pentagon saw no problems with implementing a policy for which President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support. 
President-elect Donald Trump ran on removing gun-free zones from military bases. On July 9, 2015, Breitbart News reported that Trump pledged to end the gun-free scenarios for U.S. troops by â€œ[mandating] that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases.â€?
The immediate institution of this directive probably left President Barack Obama incensed, but he undoubtedly realized that there was nothing he could do to prevent its implementation in a couple of months anyway. And thatâ€™s good news because it works to ensure the safety of our troops, which should always be a priority.

The final reason why whites will vote for Mr. Obama is that the Republicans do not have the backbone to attack him in the only way that would work. If they were serious, they would fill the airways with Jeremiah Wright prancing and raving, along with the message: â€œThis is the man who married Mr. and Mrs. Obama, baptized their children, and whom Mr. Obama calls a â€˜family memberâ€?â€?They would buy radio ads quoting Michelle Obamaâ€™s thesis in which she says she will always be black first and American second. Mr. McCain has nothing like the stomach for a campaign like this. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many blacks probably think he has the stomach for considerably worse: 57 percent think Mr. Obama is in greater physical danger than any white politician, and many say they would have warned him not to run, for fear he would be killed. An assassination would certainly be a shattering event. There is no telling how many cities would go up in flames, and Third-World countries, which have followed the Obama nomination with unprecedented interest, would help make it the most widely reported killing in history. (I have just returned from a Muslim country in which everyone has heard of Mr. Obama and likes him, but most have never heard of John McCain.) Whatever gruesome fantasies blacks may be spinning, however, assassination has gone out of style in America, and white resistanceâ€”such as it isâ€”is dependably nonviolent. Mr. Obama will be perfectly safe. ,,,,,,,,,,,

TRUTH REVOLT 
Thereâ€™s a lot of accusations going around that the 2016 election is rigged. From Democrats suggesting Russia is tampering with the presidential election to a plethora of documents and undercover video that proves Democrats are trying their darnedest to sway the outcome. 
President Obama has laughed off the notion that Bernie Sanders was forced out by the DNC and believes Donald Trump is out of his mind for suggesting elections are rigged. And of course, Obama would never admit that Hillary Clinton could do something wrong. But candidate Obama, in 2008, sure was concerned that the election might be rigged against him. 
Video of him answering a campaign question has surfaced to put to rest the notion that he doesnâ€™t believe in the possibility: 
â€œWell, I tell you what: it helps in Ohio that weâ€™ve got Democrats in charge of the machines. [Cheering] But look, I come from Chicago, so I want to be honest, itâ€™s not as if itâ€™s just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past, sometimes Democrats have too.

WikiLeaks just released their newest batch of leaked emails, and they contain messages sent to and from Barack Obama prior to his presidential inauguration.
The most interesting of the emails in this batch involves a message from John Podesta to Obama regarding an invitation from President George W. Bush to then â€˜President-Electâ€? It alluded to a transition plan that was being worked on before the election took place.
According to the memo, Obama was already discussing his transition into office with the then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. Here is a statement taken from a memo sent from the transition board to Barack Obama:
As you have observed in your interactions with Secretary Paulson, he is apparently eager to involve you and your transition team extensively in his policy choices following the election.
Immediately after the election Secretary Paulson and other members of the Administration will likely seek to involve you and your transition team in their ongoing policy responses to the financial and housing crises. We also expect relentless interest from the press and public about your intended level of engagement with the Administration on these matters during the transition.
Think about this for a second, Obamaâ€™s transition was already being discussed with certain members of the Bush administration. Also, judging by the email, itâ€™s clear that it was known that Obama was going to be the president.

Thanks to Wikileaks, we now have the smoking gun email irrefutably proving not only did President Barack Obama know about Hillary Clintonâ€™s non-government-issued email account, he used it in correspondence with her.
Even more damning to the presidentâ€™s credibility, it appears the lie was a purposeful attempt to protect Clintonâ€™s upcoming bid for the presidency.
Shortly after the New York Times broke the story on March 2, 2015, of Clintonâ€™s use of a personal server to supplant the government system â€?and, as has been revealed, to thwart transparency â€?Obama announced publicly his lack of prior knowledge.
â€œThe same time everybody else learned it through news reports,â€?the president told CBS News White House correspondent Bill Plante, as Zero Hedge reported . â€œThe policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the BlackBerry I carry around, all those records are available and archived.
â€œIâ€™m glad that Hillaryâ€™s instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed.â€?It wouldnâ€™t be a stretch to imagine, however, Obamaâ€™s placid public appearance guarded secret internal panic â€?a panic echoed behind the scenes at the burgeoning Clinton campaign.
An email penned by Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin to Director of Communications, Jennifer Palmieri, and a few others, calling immediate attention to a tweet by journalist Katherine Miller paints an entirely different picture.
Miller tweeted a snippet of the aforementioned interview in which Plante asked Obama, â€œMr. President, When did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the U.S. Government for official business while she was Secretary of State?â€?â€œThe same time everybody else learned it,â€?he responded, â€œthrough news reports.â€?I have some questions here pic.twitter.com/ufkeoZCx2m",english,2016-10-28T01:11:03.164+03:00,anonhq.com,US,12993,BREAKING: Irrefutable Proof Obama Lied to Protect Hillary Clintonâ€™s Run for the White House Read,0,http://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-25-at-1.49.01-PM-660x330.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

President Obama contemplated arming the already controversial â€˜moderateâ€?Syrian rebels weapons to â€œdefend themselves against Russian aircraft and artilleryâ€?as his Plan B for Syria when all else failed in the effort to oust Assad â€?but although this treacherous plan has been effectively shelved, it remains an option for whomever next ascends to the White House.
According to a new report from the Washington Post , Obamaâ€™s Plan B has neither been â€œapproved or rejectedâ€?in the U.S.â€?disintegrating and increasingly complex campaign to depose Syrian President Bashar al Assad â€?which has, of course, precipitated a perilous proxy war with staunch Syrian ally, Russia.
Skepticism over allowing the CIA to provide various anti-Assad terrorists â€?euphemistically termed moderate rebels by the U.S. â€?with â€œtruck-mounted antiaircraft weapons that could help rebel units but would be difficult for a terrorist group to conceal and use against civilian aircraftâ€?apparently forced the plan to be tabled, the Post reports.
In the U.S. program to topple Assad, the CIA has armed and trained defectors from Syrian military known as the Free Syrian Army â€?whose own defectors went on to form the Islamic State â€?as well as other terroristic groups virtually indistinguishable from one another except for their political ideologies.
These issues factored into restrictions on weapons the U.S. would provide to their sponsored rebels; but, as the Post explains:
â€œRebels chafed at the restriction, complaining that it left them vulnerable to air attack by Assad and, more recently, Russia.â€?Plan B was envisaged as a compromise by the CIA.
But the complex state of affairs in Syria has led not only the FSA, but other â€˜moderates,â€?to â€˜radicalizeâ€?â€?complicating U.S.â€?goals and frustrating Russian efforts to purge the embattled nation of terrorists. While the Pentagonâ€™s public goal has duly sought to wrest control from Assad and fight the Islamic State, the CIA program of arming rebels is widely considered counterproductive â€?if not, perhaps, nefarious.
Plan B, despite potentially devastating repercussions, retains stolid support from top officials, including unsurprisingly CIA Director John Brennan and Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter â€?but has lost favor recently with former proponents, including Secretary of State John Kerry.
Kerry and other skeptics rightly grasp providing heavy artillery to rebels fighting Russia-backed Syrian government forces to down Russian aircraft â€?which would undoubtedly turn the smoldering U.S. proxy battle into an all-out war with Russia.
Additionally, the Post reports, a growing number of U.S. officials feel the contentious CIA program has only proven to bedevil the ultimate goal of regime change, and, as one unnamed â€˜senior officialâ€?noted, CIA units are â€œnot doing any better on the battlefield, theyâ€™re up against a more formidable adversary, and theyâ€™re increasingly dominated by extremists,â€?adding, â€œWhat has this program become, and how will history record this effort?â€?,english,2016-10-29T01:54:15.244+03:00,anonhq.com,US,12993,â€˜Plan-Bâ€?â€?Obama Paves Way to Give Syrian â€˜Moderate Rebelsâ€?Anti-Aircraft Weapons to Fight Russia,0.59,http://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/obama-rebels.jpg,0,1,856,0,856,bs,Negative

How did the ""growing trust"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his ""working and personal relationship with President Obama "" change into todayâ€™s deep distrust and saber-rattling? 
Their relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the ""feverish"" state of international relations and lamented: ""My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results."" He complained about ""people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice"" and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a ""common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises."" 
A month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, ""My good friend John Kerry â€?is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerryâ€™s] assurances that the US commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief."" 
Do not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire â€?not to mention statements at the time by the most senior US generals â€?were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia. 
Relations between the US and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft â€?including any stealth aircraft â€?over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft. 
It seems possible that the US air force will challenge that claim in due course â€?perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, ""I wouldnâ€™t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft â€?if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground."" 
Injecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russiaâ€™s warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a US or coalition aircraft. 
Meanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the US is contributing ""a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team"" as a ""major sign of the US commitment to strengthening deterrence here."" 
""This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,"" he explained, referring to NATOâ€™s July summit meeting in the Polish capital. ""The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany."" 
On Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the ""myth"" of a ""Russian military threat,"" calling this a ""profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets â€?expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders."" 
Myth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russiaâ€™s borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against ""saber-rattling,"" adding that, ""We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation."" 
Speaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two and a half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup dâ€™Ã©tat in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russiaâ€™s reaction in annexing Crimea. Americans malnourished on the diet served up by ""mainstream"" media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev, during which ""Yats"" (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washingtonâ€™s choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev. 
This unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, ""really the most blatant coup in history."" 
Itâ€™s time for Western politicians and media to learn their lesson and pay attention to the statements coming out of Russia. Ask yourselves: Why all this hype now? 
Ray McGovern, like Sam Adams, began a career as a CIA analyst under President Kennedy; working on Vietnam, they became close associates. Sam was too straight-arrow to go to the media about the unconscionable fraud regarding the number of Communist forces. Ray knew that and rationalized not doing so himself. So, while a close associate of Sam Adams years ago, Ray fell short of the standard set by the above awardees, who deserved to be honored by Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence.

As the end of Obamaâ€™s term in office approaches, it may be of interest to evaluate his performance on Latin America. One of Obamaâ€™s foreign policy promises at the beginning of his first term was to change the way America does business with Latin America. 
The promise to change the way America does business in its backyard was a significant one because the way America has played in its backyard has a long and consistently appalling history. The history of interference and regime change began early when President McKinley betrayed Cuba and stole it under the deceptive promise of liberating it from Spain. In 1903, Theodore Roosevelt severed Panama from Columbia, declared it an independent nation and put in power a government whose first act was to sign over the future Panama Canal. In a little discussed maneuver, the U.S. cooperated with the 1908 removal of Venezuelan President Juan Vicente GÃ³mez. In 1909, President Taft removed Nicaraguaâ€™s JosÃ© Santos Zelaya because he insisted that US companies in Nicaragua honor their agreements and tried to make his country less dependent on the US by borrowing from European, and not American, banks. 
In the modern era, 1954 saw Eisenhower order the CIA overthrow of Guatemalaâ€™s Jacobo Arbenz. In 1959-1960, Eisenhower would also start the covert action to remove Fidel Castro from Cuba. Kennedy would continue to rain ""the terrors of the earth"" on Cuba. He would also begin the Brazilian coup that would overthrow Goulart in 1964 and undertake a political action to encourage the removal of Cheddi Jagan from power in Guyana. In 1971, Nixon would brutalize Chile with the coup against Salvador Allende. President Omar Torrijos of Panama would die in a plane crash in 1981. In The New Confessions of an Economic Hit Man and in an interview with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now , John Perkins has claimed that Torrijosâ€?plane crash was another US assassination. Though it has never been proven that Torrijosâ€?death was a CIA assassination, there is some evidence that, at least earlier, consideration of his assassination was on the table. At the close of 1989, George H.W. Bush, in an unprovoked attack on the civilian population of a nation that had never threatened America, would take out Panamaâ€™s Manuel Noriega. At the end of the last century and the beginning of this one, Jean-Bertrand Aristide was twice removed from power over the popular voice of Haitians. The Latin American coups would continue through George W. Bushâ€™s unpopular and short lived 2002 removal of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. 
So, it is not unimportant to evaluate Obamaâ€™s performance on his promise to change this tragic and shameful history. Itâ€™s not unimportant, but it is unimpressive. 
It didnâ€™t take long for the first indication that nothing had changed. On June 28, 2009, Hondurasâ€?democratically elected President, Manuel Zelaya, was seized at gunpoint, removed in a coup and whisked away in a plane that refueled at a US military base. 
After the coup, US support to the Honduran military only increased. The American ambassador was never recalled, and the US refused to join the call of the United Nationâ€™s General Assembly and the Organization of American States for the return of the elected President. Though the Organization of American States (OAS) refused to recognize the new coup president, the US State Department refused to join in that too. In fact, following an election that the OAS, the U.N. and others refused to recognize, the US would insist on recognizing the coup government as the victor of the election. 
But, despite the refusal to call Zelayaâ€™s removal at gunpoint a coup, and despite recognizing the coup government as the legitimate government of Honduras, the Obama White House knew it was a coup. By July 24, 2009, less than a month after the coup, the White House was in receipt of a cable sent from the US embassy in Honduras. In an almost comic lack of subtlety that was clearly never meant to be public, the cable is called ""Open and Shut: the Case of the Honduran Coup"". In it, the embassy says ""There is no doubt that the military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup . . . ."" Their conclusions could not be clearer: the embassy explicitly calls it a ""coup"" and says that ""[t]here is no doubt"". And just in case there were any remaining objections, the cable adds that "". . . none of the . . . arguments [of the coup defenders] has any substantive validity under the Honduran constitution"". 
At best, Obama cooperated with the coup by maintaining silence, though his administration was engaged in dialogue with the rebellious military up to the day of the coup, and by recognizing the coup government as the legitimate government of Honduras. Latin American expert Mark Weisbrot told me in a correspondence that ""the Obama administration acknowledged that they were talking to the [Honduran] military right up to the day of the coup, allegedly to convince them not to do it"". But, he added, ""I find it hard to believe that they couldnâ€™t convince them not to do it if they really wanted to: the Honduran military is pretty dependent on the US"" The charge was reiterated by Rodolfo Pastor Fasquelle , the minister of culture in the Zelaya government, who said on Democracy Now that ""I know for a fact that CIA operatives and military personnel of the United States were in direct contact with the conspirators of the coup dâ€™Ã©tat and aided the conspirators of the coup dâ€™Ã©tat."" At worst, Obama was, as Zelaya has always insisted, involved in the coup. Zelaya claims that ""the coup came from the north form the US"" In the heat of the coup, the plane that was carrying the kidnapped president landed at the US military base of Palmerola for fifteen to twenty minutes while it refueled, despite the close proximity of its destination. After the coup, then Secretary of State Clinton has admitted that she aided the coup government by shoring up the coup government blocking the return of the elected government: ""In the subsequent days [after the coup] I spoke with my counterparts around the hemisphere, including Secretary [Patricia] Espinosa in Mexico. We strategized on a plan to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot."" 
After the coup against Zelaya, Ecuadorâ€™s popularly elected president, Rafael Correa, said, ""We have intelligence reports that say that after Zelaya, Iâ€™m next."" He may have been right. 
The year after the Honduran coup, there was an attempted coup on Correa. Although the action failed, Latin American expert Mark Weisbrot says it was clearly an attempted coup to overthrow the government of Rafael Correa. 
Corrrea had renegotiated oil contracts and demanded a bigger share of the big oil companiesâ€?revenue for the people of Ecuador. He also opposed a free trade agreement with the US and closed the US military base in Ecuador. He joined Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia and Ecuador in the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) and successfully defaulted on over $3 billion of foreign debt that was illegitimately contacted by Ecuadorian leaders Correa said were CIA supported dictators. 
Prior to Obama, the US had started action against Correa. An October 2005 embassy cable sent by US ambassador Linda Jewell outlined action for ""desirable political and economic change in Ecuador."" In 2006, she cabled that a Correa election would ""derail"" US hopes as the embassy expects Correa to join Chavez and other nationalist South American leaders."" In the same cable [06QUITO2150], Jewell said that the US has ""actively discouraged potential alliances"" with Correa. She admitted [06QUITO2991] to ""working in concert with other Ecuadorians and groups who share our vision."" 
During the Obama years, the US would continue to intervene in Ecuador. In March 2009, Ecuador expelled Mark Sullivan, an American official whom they accused of being the CIA station chief in Quito and whom they accused of playing a role in the suspension of US assistance to a special investigative police unit when Ecuador named a new chief of whom the US didnâ€™t approve. 
On October 30, 2010, the coup Correa had been expecting came. The coup leader was a graduate of the School of the Americas. A government appointed commission found that ""foreign actors"" had been involved in the coup. One of members of the commission announced his belief that the US State Department and the CIA had been involved. 
The same year, Obama failed his next test. That year, America bankrolled the Haitian elections. The cost was 14 million dollars: a price tag that presumably gave America some say. But Haitiâ€™s Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) banned fourteen parties from running in the election. The CEP was handpicked by the ruling party in a process that is not recognized by Haitiâ€™s constitution. 
Fanmi Lavalas, the party of Jean Bertrand Aristide, who was twice removed in US sponsored coups, is the largest and the most popular party in Haiti. It has won every election it has been allowed to participate in. That it has been allowed to participate in, that is. But in this US backed election, Fanmi Lavalas was not allowed to participate: it was banned by the CEP. 
The US and its allies continued to influence the Haitian elections when they supported a runoff between two unpopular candidates representing essentially the same side. But the second round runoff between the two candidates was illegal because the CEP never accomplished the number of votes to ratify the first round results that selected them. 
The Obama administration financed the election that specifically excluded the party the people wanted to elect. And, in doing so, Obama broke his foreign policy promise to Latin America and very quietly continued to do business with Latin America in the same interventionist way the US had always done business with Latin America. 
The next indicator of a failing grade came in Paraguay, where in June 2012, Fernando Lugo, the democratically elected leader of Paraguay was removed in a coup. The right wing opposition opportunistically capitalized on a skirmish over disputed land that left at least eleven people dead to unfairly blame the deaths on President Lugo. It then impeached him after giving him only twenty-four hours to prepare his defense and only two hours to deliver it. The Latin American organizations Unasur and Mercosur suspended the new Paraguayan government; the US spent coup day negotiating a new military base in Paraguay. As in Honduras, they never used the word â€œcoupâ€? 
But they could have used the word if they hadnâ€™t wanted to support the coup with their silence. As early as 2009, US embassy cables say that Lugoâ€™s political opposition has as its goal to ""Capitalize on any Lugo missteps"" and to ""impeach Lugo and assure their own political supremacy"". The cable notes that to achieve their goal, they are willing to ""legally"" impeach Lugo ""even if on spurious grounds"". Obama knew it was a coup: the US had been tipped off about the strategy and told what it would look like. 
The next year, 2013, the interference moved to Venezuela. Against the wishes of the United States, Hugo Chavezâ€?successor, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, won the right to continue the Bolivarian Revolution by winning the next national election. America was the only country in the world to refuse to recognize the election results , though 150 electoral monitors from around the world monitored Venezuelaâ€™s election, including delegations from the Union of South American Nations and the Carter Center. 
Two years later, in 2015, the Obama administration again became involved in Venezuela. Contrary to Obamaâ€™s promise, business went on as usual with American money being pumped into Venezuela to fund groups who oppose Maduro. Since 2000, $90 million has poured into Venezuela. That sort of interference in Venezuela is not suggestive of a new way of doing business in Latin America. In 2015, that US funded opposition once again attempted to pull off a coup in Venezuela. Maduro explicitly accused the Americans of, as in 2002, being involved. 
The accusation is not an empty one. Venezuelan officials have produced a significant volume of evidence that the events constitute a failed coup and that the US was involved. They have produced a recording of a communique that was to be issued after the Maduro government was removed from power. They have shown confessions by military officials. And they have admitted as evidence a recorded phone conversation between opposition leaders discussing the coup. The day before the planned coup, Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, who is known to have made phone calls to a US number, Leopoldo Lopez and Maria Corina Machado, both major opposition leader of last yearâ€™s attempt to remove Maduro from power â€?an attempt that they made clear was an attempted coup by saying that they would not to stop until they â€?got rid of Maduro "" â€?signed a National Transition Agreement. Weapons were also found in the office of the opposition party. 
Lucas Koerner of Venezuelanalysis.com adds that the aircraft to be used as part of the failed coup has links to the notorious American security firm Academi (formerly Blackwater). And it has been reported that a number of the coup leaders obtained US visas from the American embassy to facilitate escape should the coup fail. 
And, just this past May, President Maduro has declared a state of emergency, accusing the US of once again conspiring with right wing groups in Venezuela to overthrow his government. Maduro says that â€œWashington is activating measures at the request of Venezuelaâ€™s fascist right.â€?
In perhaps his final chance to make good on his promise to do business with Latin America differently, Obama has, once again, disappointed by maintaining American silence on the coup in Brazil. How do we know that Obama should have spoken out against the take over of parliament by an unelected party? How do we know that it was a coup? Because the unelected party said so. Twice: both before the coup and after. 
The publication of a transcript of the call between Romero JucÃ¡, who was a senator at the time of the call and is currently the planning minister in Michael Temerâ€™s new government, and former oil executive Sergio Machado, provides incontrovertible proof that the removal of the elected President was a coup. The phone call lays bare â€œa national pactâ€?to remove Dilma and install Temer as President. JucÃ¡ reveals that, not only opposition politicians, but also the military and the Supreme Court are conspirators in the coup. Regarding the militaryâ€™s role, JucÃ¡ says, â€œI am talking to the generals, the military commanders. They are fine with this, they said they will guarantee it.â€?And, as for the Supreme Court, Glenn Greenwald reports that JucÃ¡ admits that he â€œspoke with and secured the involvement of numerous justices on Brazilâ€™s Supreme Court.â€?JucÃ¡ further boasted that â€œthere are only a small numberâ€?of Supreme Court justices that he had not spoken to. 
So confident is Michel Temer that he has US support for his coup that he is comfortable to openly boast about it in the US in front of an audience of business and foreign policy leaders. Temer clearly told his American audience that elected President Dilma Rousseff was not removed from power for ""violating fiscal laws by using loans from public banks to cover budget shortfalls, which artificially enhanced the budget surplus"" as the official charge stated. She was, the new, unelected President admitted, removed because of her refusal to implement a right wing economic plan that was inconsistent with the economic platform Brazilians elected her on. Temerâ€™s economic plan featured cuts to health, education and welfare spending as well as increased emphasis on privatization and deregulation. 
Rousseff was not on board. So she was thrown overboard. In the words of Temerâ€™s comfortable confession : 
And many months ago, while I was still vice president, we released a document named â€˜A Bridge to the Futureâ€?because we knew it would be impossible for the government to continue on that course. We suggested that the government should adopt the theses presented in that document called â€˜A Bridge to the Future.â€?But, as that did not work out, the plan wasnâ€™t adopted and a process was established which culminated with me being installed as president of the republic. 
Confession. Cased closed. 
And just to remove any doubt that the coup governmentâ€™s motivation was not indignation at Rouseffâ€™s fiscal maneuver, one of the coup governmentâ€™s first acts of legislation was to explicitly legalize the very budgetary act they had impeached Rousseff for two days earlier. 
So, once again, at best, Obama gets a low grade on his foreign policy promise for maintaining silence on what he knows to be a coup in Latin America. Silence is support. At worst, he gets a failing grade for cooperating with the coup. 
American participation in the Brazilian coup has not been established. But, â€œthere is no doubt that the biggest players in this coup attempt â€?people like former presidential candidates JosÃ© Serra and AÃ©cio Neves â€?are US government allies,"" according to Latin American exert Mark Weisbrot. And Boaventura de Sousa Santos, Professor of Sociology at the University of Coimbra in Portugal and Distinguished Legal Scholar at the University of Wisconsin-Madison says that Brazil is awash in financing from American sources, including â€œCIA-related organizations.â€?
The very day after the impeachment vote, Senator Aloysio Nunes of the coup government began a three day visit to Washington . Nunes is a significant player in the coup government: he was the vice-presidential candidate on the 2014 ticket that lost to President Rousseff and a key player in the effort to impeach President Rousseff in the senate. Nunes scheduled meetings with, amongst others, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker and Ben Cardin, as well as with Undersecretary of State and former Ambassador to Brazil Thomas Shannon. Though Nunes denies it, there are reports that his trip to Washington was ordered by Michel Temer. The willingness to go ahead with the planned meetings with Nunes right after the impeachment vote demonstrates, once again, at least tacit acceptance or approval on the part of Washington. 
So, Obama broke his promise. His foreign policy in Latin America may be more silent and more subtle, but the way he has done business with Latin America has not broken from the long line of Presidents who preceded him. At a rapid and consistent rate of almost one each year, Obama has done business as usual in Americaâ€™s backyard: 2009 in Honduras; 2010 in Haiti and, perhaps, Ecuador; 2012 in Paraguay; 2013 in Venezuela; 2015 in Venezuela again and 2016 in Brazil.
