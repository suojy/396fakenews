    "text": "Go to Article \nPolitical activist and Hillary supporter Amal Clooney traveled to Texas to warn Americans about our elected President Donald J. Trump and his tough immigration policies. Maybe she didn't get the memo＃Trump's tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of GOP primary contenders. It wasn't too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence, ※There will never be a President Trump§. \nPerhaps Amal should've traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation. Aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of American ranchers, and threatened the safety and security of American citizens living in homes in or near the US -Mexican border towns＃ \nAmal Clooney has warned that many of president-elect Trump's proposals would be ＆violations of international law.' \nSpeaking at the Texas Conference For Women at the Austin Convention Center on Tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of George Clooney, said she had concerns about America's reputation under the real estate mogul's plans. \nShe noted that Trump's comments during his campaign, ＆that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the U.S. or the fact that there should be state-sponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed 〞 all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that.' \nThe 38-year-old wife said America's reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. \n＆I think there's some concern from abroad as to, ※Are these things actually going to happen?§, or is the U.S. going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally,' according to the Hollywood Reporter. \nPerhaps its time to put our nation's security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us＃ \nBoth Amal and her Hollywood actor husband George, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, have spoken out against Trump in the past. \nEarlier this year, Amal Clooney called for Trump to be challenged on his extreme views. \nWatch George Clooney here whine about press giving Trump too much favorable press: \n＆When you listen to what the leading candidate on the Republican side has been saying about building walls, about excluding Mexicans and a complete shutdown of all Muslims entering in, and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying, ＆They only want jihad. They don't believe in our way of life. They don't respect our system,§ Clooney said. Via: Daily Mail",

    "title": "The Amish In America Commit Their Vote To Donald Trump; Mathematically Guaranteeing Him A Presidential Victory - ABC News",
    "text": "18 SHARE The Amish in America have committed their vote to Donald Trump guaranteeing him the Presidency. (AP Photo / Dennis System) \nCOLUMBUS, OH (AP) 〞 History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November. \nThe organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee. \nThe Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they don't vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process. \n※Over the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,§ said AAB chairman Menno Simons. ※We have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage. Now, they want to put a woman in the nation's highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 Timothy 2:12. We need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lord's way.§ \nAccording to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote. \n※The Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,§ Silver noted. ※They also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.§ \nThe Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision. \n※I don't believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,§ Clinton wrote to the AAB. ※As a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.§ \nMost pundits believe that Mrs. Clinton's plea is too little too late. \nDuring a press conference in Manhattan, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because ※the Amish do great work for a very low price.§ \nThough Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff over the next two weeks. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses. \n※It looked like she was going to win this election easily,§ said Paul Horner, a campaign worker in Ohio, ※But this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Cleary, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. It's really sad to see the campaign end this way.§ \nIf you are interested in learning more about the Amish community and the AAB, you can contact the Pennsylvania Amish Heritage Museum at (785) 273-0325.

Children tend to hear what their parents opinions are on the subject without all the filters. They subconsciously 'vote' the way their parents will vote (supposedly).",

    "title": "California Secessionists to Meet at Capitol Day After Presidential Election",
    "text": "By Joseph Jankowski \nAn organization which has the aim to separate the state of California from the Union of the United States is set to hold a meeting at the state capitol in Sacramento on Wednesday, November 9, 2016, the day after the presidential election. \nThe Yes California Independence Campaign , which is based in San Diego, describes itself as a ※nonviolent campaign to establish the country of California using any and all legal and constitutional means to do so.§ \nThe group is currently trying to qualify a citizen's initiative in 2018 to get a referendum for secession on the ballot in 2019, reports SF Gate . They will be in Sacramento in hopes to gather support for the state's exit, or the ※Calexit,§ as they call it. \n※In our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children,§ reads Yes California 's official website. \nThe group's page reads on: \nAlthough charity is part of our culture, when you consider that California's infrastructure is falling apart, our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country, we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities, poverty rates remain high, income inequality continues to expand, and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today, now is not the time for charity. However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to self-determination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law.\nIt is about California taking its place in the world, standing as an equal among nations. We believe in two fundamental truths: (1) California exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world, and (2) California could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a U.S. state. \nYes California 's website lays out 9 different points covering topics the group believes will benefit from a California exit from the US, including education, peace and security, debt and taxes and immigration. \nOne blog post on their page draws parallels with a ※Calexit§ and the recent referendum known as ※Brexit§ that passed in the UK in June which showed that most British people are ready for their country to leave the EU. \nThe push for secession is nothing new to California. In 1941 the mayor of Port Orford, Oregon, Gilbert Gable, proposed the idea to push the Oregon counties of Curry, Josephine, Jackson, and Klamath to join with the California counties of Del Norte, Siskiyou, and Modoc to form a new state, later named Jefferson. \nModoc County of Northern California voted in 2013 to join neighboring Siskiyou County in a push to secede from the State of California . \nIn 2014, two counties in northern California petitioned for the right to form a 51st State of America, which they also wanted to name Jefferson. \nJoseph Jankowski is a contributor for Planet Free Will.com .

( The Adobo Chronicles, Washington Bureau)  White House executive chef, Filipino-American Cristeta Comerford, has revealed what she would cook for President Hillary Clinton's first meal when she moves (back) to the presidential residence. That is, of course, assuming the Clintons will continue to retain her services. \nIt would be pancit, that signature noodle dish closely identified with the Philippines. \nWhen asked by The Adobo Chronicles why she chose pancit, Comerford said that pancit represents long life and a ＆long term,' meaning she was hoping Hillary would be elected to a second four-year term like her predecessor and current boss, President Barack Obama.

Trump's White House (s) will be headquartered in the Trump hotels in Doral and Las Vegas. \n※This will bring the White House 〞 and the president 〞 closer to the people,§ Trump declared. He also indicated that he will not be using Airforce One or Marine One. Rather, he said he will be using his own private jet at no cost to the taxpayers. \nThe Adobo Chronicles asked Trump what will happen to the media and the White House press corps when he travels across the country or abroad. \n※Well, they just have to book their own commercial flights and follow me around,§ he said. \nThousands of miles away in the Philippines, a leading presidential candidate said that if elected president, he will not live in Malaca?ang 〞 the Filipino counterpart of the White House 〞 because he likes to sleep in his own bed. His bed is in Davao City of which he is currently the mayor. \nRodrigo Duterte said he will commute daily from Manila to Davao using a private jet of his friend. Davao is about a hour and forty-five minutes by plane from Manila, which is a far way shorter commute than being stuck in daily traffic on Metro Manila's streets.",

    "text": "10 Shares\n4 5 0 1\n\"USA! USA! USA!\" they chanted together in the Hilton Ballroom as the results came in. Who needs polls? They never gave him a chance but now we have it: President Donald Trump. Not only were the polls spectacularly wrong (who will ever trust this particularly bankrupt form of moralising presumptive analysis and telling us how we do and should feel?) but also the pundits who were not just arrogant about the fact that Trump had no chance but also were hopelessly out of touch with what America was thinking across its societal spectrum, what it wanted, what was felt deep in its blood.\nIt is a rejection of the liberal consensus the entire West has wallowed in since the 90's and a rejection of Obama and the false hope he decried, the impotent nature of US political leverage around the world and the rejection of brazen corruption and questionable ethics as typified by \"Crooked Hillary\".\nThe world must live with it; democracy has spoken and they're going to have to get over the words President Trump. Some will head for the hills, some will run to Canada, others will continue to cry but as Obama said yesterday, regardless of the result \"tomorrow the sun will still shine.\"\nThis is a cry for American exceptionalism and like him or not Trump typifies that. He is committed to education, and demands high performance. Selling well is an admirable skill for a President to have. Negotiating with Congress, internationally, etc., is exceptionally useful. Trump has taken beatings financially and come out smelling like a rose.\nTrump's business experience involves negotiations with business leaders and even governments around the world, and he likely has connections behind the scenes that surpass those of simply purely political candidates -- this gives him keen, realistic insights into economics in different parts of the world, as well as additional avenues to pursue trade agreements, and even perhaps some nuanced insights of particular financial weaknesses of possible global competitors, not to mention experience and insight into the partnerships and/or antagonism between different industries and particular governments.\nMORE... Trump's sexual predator characteristics - His Grandfather was a pimp, but at least he paid the women he hired The significance of the GOP's attempted purge of Donald Trump Trump, Turkey, and police tyranny: The crisis of Imperialism finds political expression An America in denial This vote comes down to the reckoning that for too long, politicians have sold the American people out to foreign nations and global industry. What Donald Trump is doing is representing the absolute heartbreak and anger and frustration at a government gone mad and it seems the Left completely underestimated that in their vitriol in crying #NeverTrump and portraying him as the devil incarnate.\nAlthough it is entirely true that Trump is ostentatious and has his mistakes, he brings something to the Presidential table no other candidate had before; he speaks his mind.\nAmerica clearly is sick of weasel politicians who are too afraid to say what people want to hear, they want the facts straight.\nPresident Trump isn't cut from the political class, that class which is entrenched in its self-interest and has let the country down time and time again. Ross Perot once said that we need somebody to clean out the stables, a corrupted, ethically questionable President is therefore not the answer in order to accomplish that and I'm not talking about Donald Trump.\nTrump is a pragmatist in an era of rapidly approaching chaos, he is not a social engineer, a think tanker who wants to please those lining his bank accounts. The liberal Democratic policies of Obama, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Sen. Harry Reid and their company created a climate that has led to this decision today.\nSo what if his language is intemperate and insulting? Even lacking in nobility from time to time? How can a true changemaker be straitjacketed by politically correct chains if he or she must express the will of the people, uncomfortable concerns that lie dormant for far too long?\nObama won because conservative voters stayed home. He had promise and he let so many down, what did Clinton have? And that is why conservative voters had to get out and vote.\nTrump prefers isolationism on a world scale, Clinton voted to take us to war in Iraq and to overthrow Libya's Gaddafi, all in the guise of being \"muscular.\"\nPerhaps today's landmark and historic decision is not so much about Trump's strengths and power but more about the crippled weakness of the country in 2016 and you simply cannot blame him for that.",

    "text": "U.S. militia girds for trouble as presidential election nears 11/02/2016 \nREUTERS \nDown a Georgia country road, camouflaged members of the Three Percent Security Force have mobilized for rifle practice, hand-to-hand combat training 〞 and an impromptu campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \n※How many people are voting for Trump? Ooh-rah!§ asks Chris Hill, a paralegal who goes by the code name ※Bloodagent.§ \n※Ooh-rah!§ shout a dozen militia members in response, as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend. \nAs the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton. \nThey say they won't fire the first shot, but they're not planning to leave their guns at home, either. \nTrump's populist campaign has energized militia members like Hill, who admire the Republican mogul's promise to deport illegal immigrants, stop Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexico border. Trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be ※rigged,§ and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win. At least one paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud. \nArmed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early 1990s, fueled by confrontations in Ruby Ridge, Idaho and Waco, Texas, culminating in a militia sympathizer's 1995 bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people. \nTheir numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years, driven by fears that President Barack Obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, estimates there were 276 active militias last year, up from 42 in 2008. \nIn recent years, armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of land-use disputes in the western United States. Federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon. \nMany fear Clinton would push the county further to the left. \n※This is the last chance to save America from ruin,§ Hill said. ※I'm surprised I was able to survive or suffer through eight years of Obama without literally going insane, but Hillary is going to be more of the same.§ \n\nEXTREMIST GROUPS EMBOLDENED \nThe Oath Keepers, a prominent anti-government force that sent gun-toting members to the 2014 race riots in Ferguson, Missouri, called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud. \nAn hour south of Atlanta, the Three Percent Security Force started the day around the campfire, taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range. They whooped with approval when blasts from one member's high-powered rifle knocked down a tree. \nThe group operates independently, but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government. The movement draws its name from the notion that no more than 3 percent of the American population fought in the Revolutionary War against Britain. \nAmid the war games, Hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on Washington if Clinton wins. \nHe said he doesn't want his members leading the way, but they will defend the protesters if need be. His group will not hesitate to act if a President Clinton tries to disarm gun owners, he said. \n※I will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen, and prevent them from being disarmed, and I will fight and I will kill and I may die in the process,§ said Hill, who founded the militia several years ago. \nTrump's candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law, said Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center. \n※Prior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape,§ he said. ※Now these ideas are legitimized.§ \nOver the past week, some prominent Trump supporters have hinted at violence. \n※If Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket,§ former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh wrote on Twitter last week. Conservative commentator Wayne Root fantasized about Clinton's death while speaking at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Sunday. \nBack in Georgia, the Three Percent Security Force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun. They then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides, ready for whatever may come. \n※We've building up for this, just like the Marines,§ he said. ※We are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come.§ Share On:",

    "text": "Hadi Would Be Figurehead to Placate Saudis by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This \nHeavily backed by Saudi Arabia, former Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's ambition to return as the ruler of Yemen appears to be waning, with a new UN peace plan proposal making the rounds that would sideline him more or less entirely. \nHadi's position has been contentious from the start. ※Elected§ in 2012 in a UN-mandated vote in which no opposition was allowed, Hadi was supposed to serve two years in office leading to a new constitution and free elections. The constitution never happened, and Hadi extended his reign unilaterally in 2014. He resigned in January 2015 when his anti-Houthi military offensive turned sour and he lost the capital. \nThe Saudis, primarily opposed to the Houthis because they're Shi'ites, insists to this day that Hadi remains the rightful ruler, and in March 2015 attacked Yemen, vowing to reinstall him. While the Houthis have expressed openness to a unity government that ends the conflict, they've also opposed it involving Hadi or his vice president Ali Mushin Ahmar, who they say were too corrupt to work with in a transitional government. \nThe UN plan seems largely to agree, as it would require Ahmar to resign outright, and would allow Hadi to remain only as a figurehead with no real power, instead seeking to stack the government with people both sides are likely to accept. \nThe decision to leave Hadi in at all appears to be designed to placate the Saudis, who vowed to reinstall him through their war, and would be able to claim that they succeeded under this deal, even if it ultimately means Hadi doesn't get any power.

Neither is the current occupant of the White House, nor were any of the Democrats, Republicans and Whigs that preceded him. \nOn a chilly November day in 2009 a newly-created coalition, of which I was a co-founder, marched on the White House to denounce and renounce Barack Obama as a tool of white supremacy and the imperial war machine. ※Obama, Obama, you can't hide  We charge you with genocide,§ we shouted, indicting the First Black President for the crimes he was busily committing in service to his masters on Wall Street. The Black is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations had been formed less than two months before, largely to demonstrate that not all Black people were bamboozled by the slick corporate politician from Chicago, elected one year earlier in the nation's first billion dollar presidential campaign. As the Coalition's founding press release stated : \n※Black and Brown people continue to suffer the brunt of un/under-employment and predatory loan scandal crises. Military spending under Obama has increased as have the warfare this nation continues to export to Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Venezuela and Colombia. Mass incarceration, police brutality and political imprisonment remain rampant...§ \nThe Black is Back Coalition warned of the ※traps set by Obama's so-called ＆post-racial' politics that perpetuates the same oppressive militarist agenda well known during the Bush regime.§ \nTo paraphrase Fidel Castro, history has vindicated us. \n※Obama joined George Bush and Bill Clinton in perpetuating the 20 year-long slaughter in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has claimed more than six million lives.§ \nObama mobilized NATO air forces and jihadist proxies to destroy Libya, which had previously enjoyed the highest living standard in Africa. He redeployed these same al Qaida terrorists to Syria, killing 400,000 people, displacing half the surviving population and bringing the U.S. to the very brink of nuclear war with Russia. This so-called ※Son of Africa§ has effectively occupied most of the continent through a U.S. Military Command (AFRICOM) that was less than a year old when Obama was sworn into office. The African Union provides diplomatic cover for the CIA-run ※peace keeping§ mission in Somalia, while U.S. conventional forces have infiltrated the militaries of all but two African nations. The holdouts, Eritrea and Zimbabwe, are under constant threat of regime change. Obama joined George Bush and Bill Clinton in perpetuating the 20 year-long slaughter in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has claimed more than six million lives, the worst genocide since World War Two (※Obama, Obama, you can't hide, We charge you with genocide!§) \nWith the eager assistance of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama baldly abetted a Nazi-spearheaded coup against the elected government in Ukraine -- and then blamed Moscow when Russian-speaking Ukrainians resisted, provoking a ※New Cold War§ that could turn hot in an instant. At the same time, Obama ※pivoted§ to militarily confront China, whose economy is already, by some measures, larger than the U.S. The jihadist war in Syria should also be seen as a theater of imperialism's last ditch offensive to encircle ※Eurasia§ in hopes of preserving U.S.-based multinational corporate domination of a ※rigged§ system of dollar-based world trade. \nJust as the Black is Back Coalition warned, Barack Obama was the Black face of imperialism -- a change of color without a difference. He tried to hand off the controls to Hillary Clinton, who got six million votes less than he did, and lost. \nBack in 2007, when Obama and Clinton were pretending to be ideological opponents -- as cookie-cutter corporate Democrats often do -- we at Black Agenda Report wrote that ※ There's not a dime's worth of difference § between the two. Every decent, peace-loving person on Earth should be glad to be rid of both of them. Humanity would probably not survive another year of either one. \n※Barack Obama was the Black face of imperialism -- a change of color without a difference.§ \nDonald Trump is also a danger to humanity, like every other U.S. chief executive since Truman nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If words mean anything, Trump starts off posing less of a doomsday international menace, since he claims to want to establish talking, rather than shouting, threatening, nuke-rattling relations with Russia and China, while Clinton's version of ※reset§ was an armed confrontation with Russia over the skies of Syria. Of course, all that could quickly change. Trump may be a ※party of one§ among Republicans in Congress and even in his own cabinet. \nFor those who fear Trump's ※fascism,§ the threat level depends on how he uses the arsenal of repressive tools bequeathed to him by the Obama administration. These legal, infrastructural and technological instruments of the national security state are fascist in their intent; they were made for the purpose of tracking, disorganizing, neutralizing and locking up dissidents, and disinforming the public at large. Thus, President Obama and his predecessors were fascist- minded , whether you call their administrations operatively fascist or not. The Obama administration would not have pushed a bill through Congress allowing the U.S. military to detain American citizens without trial or charge if he had not anticipating using it. He would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule. Fascist-minded is all that can be said of Trump, at this point, as well. \nBlack Lives Matter activists have been under FBI surveillance since day one. Ever since Ferguson, the federal government has taken the lead in over-charging ※rioters§ in rebellious cities. New York City cops have used social media surveillance as the basis for conspiracy charges against groups of more than 100 young Black people in separate sweeps in Manhattan and The Bronx. The ※fascism§ that correctly described Jim Crow rule in the pre-Civil Rights South lives on at the core of the mass Black incarceration regime put in place with the crushing of the Black Liberation Movement, two generations ago. The current movement against police terror, which ultimately demands Black community control of the police, put activists in direct confrontation with the coercive arm of the State. There is no retreat from this response to the demands of Black people ※on the street,§ who bear the daily brunt of repression and are also among the most effective organizers. \n※Obama would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule.§ \nThe Black movement against police terror didn't need a Donald Trump waiting in the vestibule of the White House to get ※mad.§ The movement has already crossed the Rubicon of confrontation with the State. The moment occurred in the second term of the First Black President, when a new generation learned that liberation cannot be vicariously experienced. The 21 st century Black movement emerged with the knowledge that Black corporate Democrats are not their allies, nor are Black police chiefs, or Black preachers whose real loyalties are to the Democratic Party and its Wall Street patrons. \nIf the Black movement were afraid of the likes of Donald Trump, it never would have gone up against the militarized police that occupy Black communities. You can't scare people with a specter if they have already been in combat with the real thing. \nTo the extent that electoral activity is useful to the movement, it should be employed with special vigilance close at hand, against misleaders like the 32 members of the Congressional Black Caucus who failed to support the Grayson Amendment that would have halted Pentagon transfers of weapons and equipment to local police departments. These ※ Treasonous 32 §, comprising 80 percent of full-voting Black Democrats in the House, cast their shameful votes in June, 2014, just two months before Michael Brown was shot down in Ferguson, Missouri. (Rep. William ※Lacy§ Clay, representing Michael Brown's district, was among the 32.) If the movement is to have any special targets for electoral vengeance, it is these homegrown enemies, who turn Black people's votes against themselves. \nTrump or no Trump, the Black movement must continue to press and refine its demands -- or Power will concede nothing. On November 6, after their annual march on the White House, the organizations of the Black is Back Coalition ratified a 19-point document that puts self-determination at the heart of the broadest range of issues confronting Black America: ※Every central demand, every strategy of struggle, must be formulated with the goal of self-determination in mind. Otherwise, the movement will allow itself to be drowned in reformist schemes and projects that bind Black people even more tightly to structures of outside control.§ The points range from ※Black Community Control of Police,§ to ※Halting Gentrification,§ to ※Nationalization of the Banks.§ \nThe points were compiled during Barack Obama's time in the White House, and they will remain relevant under a President Donald Trump. \nWe've been mad. Let's get organized, and get free.",

The Obama administration would not have pushed a bill through Congress allowing the U.S. military to detain American citizens without trial or charge if he had not anticipating using it. He would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule. Fascist-minded is all that can be said of Trump, at this point, as well. \nBlack Lives Matter activists have been under FBI surveillance since day one. Ever since Ferguson, the federal government has taken the lead in over-charging ※rioters§ in rebellious cities. New York City cops have used social media surveillance as the basis for conspiracy charges against groups of more than 100 young Black people in separate sweeps in Manhattan and The Bronx. The ※fascism§ that correctly described Jim Crow rule in the pre-Civil Rights South lives on at the core of the mass Black incarceration regime put in place with the crushing of the Black Liberation Movement, two generations ago. The current movement against police terror, which ultimately demands Black community control of the police, put activists in direct confrontation with the coercive arm of the State. There is no retreat from this response to the demands of Black people ※on the street,§ who bear the daily brunt of repression and are also among the most effective organizers. \n※Obama would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule.§ \nThe Black movement against police terror didn't need a Donald Trump waiting in the vestibule of the White House to get ※mad.§ The movement has already crossed the Rubicon of confrontation with the State. The moment occurred in the second term of the First Black President, when a new generation learned that liberation cannot be vicariously experienced. The 21 st century Black movement emerged with the knowledge that Black corporate Democrats are not their allies, nor are Black police chiefs, or Black preachers whose real loyalties are to the Democratic Party and its Wall Street patrons. \nIf the Black movement were afraid of the likes of Donald Trump, it never would have gone up against the militarized police that occupy Black communities. You can't scare people with a specter if they have already been in combat with the real thing. \nTo the extent that electoral activity is useful to the movement, it should be employed with special vigilance close at hand, against misleaders like the 32 members of the Congressional Black Caucus who failed to support the Grayson Amendment that would have halted Pentagon transfers of weapons and equipment to local police departments. These ※ Treasonous 32 §, comprising 80 percent of full-voting Black Democrats in the House, cast their shameful votes in June, 2014, just two months before Michael Brown was shot down in Ferguson, Missouri. (Rep. William ※Lacy§ Clay, representing Michael Brown's district, was among the 32.) If the movement is to have any special targets for electoral vengeance, it is these homegrown enemies, who turn Black people's votes against themselves. \nTrump or no Trump, the Black movement must continue to press and refine its demands -- or Power will concede nothing. On November 6, after their annual march on the White House, the organizations of the Black is Back Coalition ratified a 19-point document that puts self-determination at the heart of the broadest range of issues confronting Black America: ※Every central demand, every strategy of struggle, must be formulated with the goal of self-determination in mind. Otherwise, the movement will allow itself to be drowned in reformist schemes and projects that bind Black people even more tightly to structures of outside control.§ The points range from ※Black Community Control of Police,§ to ※Halting Gentrification,§ to ※Nationalization of the Banks.§ \nThe points were compiled during Barack Obama's time in the White House, and they will remain relevant under a President Donald Trump. \nWe've been mad. Let's get organized, and get free. BAR executive editor Glen Ford can be contacted",

    "text": "Goldman Sachs Endorses Hillary Clinton For President   Shadowproof \nHe's with her. On Sunday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein 〞an endorsement she had been working toward for years. \nAs was revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation. \nOn October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for ※political reasons§ because Congress needed to look like it was doing something about the crisis. She said, ※There's nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.§ \nYes, she essentially endorsed Wall Street writing the rules because Wall Street knows its business best and complained to Goldman Sachs that regulations had frightened bankers. \n※I mean, right now, there are so many places in our country where the banks are not doing what they need to do because they're scared of regulations, they're scared of the other shoe dropping, they're just plain scared, so credit is not flowing the way it needs to to restart economic growth,§ Clinton said. ※So people are, you know, a little 〞 they're still uncertain, and they're uncertain both because they don't know what might come next in terms of regulations, but they're also uncertain because of changes in a global economy that we're only beginning to take hold of.§ \nMusic to Wall Street's ears. For Goldman Sachs, was there really any other choice this cycle? After all, they did pay Hillary Clinton $675,000 for those three speeches, and have generously supported her political career. \nDespite her private comments to Goldman Sachs, Hillary Clinton has taken a tough public position on Wall Street during the campaign, likely due to Senator Bernie Sanders' success in the primaries. Of course, Wikileaks also revealed that Clinton told the National Multi-housing Council in a private speech that ※you need both a public and a private position.§ \nSo the real question is, what do Blankfein and Goldman want in return and what is Clinton's private position on giving it to them?

    "text": "Email \nWith Election Day fast approaching, citizens everywhere are bracing themselves for an uncertain future. Fortunately, no matter what happens, there's at least one truth that voters from both sides can hang their hats on: Political scientists have confirmed that the outcome of the presidential election will in no way affect ketchup. \nWhew! What a tremendous relief! \nTrump or Clinton, whoever takes the office in November, ketchup will still be red, salty, and sweet, according to leading experts. Despite a range of conflicting policies listed on the candidates' websites, they are in full agreement about ketchup, a substance neither candidate plans to change in any way. Americans can be certain that a vote cast on November 8 is a vote that in no way alters the familiar appearance, flavor, or viscosity of ketchup. \nKetchup fans rejoice! \nWhether 2017 marks the beginning of higher taxes for high-income households per Clinton's plan or tax cuts across all income brackets per Trump's, ketchup will remain exactly the same condiment it's always been. Regardless of how the next four years change U.S. immigration policy, and no matter whether they see the passage of the DREAM Act or the construction of a border wall, ketchup will abide by the same recipe and will be available in the same variety of packaging. \nIf you had any doubts about the future of ketchup, it looks like you can breathe easy. No doubt, the outcome of one of the most divisive elections in history will bring about certain changes, but there will be none for ketchup. If you love ketchup the way it is, then it's already time to celebrate.",

    "text": "Email \nThe president has to be kicking himself over this one. \nAs his term in office comes to a close, it seems as if Barack Obama may have missed out on a pretty spectacular opportunity. Earlier today, the president was told that he had been allowed to sleep in the White House this whole time, after he spent nearly two full terms living in a hotel by Reagan National Airport. \nSorry, Mr. President, but it's true. You really blew your chance on this one. \nHaving booked an extended stay at the airport Hilton upon his inauguration back in 2009, Barack and his family have resided in an atrium-view room with two double beds and complimentary wi-fi for the past eight years. But earlier this week when a senior advisor asked the president why he had chosen to live by the airport instead of the White House, you could tell that Obama hadn't realized the choice was his to make until that very moment. \nYes, Obama's accomplished a lot over the years, but he's got to be wondering how much more progress he might have made living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He would have had a lot more time to work on signature policies like the Affordable Care Act if he hadn't wasted so much of his mornings commuting from the airport to the Oval Office on the D.C. Metro. There's no doubt the countless Hilton Rewards Points Obama has accrued is a nice perk, but that doesn't soften the blow of leaving the neoclassic mansion built exclusively to house the commander in chief and his family empty for two full terms. \nThis is something Obama is going to regret for a long time to come. \n※Nobody ever explicitly told me that I could live there until now,§ said a clearly disappointed Obama, as he waited patiently for a set of fresh towels. ※While Sasha and Malia love being on the same floor as the pool here, I now wish we had stayed at the lavish, 20,000-square-foot private residence in the White House for the past eight years. One time in 2011, I slept underneath my desk after a late night, and I was worried someone was going to find me there in the morning and yell at me. Now I'm being told we apparently have a personal chef and dozens of butlers. This sucks.§ \nSorry, Barry, but this one's kind of on you. Our advice to whoever the next president is? Don't miss your chance like he did.",

But, when Hillary lost on Tuesday, that meant something incredible for Kimberly: She still gets to dream of being the first female president. \nWow! This must be a truly special moment for Kimberly. \nThe moment Hillary Clinton made her concession speech Wednesday morning, Kimberly's opportunity to become the first woman elected to the Oval Office opened right back up. Though it may not be for 40, 50, maybe even 60 years, this key milestone in feminism is all Kimberly's to aspire toward. \nSome may say that another woman will be elected the first female president in the three decades before Kimberly's even eligible to run, but if the 2016 election is any indication, it looks like she is still very much in the running to break the gender barrier in the Oval Office. Who knows? Kimberly could even be the first female president to re-legalize abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned at some point in the next four years! \nIt must feel truly incredible for girls in America to see that this huge accomplishment is still on the table, theirs for the eventual taking. The fact that America's ugliest, most intolerant tendencies prevailed over Clinton means millions of girls can still envisage themselves as the one to make that landmark feminist achievement, and it doesn't get more powerful than that. \nYup, we're uplifted as hell right now〞you go, Kimberly!

    "text": "Email \nGet ready for the most cringeworthy story you're going to read all day. \nPanasonic might be one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, but after today, they may find themselves struggling to stay afloat. The company's president has been forced to resign in disgrace after 60,000 Panasonic TVs abruptly ascended to heaven without warning. \nWe'll give you a minute to finish shaking your head. \nThe scandal broke early last night when 60,000 of the company's popular DX802-model flat-screen TVs from all over the world silently lifted off of the ground and, despite their owners yelling at them to stop and trying to drag them back down to Earth, floated away from the mortal realm and into the kingdom of heaven to reside with the immortal seraphim for all eternity. \nYikes. Needless to say, Panasonic customers are not happy! Only a few minutes after the televisions began their skyward journey to the kingdom of God, Panasonic found themselves completely inundated with tweets like this: \nWow. Panasonic definitely wishes it could rewind the clock on this one! Chances are, when you're trying to stay competitive as one of the world's foremost electronics companies, the last thing you want is for tens of thousands of your televisions to drift skyward into paradise. \nWe've got to give credit where credit is due: At least Panasonic had the decency to admit that they let their customers down. The company has issued a public apology, and in a drastic move, the president of the company, Kazuhiro Tsuga, chose to resign in the wake of this scandal. Speaking at a press conference this morning, Tsuga issued the following statement: \n※After much consideration, I have chosen to step down as the president of Panasonic Corp. If I could, I would travel to Heaven and retrieve each and every one of these televisions. I would kill any angel who tried to stop me from carrying these TVs out of paradise and returning them to our loyal Panasonic customers on Earth. Even if I saw God sitting on one of our missing DX802 flat-screens, I would shove the Lord off of the TV so that I could retrieve it for our customers. Unfortunately, I do not have the power to travel to Heaven, and so I am left with no choice but to resign my position.§ \nTsuga's resignation is a nice gesture, but it doesn't bring back a swarm of televisions from heaven. Panasonic's reputation has been severely tarnished by the rapturing of their televisions. Whoever steps up to become Panasonic's new president is going to have to do everything they can to prevent any of their products from ascending to heaven ever again.",

    "text": "※ The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society . Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. §  Edward Bernays (※the father of public relations§), Propaganda , 1928 (note that Bernays' book, Propaganda , begins with the above quote).   If you told somebody 10 years ago that there existed some sort of secret group or ※secret government§ pulling the strings behind the scenes of government policy, international law, various global rules/regulations, and more, they would have called you a ※conspiracy theorist.§ Today things have changed, largely as a result of information leaked by Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, and various other whistleblowers and activists in recent years. Their bravery has shed light on the world of secrecy that's been blinding the masses since its inception. I've mentioned this before, and I'll mention it again, did you know that the U.S. Government classifies more than 500 million pages of documents each year? Did you know that the United States has a history of government agencies existing in secret? For example, the National Security Agency (NSA) was founded in 1952, but its existence was hidden until the mid 1960's. Even more secretive is the National Reconnaissance Office, it was founded in 1960 but remained completely secret for 30 years. Then we have the entire black budget world, a world dominated by secrecy that was officially revealed by Edward Snowden a couple of years ago. This deals with what are known as ※Special Access Programs.§ It's not just statements that these ※high-level§ people are making. It's all of the proof and evidence that goes along with it. ***You can read more about the black budget HERE *** Canadian Defence Minister Paul Hellyer Former Minister of National Defence, Paul Hellyer, is one of Canada's best known and most controversial politicians. He was first elected in 1949, and was the youngest cabinet minister appointed to Louis S. St. Laurent's government eight years later. He held senior posts in the governments of Lester B. Pearson and Pierre E. Trudeau. He achieved the rank of senior master (Deputy Prime Minister), and went on to become the Canadian Defence Minister. He is best known for the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces, and in September 2005 he became the first person of cabinet rank in the G8 group of countries to state unequivocally that ※UFOs are as real as the airplanes flying overhead.§   Here's what he had to say about the world of secrecy: It is ironic that the U.S. would begin a devastating war, allegedly in search of weapons of mass destruction, when the most worrisome developments in this field are occurring in your own backyard. It is ironic that the U.S. should be fighting monstrously expensive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, allegedly to bring democracy to those countries, when it itself can no longer claim to be called a democracy, when trillions, and I mean thousands of billions of dollars have been spent on projects about which both the Congress and the Commander in Chief have been kept deliberately in the dark. ( source ) The 28th U.S. President Woodrow Wilson Woodrow Wilson, an American academic, politician, and the 28th president of the United States, had this to say (among other things) in his book The New Freedom . The book also contains several other, similarly eye-opening statements: Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it. ( source ) The 35th U.S. President John F. Kennedy Here's what JFK had to say in one of his most famous speeches: The very word ※secrecy§ is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. ＃ For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influenceon infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. ( source ) John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President of The United States John C. Calhoun was the 7th Vice President of the United States, from 1825-1832. He was also a political theorist during the first half of the 19th century. Here's what he had to say: A power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves, consisting of many, and various, and powerful interests, combined into one mass, and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks.

So much deceit goes on. . . . whether it's a Republican or a Democrat president, the people who want to keep the status quo seems to have their finger in the pot and can control things. They just get so nervous so, if they have an independent thinker out there, whether it's Sanders, or Trump, or Ron Paul, they're going to be very desperate to try to change things. . . . More people are discovering that the system is all rigged, and that voting is just pacification for the voters and it really doesn't count.§ advertisement - learn more Above are the words of Dr. Ron Paul, three-time presidential candidate and a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Similar to Bernie Sanders, Dr. Paul attracted significant attention while he was in the running, appealing to the intellect of the masses and helping to wake people up to the realities of the U.S. electoral system. U.S. presidential elections are rigged. This is the truth that he, and Sanders, and so many others, hope to make clear. Voting only provides the illusion of democracy, it does not actually serve democracy. In the video below, Dr. Paul goes on to describe how the electoral process has become a giant charade, meant to entertain rather facilitate democracy. He also argues that who exactly is chosen for president is irrelevant, because corporate interests will always prevent them from effecting real change. In a recent debate with Hilary Clinton, Bernie Sanders made the same arguments, saying that ※no matter who is elected to be president, that person . . . will not be able to succeed because the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, (and) the power of campaign donors is so great that no president alone can stand up to them.§ ( source ) It is an uncomfortable truth, as Bernie himself admits, but it is a reality we must face. And hearing this for the first time can be jarring, to be sure. We've been told that the world operates in a specific way, that we decide who our political leaders will be, but as with anything in life, it's important that we discover the truth for ourselves rather than trusting blindly the words of others. We have been programmed to believe everything we are told, and corporate media is not telling us the truth. Dr. Paul and Bernie Sanders are not the only major political figures to speak out about this issue. Various presidents and politicians have been saying this for decades. For example, Theodore Roosevelt, the 26 President of the United States, told the world that ※behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.§ He also stated that ※presidents are selected, not elected.§ Even the very first British MP, Benjamin Disraeli, warned us that ※the world is governed by very different personages to what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.§ Here is a very memorable quote from former New York City (1918-1925) Mayor John F.

Your Inbox Will Never Be The Same Inspiration and all our best content, straight to your inbox. \n※Democracy is popular because of the illusion of choice and participation it provides, but when you live in a society in which most people's knowledge of the world extends as far as sports, sitcoms, reality shows, and celebrity gossip, democracy because a very dangerous idea. Until people are properly educated and informed, instead of indoctrinated to be ignorant mindless consumers, democracy is nothing more than a clever tool used by the ruling class to subjugate the rest of of us.§  Gavin Nascimento. Presidents now seem to be little more than figureheads, meant to capture the hearts and attention of the people while leaving corporations (controlled by the big banks) free to do as they will, polluting and destroying our planet in their endless quest for profit. Barack Obama was a big time celebrity, and there is no doubt in my mind that Hillary Clinton will be the same by taking on the role of ※first female president.§ While this is obviously a commendable and much-needed step forward for gender quality, I think we need to take a step back and consider the bigger picture. We can't look to our political leaders for change, we have to look to ourselves, because our desires are not being represented or addressed in the political sphere. The ongoing GMO debate is just one example of this, but there are many. If we want to change the things which matter the most 〞 the degradation of the environment, the military industrial complex, poverty, among others 〞 we can't keep looking to political ＆leaders' like Obama or international organizations like the UN, all of whom give empty speeches, year after year, like they've always done, without taking real action.

Change can only come from you and from me, and the first step is awareness. See the circus for what it is and choose not to participate. If we keep looking to ＆them' to provide the solutions we need to take care of our planet, we will continue down this road to destruction. It's how we got here in the first place.

    "title": "BREAKING: President Of Argentina Reveals Obama Secretly Gave Iran Nuclear Fuel | Conservative Daily Post",
    "text": "Posted by Damon Morgan | Nov 10, 2016 | National Security Former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Got the Better of Obama in Nuclear Talks \nOn September 28, 2015, Argentinean President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner dropped a bombshell on the floor of the UN General Assembly 70th session. Until now, her story has been swept under the rug by a news media which has always been deferential to President Obama. \nMs. Kirchner told the story of how Argentina was visited by the White House in November 2010, with a secretive and unusual request. A full English translation of her speech is available here. \nDuring the time the event took place, Obama had just faced a stinging rebuke in midterm elections which saw a Republican takeover of the House, led by the insurgent Tea Party. The results of that election were a direct threat to Obama's mandate. Wikipedia describes the incredible upset this way: \nRepublicans regained control of the chamber they had lost in the 2006 midterm elections, picking up a net total of 63 seats and erasing the gains Democrats made in 2006 and 2008. Although the sitting U.S. President's party usually loses seats in a midterm election, the 2010 election resulted in the highest loss of a party in a House midterm election since 1938, and the largest House swing since 1948. This also happened to be the Republicans' largest gain in House seats since 1938. \nUnder the shadow of this election, Obama became concerned about the possibility of being a one-term president and leaving a damaged legacy. He had not been able to accomplish any notable achievements as president, and the economy was still reeling from the aftershocks of the 2008 real estate and stock market crashes. Obama Was Desperate for a Deal with Iran \nObama had been negotiating with Iran regarding their nuclear ambitions, and the world was watching. But negotiations had bogged down, with then Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad insisting on the need for nuclear fuel as part of the deal. \nAccording to Kirchner, the Obama White House intended to sidestep congressional approval and media scrutiny by quietly hatching a scheme where third party nations would supply the fuel. \nShe told the UN Assembly that Argentina was approached by a representative of Obama's White House, Gary Samore, who at the time served as the top adviser on nuclear issues. \n※Gary Samore had explained to our Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hctor Timerman, that negotiations were underway for the Islamic Republic of Iran to cease with its uranium enrichment activities or to do it to a lesser extent but Iran claimed that it needed to enrich this Tehran nuclear reactor and this was hindering negotiations. They came to ask us, Argentines, to provide the Islamic Republic of Iran with nuclear fuel.§ said Kirchner. \nShe went on to explain that Mr. Samore presented the following options: \nThe simplest and quickest one was for Argentina to provide the new nuclear fuel, as the original fuel had been designed by Argentina, who owned the intellectual property rights. \nAnother alternative was for Argentina to authorize Russia to supply the uranium, following the Argentine design. \nThe last alternative was for the United States or some other country with nuclear capacity to replace the operating core of the nuclear reactor with a new one using other non-Argentine fuel. \nPresident Kirchner was willing to help, but the issue was politically tricky. Argentina had been the original producer of the nuclear fuel used in the Tehran reactor, and held intellectual property claims to the material. However, there was ongoing tension between Iran and Argentina due to a terrorist bombing in 1994. \nThe AMIA bombing was an attack on the Asociacin Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA; Argentine Israelite Mutual Association) building. It occurred in Buenos Aires on 18 July 1994, killing 85 people and injuring hundreds. It was Argentina's deadliest bombing ever. The Bombing of the AMIA Building was the Deadliest in Argentina's History \nAfter a long series of incompetent and corrupt investigations into the incident, in 2005 Argentine prosecutors Alberto Nisman and Marcelo Martnez Burgos formally accused the government of Iran of directing the bombing, and the Hezbollah militia of carrying it out. According to the prosecution's claims in 2006, Argentina had been targeted by Iran after Buenos Aires' decision to suspend a nuclear technology transfer contract to Tehran \nArgentina's justice, Israel, and the United States suspected in 2005 that Hezbollah was behind the attack, with backing from Iran. Hezbollah has denied responsibility. The Iranian government maintains its innocence, condemning the terrorist attack and calling for urgent punishment of those responsible. \nAfter many years spent on the case, Special Prosecutor Alberto Nisman was found dead in his home, on January 18, 2015. His body was discovered just six hours before he was due to explain his findings to congress. The official cause of death was a single self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, but there is a haze of suspicion surrounding the case. Argentinians March in Protest of the Lack of Justice for the AMIA Bombing \nTo this day the bombing case remains unresolved, and Iran has refused to extradite any of the suspects involved. \nPresident Kirchner continued with her address to the UN, explaining that she attempted to follow standard protocol and receive the White House request in writing: \nYou know that Argentina is a member of the select club of nuclear energy producing countries but that we occupy, nonetheless, a leading position in the field of non-proliferation. This means that non-nuclear proliferation is also a matter of governmental interest to us as well. \nI said as much to my Minister of Foreign Affairs who in turn relayed this to the White House's envoy, Gary Samore that we would accept to provide the fuel because it was in the hands of Argentina since 1987 and we also had the technique to produce it in exchange, obviously, for such request to be submitted in writing and signed. This message was conveyed and I believe that was the last time, after that communication, that our Minister of Foreign Affairs saw Gary Samore. \nSo, after her demand that the request for nuclear fuel be provided on the official record, the U.S. representative vanished and the issue was never mentioned to Kirchner again. This shows that it was intended to be a clandestine deal from the beginning, hidden from the American people. Former Iranian President Ahmadinejad Tours Nuclear Processing Facility \nWas Obama hoping to emerge as a hero after successfully negotiating a deal with Iran? If so, that effort fell flat. Recent investigations have revealed that he attempted another scheme in 2016 which involved making a cash down payment to Iran of more than a billion dollars, in order to secure the release of American hostages and to advance nuclear talks. \nWhen it comes to an issue as important as nuclear proliferation in radical Islamist nations, we need a president who will engage the issue with transparency, and in the interest of the American people and world community. President Trump will likely succeed where Obama has failed.",

    "text": "Who's to Blame for President Trump? November 12, 2016 \nExclusive: Team Clinton thought the path to the White House led through a neo-McCarthyistic assault on Donald Trump as Vladimir Putin's puppet, rather than addressing the real worries of Americans, writes James W Carden. \nBy James W Carden \nWatching the returns come in on the morning of Nov. 9, my mind turned immediately to the question of blame. How could it be that someone so manifestly unqualified for the White House managed to beat a candidate who was widely acknowledged to be the most highly qualified person ever to have run for the nation's highest office? \nFor answers, look no further than the hierarchy of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee under Debbie Wasserman Shultz, and, later, longtime Democratic operative and talking head Donna Brazile. Donald Trump speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. June 18, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) \n\nFirst, as Wikileaks has proven without a shadow of a doubt, it is clear that the DNC colluded with the Clinton campaign as well as with highly placed sources at CNN to fatally undermine and sabotage the progressive insurgency campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. \nThroughout the primary, the Clintons and their vast network of high-profile surrogates in the media sought to undercut Sanders by painting his supporters as not only completely unrealistic in their expectations for what government can and should do, but as a group of bullying misogynists as well. \nOnce they managed to push Sanders out of the way, they launched a general election campaign that was stunning in both its incompetence and its cynicism. That the campaign was badly run can hardly come as a surprise, staffed as it was by a young, startlingly vapid campaign manager by name of Robby Mook. \nPolicy was handled by the equally young and wondrously overrated former head of the policy planning staff at the U.S. State Department, Jake Sullivan. On the evidence of its policy papers and press releases, the campaign, which relied on such ※outsiders§ as Center for American Progress president Neera Tanden, clearly decided that once Sanders was defeated, they had no lessons to learn from his candidacy. \nIgnoring America's Needs \nThey failed to recognize that despite the laughably inaccurate Labor Department unemployment statistics, which claim the U.S. unemployment rate is just under 5 percent, millions upon millions of Americans are without work, and are increasingly without hope. \nA country which ranks right along side Albania and Bosnia in incidents of infant morality; a country which has a Gini coefficient (a measure of income inequality) on par with Cameroon; a country with nearly 25 million of its citizens addicted to drugs and alcohol; a country that has a crumbling infrastructure and bad schools is a country whose government has repeatedly failed them. The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads ※Vote Trump§ on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr) \nHillary Clinton, a former First Lady, U.S. Senator, and Secretary of State is, as Donald Trump rightly surmised, widely seen as the face of that government, as the face of those failures. \nBut instead of addressing the well-founded angst among large swathes of the population, Clinton and her team decided the path to victory would open up not by addressing Trump's substantive critique of the American economy or his entirely appropriate (though never too well thought-out) questioning of the American imperium. No: Team Clinton, Mook, Sullivan, Podesta and Tanden had a better idea. Let us tie the albatross of Russian president Vladimir Putin around the neck of the gloriously unqualified billionaire candidate. \nThat, according to Team Clinton, was just the ticket. And so, as I pointed out in the pages of ConsortiumNews as the campaign was ending, the Clinton's pursued a policy of Red-baiting with abandon. During each debate, at any of Trump's mentions of Russia, the Clinton campaign apparatus would kick into high gear and release a flurry of press releases designed to cast doubt not only on Trump's character but on his patriotism. \nUnfounded and undocumented accusations of the Trump campaign's illusory connection to the Kremlin were repeated ad nauseam by prominent voices of the liberal intelligentsia like MSNBC's Joy Reid, New York Magazine's Jon Chait, New America Fellow Franklin Foer, Mother Jones editor David Corn, among many others. \nTheir efforts failed in spectacular fashion in the early morning hours of Nov. 9. The electorate at long last has risen up against the suffocating, foolish and impoverishing neoliberal consensus, which has held sway in Washington for the past 25 years. The rush to normalize trade relations with China, the unbelievably damaging free trade agreements with Mexico, the vast governmental subsidization of Wall Street have ruined and, yes, ended more lives than the many wars this country has been unnecessarily been waging for the past 15 years. \nAs the University of Michigan's Juan Cole recently pointed out: ※A year ago Anne Case and Angus Deaton, Princeton University economists, published a study with the startling finding that since 1999 death rates have been going up for white Americans aged 45-54. It is even worse than it sounds, since death rates were declining for the general population.§ \nIn other words, neoliberalism at home and neoconservatism abroad are killing Americans (as well as people in countries where the U.S. government has imposed ※regime change§ solutions). Yet instead of addressing the long, slow and sad decline of the U.S. in the quarter century following the end of the first Cold War, Clinton, Podesta, Mook and Sullivan decided that the correct course of action would be to dream up a fictitious Manchurian candidate scenario in order to defeat Trump, a candidate who, for all of his obvious faults, at least spoke to the problems of ordinary people. \nIn short: The Clintons and their friends and enablers in the Democratic Party and in the media have only themselves to blame for President-elect Donald J. Trump. \nJames W Carden is a contributing writer for The Nation and editor of The American Committee for East-West Accord's eastwestaccord.com.

    "text": "11/15/2016 at 6:06 am \nEven after the election the Clinton side continues with lawless agitation, intimidation and violence in the streets, demonstrating to reasonable people everywhere that Americans did make the right choice. Thank you MSM and Mr. Soros for showing everyone just how free, democratic, big hearted and open the globalist new world order would really be if Hillary had won. \nIf the US election rules had been that the candidates had to win the popular vote in order to be elected, then Trump would have campaigned more vigorously in the large cities and likely also would have won that contest in a landslide. But how much more of a landslide that would have been can be seen by considering what really happened. \nThe people who supported Trump mainly voted for jobs and to save core values and constitutional rights from a misguided globalism being imposed upon them. They were essentially voting to save their nation from an establishment which has been systematically outsourcing just about everything which matters to them. However, despite the stakes they were and remain essentially principled people adhering to the electoral rules of fair play for lawful democratic change. The Clinton side on the other hand appeared devoid of any real principles other than their own interests. During the election the Clinton side used intimidation tactics of paid agitators. They cheated by swelling voters lists by opening the border and signing up droves of illegal immigrants. Even voter fraud and rigged voting machines were acceptable to them. But most of all they were supported by an absolutely biased, corrupt and lying mainstream media. The effect of the media was so pervasive that Trump supporters were generally so ridiculed and shunned that few made their views known. Without such dishonest, illegal and oppressive tactics by the Clinton side, the Trump vote would most certainly have been much much greater. In the circumstances the Clinton loss could not be more embarrassing for her, her party and the MSM. \nPaul Formby",

    "title": "Trump The President: What Does That Mean For The World? - CounterCurrents.org",
    "text": "in World 〞 by Mirza Yawar Baig 〞 November 10, 2016 \nWhew! Finally, the charade is over. Donald Trump is now the President of the United States of America. What does that mean? It means that Simpsons prediction came true: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2146815/the-simpsons-correctly-predicted-a-donald-trump-presidency-16-years-ago-in-episode-set-in-the-near-future/ \nSo now you know who to refer to for accurate predictions about the future. Goodbye Tarot cards, et al. In 1995 I recall reading a survey which concluded that America was not likely to be ready for a woman president for the next twenty years. Twenty-one years later, it looks like that prediction was true. Given that women in America to this day are paid 80% of what men are paid, it is not surprising that Americans find it tough to visualize a woman in the White House in any place other than the President's bed. \nSo, what does Trump mean for America, for American Muslims, for Muslims worldwide, for non-whites in America and globally? I am asking this rhetorical question as I see all kinds of doomsday predictions flying around. I apologize for taking a different view. I see the Trump presidency as an opportunity for those who believe in the opposite of everything that Donald Trump promoted in his campaign to put their actions where their mouths are and show that they are as willing to stand up for what they believe in as he was. \nWhat does Trump mean for America? I hope he will be the best thing that happened to America ever. I hope that he can truly make ＆America Great Again'. I say that because though I am not American (should I say, ＆Thank God?'), I am one who believes that a truly ＆Great America', can make this world great. The world truly needs to change. We need someone to lead the way to make the world compassionate, caring, fighting against injustice, corruption and poverty; disease and ignorance. Which nation is better suited to lead that fight? America has the resources, the intelligence, the education and the leadership ability which I hope it chooses to exercise. Trump won on the anti-establishment platform. I support that fully. The establishment has shown that what it can do is to fail spectacularly. The economy crashed and Obama rewarded those who crashed it. People were and are homeless when there are empty homes on foreclosed loans enough for every American to have two homes, not only one. Yet they are on the streets. I hope Trump can put Americans back in their own homes. \nBush father and son, started never ending wars. Obama continued them adding his own flavor to it of drone strikes  using technology to create bug splats (the arrogance is incredible)  thereby escalating the global threat level that comes from driving people to desperation. Obama's dabbling (what else to call it?) in Middle Eastern politics resulted in continuing the misery for people of Afghanistan and Iraq and new misery for people of Syria and by inference for the rest of the world. And to top it all ISIS came into being because of all of the above. The credit can be shared by all of them. So, Trump standing against the establishment means that he is against all of this. I sincerely hope so. \nAll the jingoism that he rode on will get tempered when it comes to facing reality. It is easy to talk about kicking out the Mexicans and so on. But the day he does that, reality will dawn on him and his cohorts like it did on those who voted Pro-Brexit; that the rich need the poor to survive while the poor don't need the rich. When nice white Americans get to pay $3 per potato, they will realize the value of cheap labor. Meanwhile some contractor will get the contract to build the Wall, which he will do from the Mexican side, no doubt as otherwise his margin will not make it worthwhile. So also, the wonderful idea to outlaw the H-1 visa. I don't think it will take very long for Trump and his gang to realize that there is a reason there are blond jokes. And that Indians are not blond. Go figure that. \nThe good news is that Trump made public what was private  racism, misogyny in a country that never stops ＆trumpeting' about women's equality, support for genocide, wars and weapons sales, the evils of unbridled capitalism, locker-room conversations which indicate attitudes  have all come out of the closet and locker-room. Now it is up to those who like to say that they believe in the opposite of all these things, to get off their backsides and bring about change. They can no longer live the lives of pretense and lies that they had become used to, saying, ＆It is not happening here.' Trump proved that it is happening and has trumpeted it from the top of Trump tower. Sorry for so much bad punning in one breath. But there you go. \nAs for Muslims and Trump, believe me Trump is far better than what Muslims have seen in the past. He is far better than what we have today. Take Sisi, the Oily royals who are personal friends of every weapons dealer, the Paki leadership and I can think of several more and Trump begins to look like a choir boy. What will he do that is not already happening? Frankly I don't know and don't care to speculate because the prime movers behind Muslim affairs and how they are, are Muslims themselves. Our leadership or more correctly its spectacular failure. Ordinary citizens pay the price, but what's new about that? The fact remains that until we sort that out and do something about taking charge of our destiny, we must remain satisfied with others writing the script we are compelled to live by. Play endings depend on the script, not on the players. \nIndia is a classic example where a so-called minority of 200 million is kicked around like a football and used at will by every mercenary politician for his own ends. But Indian Muslims seem to be satisfied with that, so who is anyone else to complain. If you disagree and tell me that they are not satisfied, then I must ask you what it is that prevents them from doing what is glaringly obvious; get their act together, change their leaders and write their own script. 200 million is not a minority. It is a nation. But only if it chooses to be. Same story for Muslims globally. No point in blaming Trump or looking up to him to find solutions. It is our problem and we must solve it, so let us start doing that. \nTwo other points: what about wars, global warming and such issues? Well, when you have a nation that lives on perpetual warfare and is supported in that by all the other major industrial nations who either manufacture and sell weapons or buy them, how can you pin it all on Trump? If weapons are made and sold, there will be wars. Wars will happen if they continue to make profits for those who run them. That people die is incidental. Those at the top who laugh all the way to the bank, don't. Those that do, don't count. They are ＆collateral', who are necessary to prove the efficacy of the weapons that were used to vaporize them. If it wasn't for the bugs who splatted, how would you assess the drones or their operators? The fact that the bugs were innocent or that they had families and so on; well, bugs are bugs. And that's all that there is to it. \nGlobal warming? America decided on that when it chose Bush instead of Al Gore. For a minute I thought that was because they got confused because his name is Al Gore like Al Ghurair. But then I realized that it was because he had a terminal problem; he had a brain. See his famous movie, An Inconvenient Truth, and you will see what I mean. https://www.algore.com/library/an-inconvenient-truth-dvd If you do nothing else, buy this and see it. At least you will know why you died. Since you chose that, especially Americans, I believe it is only fair that you understand what you did. With Trump, that came out in the open, so get used to summer all year long. You won't need to go to the French Riviera for a tan. You can get it at home. That is not inconvenient. \nAdd to this the effect ofunending wars, refugee movement, changing cultures, security nightmares coming true, widening gap between the rich and the poor, global poverty and hunger, preventable disease which is not prevented because there's no profit in it  when I think about all this and Trump's election, Nero comes to mind. Renewing our link with tradition. Let us dance to the tune. What's the use of fiddling otherwise? \nFinal question that everyone is asking, ＆How safe is it to have someone like Trump with his finger on the nuclear button?' \nMy answer is, ＆The one who actually pressed that button was as different from Trump as could be. Yet he did it.' Let me leave you to figure out the rest. \nMeanwhile it is midnight where I live, far away from Trump and America and time to go to bed. Truly it is said that there is solace in sleep. So, good night, world. Sleep well. As long as you stay asleep you can escape responsibility. \nMirza Yawar Baig is based in Hyderabad, India and is the founder and President of Yawar Baig & Associates; an international leadership consulting organization.

    "text": "Email \nWhy does everyone think that presidential campaigns are about ※issues,§ when anyone over the age of consent knows they are all about sex? But it says a lot about the lasting power of Viagra that this is still the case when we have a couple of seventy-year-olds on the ballot. (※ For an election lasting more than four years, please call your doctor .§) \nIn last week's newspaper there was a report on the tenth or eleventh woman (I have lost track) to come forward to say that Donald Trump made suggestive and ※inappropriate§ advances to her during a golf tournament that took place about ten years ago. \nThe woman in question is Jessica Drake, who during her press conference announced that at the time of the tournament, she was working in the ※the adult industry§ (that's what People Magazine calls porn) for Wicked Pictures (the 20th Century Fox of gang banging) when the randy Donald kissed and hugged her in his room. \nTrump was already in his pajamas when she knocked on his door, together with two friends. Normally, in the adult business, when three porn stars knock on your hotel door, it's considered foreplay. \nWhen Trump's effusive greeting of Miss Drake did not lead to more snuggling, let alone the suggestion to preview some of her work on the hotel television, he offered her $10,000 to satisfy his suite dreams. \nDrake again demurred, saying that the next morning she needed to get back to Los Angeles ※for work.§ By that point in her career she had already notched screen credits for ※Extreme Doggie§ and ※Fornocopia.§ I would mention other titles, but as they say at the New York Post , ※This is a family newspaper.§ \nThat rejection prompted Donald to offer Jessica an early morning ride (of shame?) on his Trump airliner back to LA, which still didn't turn the trick. * * * \nThen last week, in the presence of her lawyer, Gloria Allred (the Perry Mason of many cases against Bill Cosby) Miss Drake tearfully repeated in primetime her shock and dismay that Mr. Trump had tried to take liberties with her reputation, which, after all, includes the 2009 Adult Video News Award for the ※Best Double Penetration Sex Scene§ in her classic work, ※Fallen.§ \nDrake said she was coming forward now to stand in ※solidarity§ with the other women Trump has manhandled, although there were suggestions that her outing was timed to coincide with the launch of Drake's new online store, where devoted viewers can purchase such classics as her ※Guide to BDSM for Beginners,§ among other titles. \nNormally scenes such as the one I am describing would be consigned to John Oliver, Monty Python, or Saturday Night Live , but in the new normal of presidential politics, even Miss Drake gets a respectful hearing on the issues. \nFor example, the next day the Huffington Post reported: ※Woman Says Trump Sexually Assaulted Her, Offered Her $10,000 For Sex.§ \nThe deadpan New York Times wrote: ※Ms. Drake, who appeared Saturday with the women's rights lawyer Gloria Allred, said Mr. Trump had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission.§ \nThe headline in New York Magazine read: ※Adult Actress Jessica Drake Details Trump Assault, Blasts Him for ＆Uncontrollable Misogyny'.§ \nLook, I have no doubt that Trump is a pig who routinely gropes and propositions women, but since when does the press in a presidential election have to source its stories in the ※adult§ industry? * * * \nSadly, the answer to this question dates to winter 1992 when Bill and Hillary Clinton figured out that unless a presidential candidate has a sexual storyline, few of the voters will pay much attention to their positions on nuclear disarmament or welfare reform. \nDuring the 1992 Super Bowl, the Clintons appeared on a halftime special of 60 Minutes to deny jointly (Bill: That allegation is false ) that he had ever had an affair with Gennifer Flowers, who lived in Little Rock, Arkansas when Bill was governor and often out jogging. \nIn this vaudeville performance, Hillary played the straight man, adding: ※You know, I'm not sitting here〞some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.§ (At least she didn't reference The Eagles.) \nOnly in 1998, under oath in a sworn deposition, did Bill admit to having a 12-year affair with Ms. Flowers. But neither her allegations in 1992, nor his lying about it, cost him the election that year. \nJust the opposite: Clinton's wanderlust might have won him sympathy among the voters (no strangers to sexual boredom) who found they had more in common with a soft-shell Baptist (Bill) than an uptight Protestant (George H.W. Bush). \nNor did Clinton's impeachment in 1998 for lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky under oath in the Paula Jones case hurt his post-presidential career (worth $200 million +) or the electoral prospects of his wife in 2016. \nBut it did turn sexuality into a mainstream presidential campaign issue, which is one of the reasons why this year's race seems only to be about sex. * * * \nNo doubt the Clintons do find some delicious irony in Trump's groping charges, as payback for what they view as the Republican use of sexuality to impeach Bill in 1998 and, in 2016, for the GOP plan to make his many adulterous affairs fair game for their campaign soundbites. (Cut to an online image of the White House and over it a fading picture of Bill smoking a cigar, with the caption ※Here we go again?§) \nWithout the pageant-loving, casino operating Donald Trump as the Republican nominee in 2016, Hillary Clinton could well have been vulnerable on the sexual front, with Bill's mistresses steady fodder for negatives ads and the many allegations from his scorned lovers that Hillary organized the slut-shaming. \nInstead of the 2016 election turning on Hillary's marriage to Hugh Hefner's doppelg?nger, the storyline that has played best in the media is Donald's secret life as a groper. \nThe press actually has given Trump a pass for his adultery (which produced all those wonderful children) but zeroed in on his groping, in part because he confessed to it on an NBC videotape and also because〞think of ratings〞gropers belong in the same basket of deplorables as child abusers and others lurking on subways, crowed elevators, or near schoolyards. \nBest of all for the Clintons, politically anyway, is that the charge of groping is impossible for Trump to refute. Even denying it sounds sleazy. \nAnd it colors all aspects of the campaign. To wit: the New York Times headline when at Gettysburg Trump outlined his vision for America: ※Donald Trump Pledges to ＆Heal Divisions' (and Sue His Accusers).§ * * * \nFor its mud-slinging, I am sure the Trump campaign has spent many long hours brainstorming how to tar Hillary as a lesbian. But even that innuendo has fallen flat, despite the rumor mongering that she's in a Boston marriage with her assistant Huma Abedin (whose husband, Anthony Weiner, is otherwise distracted in high school chat rooms). \nSeveral of Bill's former lovers (Sally Miller, Dolly Kyle, and Flowers) have tried to play up Bill's pillow talk that Hillary prefers the nighttime company of women. But none of these allegations have gone further than Infowars or the supermarket press. (※ Hillary Hit Man Tells All !§) \nNor have out-of-wedlock children, a staple of the 1884 campaign (as was chanted to Grover Cleveland: ※ Ma, Ma, Where ' s my pa ?§), gotten much play in this year's presidential race. \nTrump and his casino gumshoes have put considerable effort into tracking down the rumor that Danney Williams is Bill Clinton's illegitimate son by a Little Rock prostitute named Bobbie Ann Williams. \nTrump invited Danney (a sympathetic man) to the third presidential debate, as if to press on Bill a Scarlet Letter. Despite Williams looking very much like President Bill, the story got no more traction than did the news that Malik Obama, the president's shunned half-brother, is supporting Trump. He, too, got a debate invitation, to sit in the box presumably marked ※Shame.§ \nAlso in the dustbin of history are the allegations that Flowers aborted Bill's baby in 1977 and the whispering campaign (a great political standby when proof is elusive) that Chelsea is the product of an affair between Hillary and her then law firm colleague, Webb Hubbell. \nThe Williams and Hubbell stories come with some convincing Internet similarities, at least in the photographs, although in both cases politically, this rumor milling whiplashed against Trump, as voters have only equated such tawdry allegations with his Birther past, something that has stuck as campaign mud. * * * \nTechnically, Birtherism does't directly involve sex, although it lingers on its fringes, as it speaks to Barack Obama's illegitimacy, his foreign allegiances, and possibly disputed paternity, including the claim that Frank Marshall Davis was actually Obama's biological father (another subterranean creed of Trumpism). \nAgain, the documentary proof is a series of look-a-like photographs, as close as the Internet gets to DNA. That Davis was an American Communist works well in the campaign, as it suggests the origins of Obama's political genetic code. \nIronically, for all his efforts at smear, Trump came out the loser in the debates when Hillary nailed him to Birtherism, which has become a convenient code word for Trump's racism, misogyny, and intolerance of immigrants, especially muslims. \nNor, in response, did Trump have any luck in linking the Birther movement to Clinton's 2008 campaign, when, according to Donald, consigliere-journalist Sidney Blumenthal delighted in the suggestion that Barack was born in Kenya. \nInstead, the debate claim only made Trump look disingenuous. Clinton got a pass on what her campaign may or may not have insinuated in 2008. And at this point, no one cares. But voters do remember Trump as the Imperial Wizard of Birtherism. * * * \nRepublicans can only blame themselves for wanting to divide the electorate in 2016 along lines of sexual preference or deviance, although this strategy was based on Hillary being the Democratic nominee and anyone other than Trump standing for the Republicans. \nHad the GOP nominee been Carly Fiorina, Jeb Bush, or John Kasich, Clinton Inc. might well have been vulnerable to possible storylines about infidelity, illegitimacy, and rape. (Cue up the Paula Jones description of Bill, during a business meeting, exposing himself in a Little Rock hotel and settling her lawsuit for $850,000.) \nInstead, the Republicans went with the polyamorous Trump, who, in addition to three marriages, has bragged on morning radio about his success with young women and who since 1996 has been leering at Miss Universe contestants〞a bit like Austin Powers. ( Shall we shag now, or shall we shag later ?) \nWith Trump's resum of creepy perversion, you might have thought that the Republicans would drop sexual misconduct from the electoral playbook. Instead, they doubled down to make the case that both Clintons, if elected, would turn the White House into a strip club. \nNot only did the Clintons shrug off such innuendo, but, in response, they said (in effect), if they did, it would be to cater to the likes of players such as Donald J. Trump (leisure suit and open collar optional). * * * \nFor the moment〞and I can't see anything changing in the last days of the campaign〞the accepted wisdom of most front pages is that Donald Trump has groped as many women as Tiger Woods has watched pole dancing in Vegas. Even the gallery of ※their women§ looks about the same. \nConversely, few voters seem to care that Bill might have forced himself on several women or that Hillary helped to cover up his brutality. That's a narrative of the 1990s, which is perhaps the last time Austin Danger Trump read the newspaper. ( I've been frozen for 30 years. I've got to see if my bits and pieces are still working .) \nFor most voters in 2016, names such as Kathleen Willey or Juanita Broaddrick are as lost in time as Nan Britton, who just before the 1920 election bore a love child with then candidate Senator Warren Harding. \nBritton and the child got Republican hush money and a sad little house in Asbury Park, New Jersey. After Harding won, she was invited to the White House but their affair, so to speak, was kept in the closet. * * * \nIf you think about elections as political sitcoms, in 1960 the Kennedys had to run as Rob and Laura Petrie on The Dick Van Dyke Show , complete with twin beds, long flannel pajamas, and prudent kisses on the cheek to say good-night, even if The JFK Reality Show would make Trump, Bill Clinton, and Tiger look like apprentices at adultery. \nCome 2016, only something that resembles Modern Family and a desperate-housewives reality show can crack network primetime, and who better to put on air than The Clintons, with their Dallas -like money, communal sexuality, and more illicit storylines than CSI . \nFor more than twenty years, Bill and Hillary have been bringing us seasons of lust, affairs, ※I-did-not-have-sex-with-that-woman§, Vince Foster, Travelgate, foundation slush funds, basement servers, commodity trading, Whitewater, Bosnian snipers, pay-to-play, Benghazi, lost e-mails, and the like, and the ratings only continue to go up. \nSure, The Apprentice was fun for a few episodes, but the sameness of insulting young people grew tedious. How is that supposed to compete with Bill making a pass at Huma, while her husband goes to prison for airing his junk, and Chelsea finding out about her real father. Next on The Clintons ?",

    "text": "Email \nIn the US, the political system has now disgorged two candidates the citizenry cannot be less enthusiastic about. Driven by ambition more than a love of the people or a sincere desire to serve, one can be forgiven for wondering if they are just as trapped by their motivations as the public in its two-party myopia. No authentic leader among the two ＃ \nThese thoughts lead to the rage of my youth, existentialism, and to Jean-Paul Sartre, who died 36 years ago last April. More than 50,000 mourners lined the streets and packed Montparnasse cemetery at his funeral, many quite young 〞 improbable they would exhibit a similar interest in the successor philosophies, notably the current preoccupation with deconstruction, a focus on whether the written or spoken word is successful (or not) in clarity of meaning. \nDifficult as existentialism may be to pin down, there are a few necessary elements: the individual, free will as crucial to human existence, the subsequent responsibility for action that accompanies it, leading to an unavoidable anxiety as a consequence. The authentic life then is one chosen freely rather than imposed by society. No wonder it appealed to the young. \nWhat triggered this meandering into Sartre and his philosophy was Hillary Clinton's two-minute summing up at the end of the last debate. She attested to her lifelong concern (her latest claim) for improving the lives of children 〞 a phrase bringing to mind a balancing scale. One one side the improved lives of children in Arkansas and the benefits of subsidies to children in general, and on the other the deaths of hundreds of thousands in Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere 〞 the most vulnerable that is the old, the sick and the children bearing the brunt. Politicians are a breed apart, unconcerned with ＆responsibility' and undisturbed by Sartre's ＆anxiety'. \nNot so long ago there was another US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, who, when asked about the 576,000 children who had died (according to a UN report) as a result of the Iraq embargo, simply dismissed the question as a price to be paid to be rid of Saddam Hussein. The embargo failed in that regard, and when Saddam was removed by the successor US government's military intervention, it resulted in chaos and the birth of ISIS. \nThe Republican candidate, Donald Trump, is unique, in that responsibility washes over him and into the shower drain like a layer of dirt; he is devoid of it even in personal interaction. The only rational explanation of his behavior is the term ＆prolonged adolescence' used by professionals. \nHis basic issue over several decades has been bad deals 〞 bad deals in defending allies who he feels do not pay enough for their defense and bad trade deals. Trying to peel off some voters, Hillary Clinton in the last debate pointed out that he took out an ad in The New York Times opposing the right's iconic Ronald Reagan over it. Like any business owner or high level executive, he intends to issue orders expecting them to be carried out. Good luck! It might explain the absence of concrete policy. \nThe American public has been short changed into picking either the lesser of two evils, casting a protest vote with the minor left or right party, or just sitting this election out. \nSartre offered personal bliss in the few post-war years of hope and promise before America's fear of ideologies and overweening sense of power plunged us into successive wars punctuated with interludes of peace. The wars continue, bleeding the country of an estimated $5 trillion in the present cycle ＃ the death and destruction the worst since the Second World War.",

    "text": "Go ahead. Count the survivors. \nThe US Presidential election ended yesterday. \nLittle information has come out since I reported on the situation 20 or so hours ago. \nBoth sides have demanded James Comey release more information, and he hasn't even made a public statement. \nBut the situation is clear. \nHillary Clinton is now facing certain indictment. There is simply no way this investigation would have been reopened 11 days before the election if that were not the case. We must not let #CrookedHillary take her CRIMINAL SCHEME into the Oval Office. #DrainTheSwamp pic.twitter.com/GtPkj4xIz6 \n〞 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2016 \nNo one is going to vote for a Presidential candidate who may well be in prison a few weeks after she takes office. If they're continuing the investigation through November, she could well be locked-up before she has a chance to be sworn in. \nShe is now nonviable. I half expect that they will pull her before Monday. Well, maybe not half-expect. Quarter-expect, perhaps. I don't even know if they're allowed to pull her at this point. I think they would have to put in Kaine. \nSo far she's made only a three sentence comment on it, and her staff has said nothing but that the FBI needs to explain more. Basically, they appear to believe they still own the FBI. But if they did own the FBI right now, this wouldn't have happened. There's no way. \nThe most logical analysis I have seen is that the agents of the FBI were revolting because of Comey's criminal collusion, and they exerted some form of pressure on him. I'm not sure what form of pressure they would have that would carry more weight than the pressure Hillary has. \nBasically, we've witnessed Kek intervention. \nA lot of people were saying Trump was going to win no matter what, and I kept that face up on the site. But tbh fam, I was a bit worried. They are going to have all these illegals voting, which will make a difference. They're going to do bussing. etc. \nTrump could contest it, but his only real leverage would be to threaten a putsch. And though I love this idea, I'm not 100% sure it would have actually happened. \nBut now, none of that matters. \nBecause not even the kike media can continue portraying Hillary as a viable candidate. \nWe've won, brothers. \nAll of our hard work this year has paid off. \nAnd make no mistake  every meme you posted, every comments section you trolled  all of that is what made this happen. \nKek sent us Trump. Sent the crazy old bastard right down an elevator into our laps. \nAnd then he said ※DO IT FAGGOTS.§ \nAnd we did it. \nWe memed Jeb into a character of an obsessive cuckold weirdo. \nWe memed Ted Cruz into Lyin Ted Cruzman Sachs. \nWe memed Hillary into a freefall collapse of Hillary on 9/11. \nAnd now we've pulled-off the greatest meme of all time: \nThey're going to lock her up. \nTake a bow, brothers. \nThis is a small step for memes. But it is a giant leap for our agenda to secure a homeland for our people and a future for White children. \nI'm still a little bit in shock. \nThis joy that I feel  I cannot describe it. \nThere is actually a very decent chance that by November 9th, I will actually be tired of winning. \nIn Conclusion \nDear kikes: remember when I told you ※now is not the time for fear, that comes later?§ \nWell. \nThe night has never been darker and our enemies have never been closer. \nBut lo, the people rejoice, and they sing songs of gladness. \nFor The Don is rising. \nAnd soon, the swamp will be drained, and our enemies shall know justice. \nHail Victory.",

ANTHONY WEINER AND HUMA ABEDIN \nNote by LD : Huma Abedin is an American Muslim of Indo-Pakistani descent. Weiner is a disgraced Jewish politician who has been involved in a series of sex scandals. When Huma found out about her husband's sleazy sexual activities, she was forced to divorce him. This was in August 2016. The unlikely couple had been married for just over six years. \nAs for Huma, her relationship with Hillary Clinton has been an extraordinarily close one for almost 20 years, so much so that there have been sensational rumors of a lesbian liaison . The view for popular consumption is that Hillary is Huma's ※mentor§ and ※mother figure§. Hillary once compared Huma to her own daughter Chelsea. ※I have one daughter,§ she said. ※But if I had a second daughter, it would be Huma.§ Huma's real mother, noting that Hillary had now replaced her in her daughter's affections, once told Hillary jokingly, ※I'm jealous of you!§ (See here ) \nJohn Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono ( pictured ), claims to have had a lesbian affair with Hillary in the 1970s. ※We met many times,§ Yoko boasts, ※and became very intimate !§ (LD) \nTOM LEONARD continues : \nWeiner, a for-mer Demo-crat con-gress-man for New York, be-came em-broiled in a se-ries of scan-dals over ex-chang-ing sex-u-ally ex-plicit text mes-sages with a string of women. \nHe sep-a-rated from Miss Abe-din, vice chair-man of the Clin-ton cam-paign, in Au-gust. \nIt is un-der-stood the FBI is in-ves-ti-gat-ing Weiner af-ter it was re-vealed that he had been sex-ting a high school stu-dent who was 15 at the time.

    "text": "Posted on October 29, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn \nEarlier this week, on October 24, 2016, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford sent a fascinating piece of communication, titled ※ Upholding Our Oath ,§ to every member of the U.S. Armed Services. \nNote: General Joseph Dunford Jr. , 60, was the 36th Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. Nominated by Obama, Dunford became the 19th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on October 1, 2015. \nThis is what Gen. Dunford wrote : \n※As the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff＃as our country again prepares for a peaceful transfer of power to a new administration, I write to share my views regarding our mutual obligations as military professionals and rights as citizens during this election season. \nEvery service member swears ※to support and defend the Constitution of the United States§ and to ※bear true faith and allegiance to the same.§ This oath is embedded in our professional culture and underpins the values that shape and define our all-volunteer force. Beginning with General George Washington resigning his military commission, our deliberate and disciplined commitment to upholding the principle of civilian control of the military underpins not only our warrior ethos but also the expectations of how we conduct ourselves while in uniform. \nWhile we must always safeguard our professional integrity, extra vigilance is required during any political transition. Our individual and collective obligation during this election season is twofold. First, we must recognize that we have one Commander in Chief, and until authority is transferred on January 20, 2017, the Joint Force must remain clearly focused on and responsive to the existing National Command Authority. Second, the Joint Force must conduct itself in such a way that the new administration has confidence that it will be served by a professional, competent, and apolitical military. This is especially important in the context of delivering the best military advice. \nEvery member of the Joint Force has the right to exercise his or her civic duty, including learning and discussing?〞?even debating?〞?the policy issues driving the election cycle and voting for his or her candidate of choice. Provided that we follow the guidance and regulations governing individual political participation, we should be proud of our civic engagement. What we must collectively guard against is allowing our institution to become politicized , or even perceived as being politicized, by how we conduct ourselves during engagements with the media, the public, or in open or social forums. \nWe are living in the most volatile and complex security environment since World War II. Whether confronting violent extremist organizations seeking to destroy our way of life or dealing with state actors threatening international order, threats to our national security require a Joint Force that is ready, capable, and trusted. To that end, I have a duty to protect the integrity and political neutrality of our military profession. But this obligation is not mine alone. It belongs to every Soldier, Marine, Sailor, Airman, and Coastguardsman. Thank you for joining me in honoring our history, our traditions, and the institutions of the U.S. Armed Forces by upholding the principle of political neutrality .§ \nEven without reading between the lines, General Dunford clearly has concerns about politicization of the military and its obligation and commitment to political neutrality and noninterference in politics. That the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff must remind members of the Armed Forces that they must ※uphold§ their oath both suggests and implies that the opposite is going on, i.e., the military is politicized and there are fears that it will intervene in civilian politics. \nIf this pic (below) of a young U.S. Marine is any indication, Gen. Dunford has good reasons to issue the ※Upholding Our Oath§ communication. \nA year ago, a Rasmussen Reports national survey of active and retired military personnel found that only 15% had a favorable opinion of Hillary Clinton, with just 3% who viewed her very favorably. A staggering 81% had an unfavorable opinion of her , including 69% who had a very unfavorable view of her. \nA similar survey today is sure to find even higher unfavorable ratings for Hillary among those whom she would command as their Commander in Chief. \nH/t GiGi and TruthFeedNews",

Griffee / November 2, 2016 / DML REPORT / With only 6 days left before election day, Dennis Michael Lynch takes an electoral college map and shows how additional states will turn RED and get Trump over 270 electoral college votes to WIN the presidency. \nTaking states that the media has tried to downplay as if Trump has no chance to win them, DML shows how Trump not only has a chance, but predicts he WILL WIN these states, and he backs up his prediction with solid data and facts. \nDML also clarified that the polls are extremely misleading. He said Trump has lit a spark in people who have not voted in decades  some who have never voted  but now they are embracing Trump. These people are not being included in the polls. \nEarly voting is also not a true representation of what's about to happen, because more Democrats tend to show up for early voting, while the majority of Republicans wait until election day. \nWATCH THIS EYE-OPENING VIDEO for a critical state-by-state analysis that proves Trump can easily win the election  then SHARE IT EVERYWHERE! \n**Note: In the video when DML talks about PA voting for Trump, he forgot to mention 100k Democrats in PA switched parties over the past year. In addition, PA saw an eye-popping number of new voters register as Republicans. Combined, PA in this election has 240,000 more Republicans than it did in 2012. \nSign up to get alerts about Dennis Michael Lynch's upcoming Donald Trump film and breaking news. Subscribe",

    "text": "Home / News / The African voters in the US who want Donald Trump as their president The African voters in the US who want Donald Trump as their president fisher 1 min ago News Comments Off on The African voters in the US who want Donald Trump as their president The African voters in the US who want Donald Trump as their president In less than 48 hours, Americans will go to the polls to elect a new president. But no matter what happens on election day (Nov. 8), Trump will not win the majority of the black vote. Many of them are expected to heed the message of president Obama who has warned that the Republican candidate will undo his administration's legacy. But Trump 's message〞to make America great again〞might still draw an unlikely group of supporters from within the black community: African immigrants. Foreign-born Africans make up a small share of the US immigrant population, but their numbers have been doubling every decade since 1970. African immigrants living in the US grew from 80,000 in 1970 to 1.8 million as of 2013, according to a study from the Pew Research Center. This group of voters say they are supporting Trump because of a blend of ideals that his candidacy represents: as the new flag bearer for conservative, traditional politics; a political outsider who has chipped away at political correctness; a successful businessman who has consistently reinvented himself to achieve the American dream; and a man sure to deliver them from what they see as the disappointing presidency of Barack Obama . Despite Trump 's anti-immigrant rhetoric, some African immigrants have been dissatisfied with Obama 's middling Africa policy and think real change from an outsider like themselves could make a positive difference for America their own fortunes. Leading this pack is none other than president Obama 's Kenyan half-brother, Malik. The 58-year-old naturalized US citizen, has spoken about his own brother's leadership as ※deep disappointment,§ and said that Trump was ※providing something new and something fresh§ to the American people. Some of the African Trump supporters like Malik have also voiced their concerns about the moral relativism that has pervaded US politics, from abortion rights to marriage equality, to the current debate on transgender bathroom use. I tried to co-exist with my brother Barack Obama but he shut me out; In his Ivory Tower. I gave up. 〞 Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) November 5, 2016 VOTE FOR MR. TRUMP ! Malik already voted. 〞 Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) November 5, 2016 Reno Omokri, once the controversial new media aide to Nigeria's former president, Goodluck Jonathan, is now a pastor in the San Francisco Bay area. Speaking to the BBC, Omokri said that he supports Trump because he was going to nominate a Supreme Court judge who might reverse, or deal, with these issues from a conservative standpoint. ※Those issues, they might seem small to you,§ Omokri said, but they ※are very important to someone like me because I am a conservative and that is why I am supporting Donald Trump .§ Khadra Abdirahman is a 24-year-old Somali-American who was born in New York after her parents fled the civil war in Somalia. But as a registered Republican and a first-time voter, she intends to cast her ballot for a political candidate who is against the status quo. Establishment party leaders she said, are oblivious to the populism born out of frustration, which is why she would vote for a candidate like Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders, instead of Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush. Abdirahman, who didn't support Obama when he ran in 2008 and 2012, thinks the 2016 elections are ※a change election§ and a ※revolutionary election.§ She says the ※surge of anti-establishment, anti-globalist political revolutions,§ the like we have seen with Brexit, should provide the space for candidates like Trump to be elected. ※America projects a false image of goodness and truthfulness and it is actually extremely rotten to the core.§ Sign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief 〞 the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.",

El PSOE ha aupado su candidatura pese a tener un perfil poco conocido por los espa?oles. Muchos ignoran, por ejemplo, que este individuo ha sido presidente del Ejecutivo durante los ltimos cuatro a?os. Aqu est todo lo que necesitas saber sobre nuestro prximo presidente. \nNombre : Su nombre es Mariano Rajoy, aunque en Pontevedra, donde se cri, se le conoce tambin como ＆El rompehuesos de Pontevedra', ＆El Martillo' o ＆El trumpito guasn'. \nEsposa : No. \nPartido poltico : Partido Popular, PSOE, Ciudadanos, Converg豕ncia i Uni, Asociacin de Lucha Canaria Pontevedra. \nMsica : ＆Mi gran noche' de Raphael. \nNacimiento : Pese a que l mismo considera que su tierra natal es Pontevedra, naci en Albania en 1467. \nFamilia : Se cree que tiene cinco hijos que se llaman Amanda, Kevin, Se?or Jos, Alejandro y El Beb. Su perfil familiar ha sido del agrado de los grandes partidos espa?oles, motivo por el que se crey que su candidatura podra llegar a buen puerto. Su hijo mayor, Kevin, es animador del videojuego EA Sports. \nSegn ciertos rumores, tiene un primo que es Premio Nobel de Fsica. \nHabilidades : Sabe pilotar helicpteros. \nTwitter : Es un tuitero activo en @marianokrystal. \nMayor miedo : Los hombres atractivos y seguros de s mismos. \nProfesin : Ocupa el cargo de registrador de la propiedad en Santa Pola. Segn dicen los que le conocen, este cargo para l es mucho ms que una aficin. Lo considera su autntica profesin y saca adelante las tareas de presidencia durante la hora de la comida o los fines de semana. \nEslogan de campa?a : ＆Tsh, tsh, espera＃ dnde vas＃ a ver＃ espera. No＃ bueno, djame a m. No, ahora no. T djalo y yo, cuando eso, pues ya＃ Vale, como quieras, yo qu s'. \nControversias : Esparci hilillos de plastilina por toda la costa gallega.

    "text": "Donald Trump, el primer presidente naranja de los Estados Unidos EL MAGNATE ASEGURA QUE SEGUIR LUCHANDO POR LA IGUALDAD DE LA COMUNIDAD NARANJOAMERICANA racismo \nDonald Trump hizo historia el martes al convertirse en el primer presidente naranja de Estados Unidos, con una rotunda victoria sobre Hillary Clinton impulsada por un mensaje de renovacin poltica y social. \nEl candidato republicano, de 70 a?os, hijo de una mujer blanca de Kansas y de un padre naranja del Condado de Orange (California), prometi una nueva era de cambio y esperanza. Muchos de sus partidarios, como el reverendo naranja Jack Jessenson, dejaron caer lgrimas de color zanahoria por sus mejillas melocotonadas. \nTrump cruz una puerta abierta hace 153 a?os, cuando Abraham Lincoln concedi la libertad a los esclavos naranjas en medio de una sangrienta guerra civil. El magnate asumir la presidencia el 20 de enero, 51 a?os despus de que se sancionara una ley que impeda votar a la poblacin naranjoamericana en muchos estados sure?os. \nEl 45o presidente estadounidense ha afirmado que luchar por los derechos de los ciudadanos naranjas. ※Racismo, no nos hemos curado de ello§, dijo en un programa de radio. ※An es comn escuchar en la calle expresiones ＆orangger' (＆naranjucho', en espa?ol) con total impunidad§, constat. Trump admite que ha habido cierto progreso en temas raciales, si comparamos la situacin a la vivida por la comunidad naranja en la dcada de los 50 y los 60. \nEn su libro ※Dreams of my orange father§, el magnate ya trat el tema del antinaranjismo. ※Me cri en un barrio eminentemente naranjoamericano. Un barrio calabaza, que le dicen los polticamente correctos. Los blancos no solan venir, y cuando lo hacan era para insultarnos diciendo ＆aqu huele a caqui'§, escriba en el prlogo, donde tambin aprovech para desmentir el rumor de su pertenencia al grupo violento Orange Panthers. \nLa fecha de investidura de Trump, programada para el 20 de enero, no es casual. Ese mismo da se conmemoran 50 a?os exactos desde que la polica cargara contra unos manifestantes naranjas con gran virulencia, episodio que pas a la historia como el Carrot Sunday (Domingo zanahorio).",

Call it a window of vulnerability. \nNo matter whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins on Tuesday, Barack Obama bequeaths a world fraught with danger. From Asia to the Middle East and eastern Europe, governments and forces hostile to US and the west may try to exploit America's power vacuum. \nThe problem is not new. Unlike in Britain, the US constitution does not allow a quick handover. Clinton or Trump will be sworn in at noon on 20 January 2017. Until then Obama remains in office, but as a ※lame duck§ president his wishes are increasingly irrelevant. \nOnce installed, it can still take months for the new incumbent to establish his or her authority and complete thousands of appointments. The most important, such as national security adviser and the secretaries of defence and state, must be confirmed by Congress. This can be a contentious, lengthy process.",

But your influence on the American community at large has been profound.

    "title": "FBI Director Comey Asks President Putin: ※Is Anthony Weiner Yours?§",
    "text": "An absolutely astonishing Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today details an extended telephonic conversation held Thursday between President Putin and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey wherein America's top law enforcement officer asked Russia's leader ※Is Anthony Weiner yours?§, to which Putin replied, ※You should ask Aleksandr Poteyev§〞and that led, less than 24 hours after this call ended, to Hillary Clinton being placed, once again, under FBI investigation. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\nAccording to this report, Director Comey's call to President Putin was in regards to the Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) this past Tuesday advising all Federation security and intelligence organizations to cease all contact and cooperation with the FBI〞and that we detailed in our report titled Russia Breaks All Contact With Hillary Clinton's ※Ministry Of Terror§〞Once Called The FBI.\nWith ※many/numerous§ joint terrorism and international criminal investigations currently ongoing between FIS agencies and the FBI, this report continues, Director Comey expressed his concerns to President Putin that the ending of them ※would/could§ cause ※dangers/alarms§ to both the Federation and United States〞to which President Putin agreed, and in a bid to ease Russian-US war tensions publically stated after this call ended that ※Russia is not going to attack anyone, that's ridiculous§.\nThough not the ※main/central§ focus of their conversation, this report notes, President Putin did become ※annoyed/perturbed§ when Director Comey asked him about former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (aka Carlos Danger) while seeming to allege that he was in some way a Russian spy〞and that President Putin bluntly replied to by reminding Director Comey that the correct person to ask that question to was former Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) officer Aleksandr Poteyev, whose location could be found by asking the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\nSVR officer Poteyev, this report details, was the ※overseer/director§ of a Federation ※honeypot§ intelligence operation operating in the United States whose mission was to ※discover/unmask§ high ranking American elite politicians, bankers, businessmen, etc., preying upon young Russian girls brought to that country to perform pedophile sex acts.\nOnce these sexually deviant elite Americans who preyed upon these young Russian girl children were identified by the SVR, this report explains, they were put under electronic surveillance〞and once being notified of this, many of them volunteered to assist the Federation in ※other meaningful ways§.\nThis highly successful SVR operation was, however, destroyed, this report continues, when SVR officer Poteyev turned against the Federation and became an operative for the American CIA〞who this past July, immediately after FBI Director Comey announced Hillary Clinton would face no charges for her crimes, was suddenly declared dead (without any evidence) by the CIA, but that the SVR knows is not the truth.\nMaster SVR intelligence officer Anna Kushchyenko (in the US known as Anna Chapman) just prior to her and other SVR ※operatives/specialists§ being betrayed to the CIA by Poteyev, this report continues, had identified US Congressman Anthony Weiner as being a pedophile and targeted him for ※extreme/radical§ electronic surveillance〞but whose mission was ended on 27 June 2010 with her arrest by US authorities.\nThe SVR's ※extreme/radical§ electronic surveillance of Congressman Weiner was justified, this report explains, due not only to his being a sexual deviant, but, also, because his wife, Huma Abedin, was the top aide to then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton〞whom the Federation has long noted is an ※existential threat§ to the entire world.\nThis report doesn't mention in its unclassified portions if the SVR continued their electronic surveillance of Congressman Weiner, but does allude to the CIA picking up this investigation where intelligence officer Anna Kushchyenko left off〞and as evidenced by the CIA's outing him as a sexual deviant 11 months later in May 2011.\nTo why the CIA turned the SVR's Congressman Weiner surveillance operation against Hillary Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin, this report further notes, was due to Secretary Clinton, in 2011, ordering the killing of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi (and the destruction of Libya)〞who was a major CIA asset and had allowed, since 2004, this US spy agency to use his country to interrogate (actually torture) high value Islamic terror leaders.\nWithin 24 hours of President Putin directing FBI Director Comey to look for answers about Congressman Weiner's association with Russia by asking Aleksandr Poteyev (really the CIA), this report continues, Director Comey notified the US Congress that his investigation into Hillary Clinton was being re-opened〞and was due to the ※mysterious/magical§ appearance of tens-of-thousands of secret Hillary Clinton emails discovered on the computer of former Congressman Weiner, and that led Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein to state that a ※real bombshell§ had been discovered otherwise the FBI wouldn't have dared begin this whole sordid process again.\nTo how the Obama regimes FBI, CIA and Department of Justice (DoJ) will untangle the Hillary Clinton catastrophe they've ensnared themselves, and the American people, into this report doesn't even venture an opinion on〞but it does conclude by noting that the chaos enveloping America right now includes not only their presidential election, but Attorney General Loretta Lynch stunningly pleading the 5th Amendment in a letter to the US Congress this week over the payment of $1 billion in cash to Iran, and a terrifying new US Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure set to go into effect on 1 December that will legalize the ability of the US government to hack into computers in any jurisdiction, even in foreign nations.\nLeading any ordinary American, one would think, to ask of themselves the same thing Donald Trump has been asking: ※Why not vote for me, what the hell do you have to lose?§〞after all, with Hillary Clinton having already been caught on tape talking about rigging one election, whose to say she isn't about to do it again?",

    "text": "A very sobering Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that the Federation has been officially notified by the United States North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) that their military forces are now on ※ Sustained Alert Status § due to unspecified threats directly related to their upcoming 8 November presidential election. [ Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\nAccording to this report, under the protocol and procedures outlined in the New Start Treaty that came into force on 5 February 2011 between the Federation and the United States, one of the obligations of the signing parties to reduce the risk of war is a notification process to take place when ※ aberrations/sudden changes § (departure from normal) are made〞and that occurred this past week when NORAD unexpectedly expanded its 17-21 October air defense exercises with Canada to now include the California region where just yesterday US warplanes conducted what they call ※ security exercises §.\nAs to the American's ※ explanation/reasons § for expanding the use of their warplanes over the continental United States (CONUS) with no foreign threat being known, this report explains, the Pentagon explained as being a ※ National Special Security Event § due to unspecified threats being posed to the national leadership of the US government and directly related to their presidential election.\nDeputy Defense Minister Tatiana Shevtsova , however, and shockingly, writes in this report that the American government is currently undergoing a ※ silent coup § pitting forces loyal to President Obama against those aligned with Hillary Clinton〞who was the former disgraced US Secretary of State and is facing an estimated 20 year prison sentence for obstruction justice and who, also, is being ※ closed in upon § by Obama's Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) who have launched a staggering 5 different criminal investigations against her and everyone of her inner circle .\nDeputy Minister Shevtsova further notes in this MoD report that the vast criminality of Hillary Clinton, and everyone associated with her, has been so exposed to the American public that President Obama's greatest fear now is that even if she were able to be elected, she could singlehandedly destroy the Democratic Party for decades to come〞an observation, curiously, supported by American experts who believe the same .\nEqually to be as feared by the Obama regime as Hillary Clinton, this report continues, is her campaign chairman John Podesta who is described as being adept at earning extraordinary sums of money via selling out the American public , and who Wikileaks revealed yesterday gave the order to destroy all of Hillary Clinton's emails that were under subpoena by the US Congress and that a US Federal Judge had, likewise, ordered to be returned to the US State Department.\nWith London's Guardian News Service having gone through all of Podesta's Wikileaks released emails , this report notes, even this far-leftist publication has been appalled at the level of corruption of Hillary Clinton and all who surround her〞and who wrote yesterday that the level of criminality surrounding Hillary Clinton ※ points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else §.\nAs the six biggest US-based corporations supporting Hillary Clinton control some 90% of tens of thousands media outlets, including television channels, newspapers, magazines, radio stations and online editions (which means that the US media market is monopolized to a great extent and alternative outlets cannot be accessed in many towns), this report continues, the American people have awoken to the fact that their nation has fallen to 41 st out of 180 countries in the latest Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index to both their shame and amazement of what their criminal elites have done to them.\nAnd in the American peoples ※ response/reaction § to the horrors that their Hillary Clinton supporting criminal elite class has put them through, this report notes, they are even now massively rejecting the manipulation of polling data designed to keep them from voting 〞and have, also, reacted in horror to YouTube, yesterday, censoring a Wall Street Journal video telling these people how they are being lied to and deceived.\nWith more empirical evidence showing Donald Trump is poised to win next weeks US presidential election in a landslide , and the Obama regime itself now turning against Hillary Clinton , this report grimly concludes, anyone believing that Hillary Clinton and her desperate criminal forces won't strike back to retake control of America would be gravely mistaken〞and the worst may be yet to come.",

    "text": "With fake polls running rampant everywhere, with Reuters/Ipsos just releasing yet another fake poll oversampling Democrats by 11% and including only ※Likely Voters§, then showing the results with Hillary Clinton leading by 6%, we have decided to conduct our own poll.\nOur poll is a fair and unbiased poll. We have included Twitter hashtags for #DonaldTrump and #HillaryClinton as well as #GaryJohnson and #JillStein. It will reach both sides, thus being fully fair and balanced. Our poll also includes 3rd party candidates Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Voters can only vote once in our poll and their vote cannot be changed.\nThanks to Wikileaks email ID 26551 we now have confirmed data of what we all have long suspected, that polling agencies are being ordered to oversample as much as needed in order to artificially inflate the numbers of a specific candidates which has enough power to pull the strings or is simply preferred by the polling agency.\nMost mainstream media polls only include ※Likely Voters§ nowadays though it hasn't always been like this. According to their definition, Likely Voters means people who also voted in the previous elections. This is not an accurate way to measure the real preference out there because both Trump and Clinton benefit from what is known as first time voters. People who never voted before, people who feel disenfranchised by the system and who simply didn't want to vote before.\nThere is also the Millennial vote which is also impossible to include in the Likely Voters BS the media is pushing. Donald Trump is a revolutionary who vowed to change the system. This has brought millions of new people who never participated in the elections before. Bernie Sanders was also a revolutionary who vowed to do the exact same thing. Bernie lost or better said the election was stolen from him but that's another story. Bernie endorsed Hillary Clinton so, some of his voters have been transferred to Hillary Clinton now. Those first-time Bernie voters are also not included in the Likely Voters polls.\nSo without further due, we present to you our own OPEN POLL where everybody can vote only once. A fair an unbiased poll.\nWho will you vote for in the upcoming US presidential election 2016? Note: There is a poll embedded within this post, please visit the site to participate in this post's poll.",

    "text": "Posted on October 28, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 3 Comments \nFour days ago, on October 24, 2016, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford sent a fascinating piece of communication, titled ※ Upholding Our Oath ,§ to every member of the U.S. Armed Services. \nNote: General Joseph Dunford Jr. , 60, was the 36th Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. Nominated by Obama, Dunford became the 19th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on October 1, 2015. \nThis is what Gen. Dunford wrote : \n※As the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff＃as our country again prepares for a peaceful transfer of power to a new administration, I write to share my views regarding our mutual obligations as military professionals and rights as citizens during this election season. \nEvery service member swears ※to support and defend the Constitution of the United States§ and to ※bear true faith and allegiance to the same.§ This oath is embedded in our professional culture and underpins the values that shape and define our all-volunteer force. Beginning with General George Washington resigning his military commission, our deliberate and disciplined commitment to upholding the principle of civilian control of the military underpins not only our warrior ethos but also the expectations of how we conduct ourselves while in uniform. \nWhile we must always safeguard our professional integrity, extra vigilance is required during any political transition. Our individual and collective obligation during this election season is twofold. First, we must recognize that we have one Commander in Chief, and until authority is transferred on January 20, 2017, the Joint Force must remain clearly focused on and responsive to the existing National Command Authority. Second, the Joint Force must conduct itself in such a way that the new administration has confidence that it will be served by a professional, competent, and apolitical military. This is especially important in the context of delivering the best military advice. \nEvery member of the Joint Force has the right to exercise his or her civic duty, including learning and discussing?〞?even debating?〞?the policy issues driving the election cycle and voting for his or her candidate of choice. Provided that we follow the guidance and regulations governing individual political participation, we should be proud of our civic engagement. What we must collectively guard against is allowing our institution to become politicized , or even perceived as being politicized, by how we conduct ourselves during engagements with the media, the public, or in open or social forums. \nWe are living in the most volatile and complex security environment since World War II. Whether confronting violent extremist organizations seeking to destroy our way of life or dealing with state actors threatening international order, threats to our national security require a Joint Force that is ready, capable, and trusted. To that end, I have a duty to protect the integrity and political neutrality of our military profession. But this obligation is not mine alone. It belongs to every Soldier, Marine, Sailor, Airman, and Coastguardsman. Thank you for joining me in honoring our history, our traditions, and the institutions of the U.S. Armed Forces by upholding the principle of political neutrality .§ \nEven without reading between the lines, General Dunford clearly has concerns about politicization of the military and its obligation and commitment to political neutrality and noninterference in politics. That the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff must remind members of the Armed Forces that they must ※uphold§ their oath both suggests and implies that the opposite is going on, i.e., the military is politicized and there are fears that it will intervene in civilian politics. \nIf this pic (below) of a young U.S. Marine is any indication, Gen. Dunford has good reasons to issue the ※Upholding Our Oath§ communication. \nA year ago, a Rasmussen Reports national survey of active and retired military personnel found that only 15% had a favorable opinion of Hillary Clinton, with just 3% who viewed her very favorably. A staggering 81% had an unfavorable opinion of her , including 69% who had a very unfavorable view of her. \nA similar survey today is sure to find even higher unfavorable ratings for Hillary among those whom she would command as their Commander in Chief. \nH/t GiGi and TruthFeedNews",

Clue No. 1 \nRemember that Newsweek cover of May 21, 2012, proclaiming Obama to be ※The First Gay President§? \nNewsweek ＆s orgasmic cover was prompted by Obama's reversal of the military's long-standing ※don't ask don't tell§ policy and his open support of ※gay marriage.§ \nThe weekly magazine's accompanying cover story was written by the political pundit Andrew Sullivan, a public (i.e., outed) homosexual who wrote that Obama's support of gay marriage had brought him to tears. (Lest you get all misty-eyed sentimental, he's the same Andrew Sullivan who once said ※gay marriage§ does NOT mean monogamy. As he put it oh so delicately : ※there is more likely to be greater understanding of the need for extramarital outlets between two men than between a man and a woman.§) \nAt the time, we the sheeple thought Newsweek didn't literally mean Obama is ※the first gay president§. \nThink again. \nHomosexuals pride themselves on their gaydar. They have to, in order to find each other because homosexuals constitute only 3% of the U.S. population, according to the Williams Institute , UCLA's LGBT research think tank. That means Andrew Sullivan already knew Barack Hussein Obama is a homosexual, just as another public homosexual 〞 conservative blogger Kevin Dujan of HillBuzz 〞 has known all along. Clue No. 2 \n7 months after the Newsweek cover, Candy 〞 the first transexual style magazine 〞 caused a brief publicity stir when it chose for its cover a transgender model, Connie Fleming, bearing a decided resemblance to Michelle Obama. (See DCG's post about this here .) \nIn the words of Daily Mail : ※A striking transgender model made up to look like Michelle Obama being sworn into office has been put on the front cover of a U.S. magazine＃. Fleming is dressed in typical First Lady fashion, down to the pearl necklace. Even the hair style is reminiscent of President Barack Obama's wife, Michelle. § \nFor Candy to do a cover story on a transgender U.S. president is bold enough, why pick a BLACK male-to-female transgender for its cover? And not just any black MtF transgender but one who resembles Michelle? Then have the model wear a wig just like Michelle's and a sleeveless dress just like Michelle's, exposing Fleming's toned muscular arms, of which Michael Obama is so proud and for which he is celebrated by all the Obama idolators in the MSM? Clue No. 3 \nFast forward 1? years to Time magazine's cover of June 9, 2014, proclaiming that we're at a ※Transgender Tipping Point: America's Next Civil Rights Frontier.§ (See my post, ※ Transgender surgery now covered by bankrupt Medicare ※.) \nFor its cover picture, Time could have chosen any number of transgenders 〞 male-to-female or female-to-male; white, black, yellow, brown. \nBut the magazine chose a BLACK male-to-female transgender, an obscure actor named Laverne Cox who also bears an uncanny resemblance to Michelle Obama. As observant FOTM commenter motherbarbarian noted: ※Looking at that Time cover photo, I am reminded of Michael Obama. Same sculpted arms and muscled legs.§ \nWink, wink. Nudge, nudge. \nFriends, we've been played. \n※We all know.§ They all know. \nJoan Rivers, Andrew Sullivan, Newsweek , Candy , Time , and all the denizens of the ※liberal§ media and Hollywood have known all along. \nSee our posts:",

    "title": "Comment on Predetermined vote counts show Nov. 8 presidential election is rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton by Anonymous",
    "text": "Dr. Eowyn | 2 Comments WARNING: \nThis post may be the most important post you'll read on not just the 2016 election, but the entire electoral system that legitimates the U.S. republic of representative democracy. The post is long, with multiple sections, so pace yourself accordingly. I suggest you bookmark this webpage so that you can return to read or re-read. ? \nJim Stone first posted about this two days ago on Nov. 1, 2016. \nUnsure about Stone, who calls himself an ※independent journalist§ (based in Japan) and who writes in a less-than-clear or reader-friendly manner, I refrained from writing about his post. \nThen InfoWars picked this issue up a day later on November 2. \nWhat is claimed is that a hidden web site of NBC affiliate WRCBtv in Chattanooga, Tenn., shows pre-determined final vote counts for an election that hasn't yet occurred 〞 the 2016 presidential election scheduled for November 8. \nBelow is a screenshot Jim Stone took of the election results on WRCBtv's hidden webpage, showing Hillary Clinton winning with 343 electoral votes and 42% of the popular vote . As Stone puts it: ※SCAM ELECTION ALREADY CONFIRMED. TRUMP LOSES.§ \nStone and InfoWars say the predetermined election results are provided by Worldnow.com. \nSo what is WorldNow? \nThis is what Wikipedia says, with a lot of jargon: \n※WorldNow is a New York-based software company . . . [that] offers the only integrated media platform enabling broadcasters, operators and media companies to easily create, acquire, manage, analyze, monetize and distribute media assets (text, images and videos) across all digital platforms and on-air systems in a unified, end-to-end workflow . . . . Worldnow's customers include CBS, COX, Dispatch, Fox Television, Meredith Corporation, Media General and Raycom Media . . . . On July 29, 2015, WorldNow announced its sale to Frankly, a San Francisco-based provider of white label social media services and mobile messaging apps . . . . In 2012, Fox Television Stations migrated its websites to WorldNow's platform . . . becoming WorldNow's second largest client (as of 2015, they have since switched to Lakana). In 2011, Meredith Corporation . . . began a four-year contract with WorldNow to operate its station websites. In January 2013, Media General reached a deal to move its eighteen stations to WorldNow, beginning with WFLA-TV.§ \nA ※media platform§ is a ※platform,§ medium or means of communicating news, such as a newspaper, TV station, Facebook , Twitter , or even a blog like FOTM . \nI typed ※worldnow.com§ in the URL bar of my laptop, but was brought to the webpage of Frankly Inc. with this URL: http://franklyinc.com/ . \nFrankly's ※About§ page says: \nWorldNow , the original broadcast arm of Frankly, was founded in 1999. We now serve over 200 stations across the United States as a true partner, offering customization services and strategic trainings on industry best practices for user engagement and monetization. \nFrankly's ※Investors§ page says: \n※ Our customers include NBC, ABC, CBS and FOX affiliates , as well as top fashion brands, professional sports franchises and global organizations.§ \nIn other words, WorldNow is a media software company that provides real-time data  such as election results  to local TV news stations like WRCBtv . \nYou can verify this for yourself by going on WRCBtv's website: http://www.wrcbtv.com/ . Scroll down to the bottom of WRCBtv's webpage, and you'll see this in the bottom left of the webpage: \nWRCBtv.com is ※powered by frankly§ and Frankly is the owner of WorldNow. In other words, WorldNow provides the content or the news for WRCBtv.com. \nStone claims that for now, WRCBtv.com's (predetermined) election results page is hidden, awaiting WorldNow to publicly post the (fake) election results sometime in the evening of November 8, Election Day. \nI can verify that the webpage is currently hidden. Here's what I did: I typed ※ftpcontent2.worldnow.com/wrcb/elections/elections.html§in the URL bar, but was brought to a McAfee Web Advisor page warning of ※Trouble ahead§ and asking me§Are you sure you want to go there?§ I then did a Yahoo search for ※WRCBtv.com decision 2016§. My search's results page has this at the top: \nNote that it says ※Decision 2016: Complete Election Results Posted§. I clicked the blue-colored ※ DECISION 2016: Complete Election Results § and was brought to this page of WRCBtv.com with the message: Our Apologies \nThe page you requested is currently unavailable. Pages on this site are constantly being revised, updated, and occasionally removed. You may have followed an outdated link or have outdated pages in your browser cache. Here's a screenshot I took: \nSo how did WorldNow come up with its predetermined final vote counts for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ? \nAnswer : A method called ※ fractional vote ※. \nTo begin, a fractional vote feature is embedded in the GEMS election management system of electronic voting machines , which counts approximately 25% of all votes in the United States. \nAs explained by Gun&Game , the fractional vote feature can be used to invisibly, yet radically, alter election outcomes by pre-setting desired vote percentages for the candidates. The tampering can be applied across large jurisdictions in less than 60 seconds; is not visible to election observers, even if they are standing in the room and watching the computer; and is unlikely to be detected by auditing or canvass procedures. \nGEMS vote-counting systems operate under five trade names: Global Election Systems, Diebold Election Systems, Premier Election Systems, Dominion Voting Systems, and Election Systems & Software, in addition to a number of private regional subcontractors. GEMS is used statewide in Alaska, Connecticut, Georgia, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Utah and Vermont, and for counties in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. It is also used in Canada. \nVote-rigging by electronic voting machines is real. \nA 2006 Emmy-nominated HBO documentary, Hacking Democracy , investigates the flawed integrity of electronic voting machines, particularly those made by Diebold Election Systems (now Global Election Systems), and exposes previously unknown backdoors in the Diebold trade secret computer software. Hacking Democracy documents American citizens investigating anomalies and irregularities with electronic voting systems during the 2000 and 2004 elections, especially in Volusia County, Florida. The film culminates in the on-camera hacking of the Diebold election system in Leon County, Florida 〞 the same computer voting system which has been used in elections across 39 states, and which still counts tens of millions of America's votes today. \nSo what is fractional or fractionalized vote? \nFractional vote is a method to distort the results of an election by ※weighting§ the votes. Instead of the principle of ※one person-one vote,§ some votes are counted not as 1, but as a fraction of or less than 1 (e.g., ? or ?), or as more than 1 (e.g., 1? or 1?). The distortion of ※one person-one vote§ is in order to achieve a pre-assigned percentage of votes for each candidate. For example, Candidate A is pre-assigned 51% of the votes, Candidate B 44%, and Candidate C gets the rest 〞 5%. \nAn algorithm is used to arrive at the pre-assigned percentages by changing the numbers automatically as the voting progresses. Although Candidate A in actuality received fewer number of votes than Candidate B, by ※weighting§ Candidate A's votes, those votes are distorted in value, with one vote being counted, say, 25 times, so that Candidate A is the winner. And although Candidate B actually received more votes than Candidate A, Candidate B's votes are ※weighted§ such that their values are less, with some votes converted to zero. The end result is that Candidate B loses. \nAccording to Jim Stone, below are the numerical votes and percentages that are the pre-assigned presidential election results for the various states , which are already on the ※Election Results§ webpage of WMCtv.com, a local TV station in Memphis, TN. (But if you go onto that webpage 〞 http://ftpcontent4.worldnow.com/wmctv/elections/wmc-electionresults.html 〞 now, all the values are 0): \nLine 119: US President Alabama Line 121: Donald Trump (R)

of election results on November 8, Jim Stone says that he'd ※ripped the code out worldnow.com/kfvs12/elections.html§ and can confirm ※there is no active in it to need testing,\" i.e., \"the page has no code that will tabulate votes.\" The data on the hidden page are not codes, but are \"all just typed in.\" \nThere is another way to demonstrate vote rigging of the 2016 election -- a webpage on election results of KFVS12 , a local TV station in Cape Girardeau, MO: http://82.221.129.208/ftpcontent4worldnowcomkfvs12elections.html . \nThe webpage at present is a fakery in progress , with the final (fake) vote counts for some races already filled in, but blank for some other races. This afternoon, November 3, 2016, I took screenshots of every race with (fake) tabulations already filled in, but did not take screenshots of some blank races because I got tired of taking screenshots. The races with no (fake) vote counts are all minor races, such as those for city councils and local initiatives. \nAsk yourself this question: \nWhy would the website of KFVS12, a local TV station in Missouri, have the final vote counts for some races in the upcoming November 8 elections already filled in? \nIf KFVS12's election results webpage as it is now is merely a \"test-run\" to ensure that the webpage will be operative on November 8, why are the vote counts of some races -- all relatively unimportant local races -- blank? If the page is a \"test,\" there should be \"test\" vote counts for every race. \nCan anyone offer another explanation for what's been presented in this post? I'm open to alternative, non-election-fraud explanations. \nIs our entire democratic polity an illusion? \nH/t FOTM 's bongiornoc",

    "title": "Bernie Sanders Could Replace President Trump With Little-Known Loophole",
    "text": "Bernie Sanders Could Replace President Trump With Little-Known Loophole Read this article and then share with your friends. By Matt Masur / huffingtonpost.com \nHere is exactly what we need to do to save our great society. The information here is what we've all been waiting for. By doing this we can make Bernie the president on Inauguration day rather than President-elect Donald Trump . \nActually, no we can't. There is no loophole that allows a random person to assume the office of president. That's pretty basic common sense but yet you clicked or even shared this article anyway. Now that right there is the real point of this post＃ \nOur social media sites have been flooded with misinformation in the past few months. While this has always been a problem, it now appears to have exploded over this election season. We are seeing post after post stating just plain illogical things and this is not a problem unique to any one side. \nEven more dangerous are the posts that don't appear to be far-fetched until you dig into the details. The big problem with that＃ People don't dig for the details. \nThere will be many people who clicked share on this post because of its headline. They may not even click to open the story. They will never actually read these words. Ironically these are the folks who need to hear it the most. \nAs John Oliver correctly pointed out Sunday night, folks are being fed what they want to hear and they're eating it up like a starving person. The most important thing in a functional society is a well-informed public. What we have now is not only uninformed but misinformed masses. That's something that should scare us all. The most important thing in a functional society is a well-informed public. What we have now is not only uninformed but misinformed masses. \nHow do we combat this problem? Easy, we have to do some work. While I could give a long dissertation on what exactly that means, no one has the patience to read it all, so here are five quick steps that'll fit in a meme＃ \n1. Read first. Then share. I myself am guilty of basing comments or even clicking share based on the headline. This is the worst thing any of us could do. Stop being lazy. \n2. Check the source (and their sources). In the age of new media true and valid information comes from non-traditional sources but so does a lot of garbage. Any article that posts facts, figures or quotes should provide a source for that information. If there is no backup for their claims, move on. \n3. Watch out for recycled stories. One thing that seems to be feeding into the misinformation problem is when old stories are being presented as happening now. Check the date on the story before you read on. You'll be shocked to see how many are from another time and aren't applicable to the current event you thought they were talking about. \n4. If you care about facts, ignore the blatantly slanted. Having a slant or taking a position on a story is not wrong in itself. What is wrong is when these ideas are taken as unbiased fact. You can avoid all of this by simply avoiding those sites to start with. Any website with the words: Conservative, Liberal, Democrat, Republican, etc. in the title are just advertising how slanted they are. That's ok if you choose to live in your side's bubble but please don't have any delusions that these stories reflect the whole picture. \n5. Google it. God (and Sergey ) gave us Google for a reason. If you see a story that's unbelievable or has no sources or even if it does, verify. See if the same facts are reported across multiple outlets. See if anyone disputes these facts.

This event speaks to the final destruction of the state apparatus and the transformation of its governing institutions into one continuous comedy.

    "text": "Scandalous Poll: 84% of Ukrainians want Putin as their president November 13, 2016 - Fort Russ - Zavtra - translated by J. Arnoldski - The Ukrainian publication Nedelya.UA conducted a poll among its readers asking the following question: ※Which politician would you entrust with the governance of your country?§ The survey was participated in by 41,600 readers and showed the following figures: 84% (34,900) of Ukrainian respondents want to see Vladimir Putin as president of Ukraine. In second place with 5% (2,000) was Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Third place with 2% (820) was claimed by Xi Jinping and fourth, also with 2% (708) was leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky. The current president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, took 5th place with only 1% (538 votes). Further down the list were German Chancellor Angela Merkel (1%, 430 votes), the chairman of the French National Front Marine Le Pen (1%, 426 votes), Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev (1%, 318), and US President Barack Obama (1%, 244 votes). Notably enough, former Georgian president and until recently head of the Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili, was not included on the list. According to doctor of economic sciences and director of the Institute for Problems of Globalization, Mikhail Delyakin, the results are not representative. The expert remarked: ※Without a doubt, the figures are unrepresentative: not only Ukrainians could take part in the voting, and the audience of the site speaks Russian - there is no Ukrainian version. At the same time, it is hardly likely, for example, that the Russian readers of this Ukrainian site are supporters of Putin. They are most likely fans of Bandera.§ ※On the other hand, the main part of Ukraine (including Banderites) speaks Russian, not Ukrainian. This was exposed by Guinness, which conducted an innocent poll on the quality of vegetables and allowed respondents to choose between surveys in Ukrainian or Russian. 77% chose Russian. Since then, this share has declined, but it is still clearly more than half even taking into account the departure of Crimea, the DPR and LPR, and the fact that most educated and cultured, i.e., Russian-speaking Ukrainians have fled to every corner, and mainly Russia, from this ＆victorious democracy' and the European Nazi course,§ Delyagin pointed out. ※Nevertheless, it might be that overall these figures reflect the real mood of those Ukrainians who have been brutalized by the complete nobody thieves and killers imposed upon them by the West as their leaders. For the same motives, the most respected political leader in Russia is Stalin. Respect for Putin even sometimes appears among Russophobes who think: ＆With such a leader, we would have long ago defeated those Moskals,§ Delyagin continued. The economist concluded with the following commentary: ※Of course, this does not mean that the destructive liberal socio-economic policies pursued in Russia by appointees like Medvedev and Navulinnaya are correct. However, against the general backdrop of the nobody leaders of the modern West and its satellites, Putin is really a symbol of reason and hope for a better future for all of humanity, not the rapidly dwindling ＆Golden Billion.'§ Follow us on Facebook!",

    "text": "November 14, 2016 - Fort Russ News - \n\nFabrizio Poggi, in  Contropiano , translated from Italian by Tom Winter \n\nIgor Dodon, President-elect of Moldova \nMoldova and Bulgaria: Something new in the East \nRumen Radev, President-elect of Bulgaria \nIn the east - not everywhere, sadly - there is a turn towards Moscow. The newly elected presidents of Moldavia and Bulgaria seem to want to go in that direction. \n\nIn Kishinev, where two weeks ago, no candidate had a majority in round one, the Socialist Party leader, Igor Dodon, has 52.6% of the votes (not including expatriate votes from US and Canada, but these can not overturn the result) against the pro-EU Maia Sandu, leader of the Action and Solidarity Party, with 47.3% and who, in Yankee fashion, is now threatening \"mass demonstrations,\" not recognizing the result. \nMaia Sandu  Dodon congratulated Sandu for the \"honorable result\" and invited her to discussions, without destabilizing the country. It seems (though not official at this time of writing) that the turnout was respectable; this was the first direct election of the president of the republic since 1996; since 2000 in fact, the President was elected by Parliament. There was even shortage of ballots, in particular in various stations abroad: Bologna, Parma, Paris, Moscow, Bucharest; Portugal appears to have lost the entire st of ballots. \n\nOn the eve of the vote Dodon, an experienced office-holder, (Deputy Prime Minister in 2008-2009 and Minister of Economy in 2006-2009) said that if he won, his first visit abroad would would be to Moscow, \"to start working out a strategic partnership agreement\" and to renew exports to Russia, which were limited after the signing of the association and free trade agreement with the EU.  \n\nDodon has always said he was \"confident of victory. People are tired of the seven years of EU coalition, poverty, corruption, lawlessness, and want to live in a state of their own and not in some province of another country.\"  \n\nThe socialist leader has also called for the Russian peacekeepers to remain in Transnistria, until the complete solution of the political events through the federalization of Moldova, which Sandu opposes. According to Tass, all candidates had based their election campaign primarily on foreign issues: pointing on one side to the \"hand of the Kremlin,\" and, on the other to \"Washington's Regional Committee,\"  a side which was still floating a union with Romania. The Socialists pointed to Maia Sandu as \"a puppet of the US\" - where she studied and worked at the World Bank, and tied her to Angela Merkel, Donald Tusk, and Jean-Claude Juncker, apparently even to former Romanian President, Traian B?sescu, who got himself awarded Moldovan citizenship [! -tr] in order to vote for Maia Sandu.  \n\nOn the other side Sandu was proposing, along with strategic partnership with Washington, close contacts with Kiev, even a future union with Romania. \n\nAs expected, there are the threats of yet another \"Orange Revolution,\" like the one in 2009 after the Communist Party won the election in Moldova, under the flags of EU and Romania, with rioting which brought broken windows and arson to the Parliament and the presidential residence.  \n\nObviously, Brussels was on the \"orange\" side: the results of seven years of EU-line coalition are also seen in the demonstrations a year ago against the oligarchy in power, in the rejection of government policy on the part of 80% of the population, and in those favoring integration with Brussels falling from 70% to 37%.  \n\nIn addition, the Donald Trump victory seems to have played a role also in Kishinev: \"The geopolitical color of the Moldovan leadership will become less important for the United States,\" Andrei Popov said in a NewsMaker interview. Popov, former Deputy Foreign Minister of Moldova, added that Washington will renounce a whole series of Moldovan projects that were initiated by the Clinton circle. \n\nAlso, in Bulgaria, the coalition headed by the Socialist Party prevailed in the second presidential round of the general election: Air Force General Rumen Radev topped his opponent Tsetska Tsa?eva by 4-5% (the result is not final). Tsa?eva was the candidate of the pro-government coalition GERB (\"Citizens for European development of Bulgaria).\"  \n\nIn the first round, Sunday, Nov. 6, no candidate reached the 30% necessary for the election: Radev was at 25.4% and Tsa?eva at 21.9%.  \n\nThe now president-elect said he was opposed to Bulgaria's permanence in NATO (of which the country has been a member since 2004) and in the EU, and has spoken out for closer relations with Russia.  \n\nThe Prime Minister, the hawk Boyko Borissov had promised to resign if Radev won, while he was still hoping for a Tsa?eva victory, seems to have kept his word, opening a crisis that does not seem easy to solve. \n\nIn opposition to the overtly anti-Russian, phil-atlantic policies of former President Rosen Plevneliev and Boyko Borissov, Radev said that \"deepening the dialogue with Russia will reduce confrontation and tension, and hopefully lead to the normalization of the situation in Syria and Ukraine.\"  \n\nWith regard to the anti-Russian sanctions, he stressed that this \"is a matter of the government's responsibility. But, as President, I am committed to dialogue, to seek a solution with EU colleagues.\" As for internal affairs, he said \"despite threats of the apocalypse,\" the voters \"voted for change and democracy, overcoming apathy and fear.\" \n\nAn entity that in contrast does not change policy towards Russia is the European Union.  Federica Mogherini,  EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, said that Brussels does not intend to change its own position on Russia, even if the White House, after the arrival of Donald Trump, pursues a rapprochement with the Kremlin.  \n\nThe EU, as Mogherini spelled it out, \"has a principled stand on the issue of the annexation of the Crimea and on the situation in Ukraine, and will not change it, regardless of any changes of position by other countries, including the United States.  \n\n\"Ipse dixit et salvavit eos**; of course, the \"Russian aggression! \n\n\n* A view from the Italian Communist Party on-line journal; for the take of Eduard Popov on these two election victories, click. \n\n** \"She herself has said it, and saved them\" [Correcting to \"ipsa\"] -- an apparent reference to the Catholic confessional \"dixi et salvavi animam\" -- I have spoken and saved my soul.\"\n\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \n                                                   \n\n       Follow us on Twitter! \n                               \n\n             Donate!",

For all the leftist politics on the surface, beneath the waters is the murkier tide in which folks like the Clintons swim. It's the dark water in which money gets you access to Hillary or Obama.

    "text": "Freedom Center Urges College Presidents to End Aid to Campus Supporters of Terror ※We ask that you withdraw all university privileges granted to SJP.§ October 31, 2016 Frontpagemag.com \nEditor's Note: The following letter was sent to the presidents of the ten campuses named in the Freedom Center's report on the ※Top Ten Schools Supporting Terrorists.§ In alphabetical order, the ten campuses are: Brooklyn College (CUNY), San Diego State University, San Francisco State University, Tufts University, University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Irvine, University of California, Los Angeles, University of Chicago, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and Vassar College. \nOctober 27, 2016 \nUniversity of California \nDear Dr. Napolitano, \nYour school purports to promote the values of diversity, inclusiveness and tolerance yet provides resources, funding and legitimacy to Students for Justice in Palestine. Students for Justice in Palestine is a campus organization whose sole purpose is to conduct hateful propaganda against Jews and the Jewish state for the terrorist organization Hamas. The explicit goals of Hamas are the destruction of the world's only Jewish state and genocide against its Jewish population. For these reasons, among others, three campuses of the University of California〞Irvine, Los Angeles, and Berkeley〞have been named among the ※Top Ten Schools Supporting Terrorists§ by the David Horowitz Freedom Center. You may read the full report here: http://www.stopthejewhatredoncampus.org/news/top-ten-schools-supporting-terrorists-fall-2016-report \nWhile it masquerades as a typical campus cultural group, SJP is an integral part of Hamas's efforts to annihilate Israel through the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign. This is an insidious effort that attempts to delegitimize Israel, and smear it as a rogue ※apartheid§ nation. These claims are ludicrous. More than a million Palestinians enjoy Israeli citizenship including the rights to vote and to sit on the Israeli courts and parliament. Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz has said of the BDS movement, ※It is anti-Semitic, anti-Zionist, anti-human rights, anti-intellectual, anti-science, anti-negotiation, anti-peace, anti-compromise, and anti-Palestinian workers when they are denied opportunities to work.§ Both Larry Summers and Hillary Clinton have denounced BDS as anti-Semitic Jew hatred. Yet your school provides a platform and funding for its sponsors. \nWith university support, SJP also conducts ※Israeli apartheid§ hate weeks on campus quads. These events feature pro-Hamas advocates, the construction of ※apartheid walls§ featuring pro-Hamas, anti-Semitic propaganda, and the creation of mock checkpoints and die-ins that disrupt student movements on campus. SJP actively disrupts pro-Israel campus events〞a threat to free speech and a violation of your university's stated values and rules of conduct. \nIn addition to being scripted by Hamas terrorists, SJPs pro-terror campaign is funded and guided through a Hamas front called American Muslims for Palestine. In recent testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Jonathan Schanzer, who worked as a terrorism finance analyst for the United States Department of the Treasury from 2004-2007, described how Hamas funnels large sums of money and provides material assistance to Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) through the Hamas front group American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) for the purpose of promoting BDS campaigns on American campuses. AMP was created by SJP co-founder Hatem Bazian, a pro-terrorist lecturer at UC Berkeley who called for a suicide bombing ※Intifada§ inside the United States. It employs high-ranking officials from other Muslim ※charities§ that were previously shut down for providing material assistance to terrorists. \nSchanzer described AMP as ※arguably the most important sponsor and organizer for Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), which is the most visible arm of the BDS campaign on campuses in the United States.§ He detailed how AMP ※provides speakers, training, printed materials, a so-called ＆Apartheid Wall,' and grants to SJP activists§ and ※even has a campus coordinator on staff whose job is to work directly with SJP and other pro-BDS campus groups across the country.§ Furthermore, ※according to an email it sent to subscribers, AMP spent $100,000 on campus activities in 2014 alone.§ \nStudents for Justice in Palestine continues to accept funding and aid through the Hamas front group American Muslims for Palestine. Despite its links to terrorist organizations and agendas, Students for Justice in Palestine continues to receive campus funds and campus privileges, including university offices, and the right to hold events preaching the genocidal values of Hamas on university property. These privileges would normally be denied to groups that preach hatred of any other ethnic group, let alone one that supports barbaric terrorists who slaughter men, women and children with the goal of cleansing the earth of people who disagree with them. \nIn light of these facts, we ask that you withdraw all university privileges granted to SJP and other campus groups who promote the genocidal Hamas agenda, and that you put an end to the terrorist influences which have infiltrated your campus and which threaten the security not only of Jewish students on your campus, but of all Americans. \nDavid Horowitz ceo The David Horowitz Freedom Center Sherman Oaks, California",

    "text": "Hillary Clinton and the President's ' Longer Game .' At home and abroad, a nation less affluent, less free, and far less secure. October 31, 2016 Lloyd Billingsley \nThe President of the United States, the most powerful man in the world, used a pseudonym to communicate with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on her private, unsecured email server. As Andrew McCarthy contended , that was the reason the FBI declined to prosecute Clinton, because the president would have been part of the same action, and that wouldn't be politically correct. \nThe current president of the United States is also on record that, contrary to custom, he will linger in Washington DC for a few years. Wherever he chooses to live, the email intrigue suggests continuing back-channel communications with Hillary Clinton, should she become president. That invites a look at what the man the New York Times dubbed ※Obama's narrator,§ the White House adviser who sat closest to the president and signed off on his every word, had to say about the president's vision of the future. \n※Few of the decisions he had made would satisfy the politics of the moment,§ David Axelrod explained in his massive 2015 Believer . ※But at home and abroad, Obama was playing a longer game.§ As he explained in Columbia, Missouri, on October 30, 2008, ※We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.§ \nIf this man was a liberal, as Barry Rubin wondered in Silent Revolution: How the Left Rose to Political Power and Cultural Dominance , why did he see a need fundamentally to transform a nation shaped by liberals such as Franklin Roosevelt with his New Deal and Lyndon Johnson with his Great Society? He saw the need because he was not a liberal but a lifelong leftist radical. \nAs David Horowitz explained in Volume 7 of the Black Book of the American Left , the president was ※born, bred and trained in the progressive movement.§ His mentors were ※Communists and their progressive successors,§ so no wonder he presided over ※the institutionalizing of the policies of the left in government§ for eight years. What that means in practical terms is becoming painfully evident. \nThe economy remains sluggish and under Obamacare, the president's signature plan, premiums are skyrocketing . This suggests that, as many believe, Obamacare was simply a demolition plan. In the ※longer game,§ designated successor Hillary Clinton will impose government monopoly healthcare, what some candidates erroneously call ※socialized medicine.§ \nAs Rubin noted, the goal of the left is ※to convince Americans the exact opposite of what their experience proved: that the country had fundamentally failed and the old leftist solutions were the answer.§ The result ※may be a very long-term and even permanent change of the United States into something else, a nation far less affluent and far less free.§ And far less secure, as David Axelrod also indicates. \nVladimir Putin makes an appearance in Believer but Obama's narrator does not outline Putin's background in the KGB. The believer includes nothing about Putin's role in East Germany, a Stalinist police state that walled in its subjects and shot those attempting to escape. The narrator avoids Putin's belief that the breakup of the Soviet Union was ※the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.§ \nIn Believer , Putin tells the president, ※You are a highly educated man. I come from the security sector.§ The believer then asks the president for his assessment of Putin. \n※He's smart, tough, clear about his interests and without a trace of sentimentality,§ the president says. That is not very strong language for a KGB veteran and expansionist autocrat. \nIn his narrator's account, the president uses the word ※motherf",

    "text": "Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN H ad Comey recommended Hillary be held criminally responsible for mishandling classified State Department documents last July, along with perjury for lying to the FBI and Congress, a firestorm of criticism wouldn't have followed his Friday announcement. \n1. THE COMEY IMBROGLIO \nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D. NV) accused him of ※tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo,§ saying his action ※appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another§  claiming he ※may have broken the law,§ citing the 1939 Hatch Act (An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities). It prohibits federal executive branch employees from engaging in certain forms of political activity  exempting the president, vice president and designated high-level administration officials. Proof of intent is required to hold someone culpable under the law. .. According to the Wall Street Journal , within the FBI, there was ※ sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign.§ .. In a prominently featured NYT op-ed , Law Professor Richard Painter said ※(w)e cannot allow FBI or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power.§ .. Not according to former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman, saying ※Comey's critics cannot show his letter violated the Hatch Act unless they can prove that the FBI director was intending to influence the election rather than inform Congress, which was (his) stated aim.§ .. A Sunday released ABC News/Washington Post poll indicated about a third of likely voters are less likely to support Hillary following Comey's October surprise. .. The Washington Post said the Justice Department's public integrity unit blocked the FBI from investigating the Clinton Foundation, claiming inadequate ※evidence to move forward.§ The department is run by longtime Bill and Hillary ally, Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Last June, she met privately with the former president at Phoenix's Sky Harbor airport while Hillary was under FBI investigation  a clear conflict of interest despite her disingenuously claiming ※no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body§ took place. .. In a Washington Post op-ed , former attorney general Eric Holder expressed concern about Comey's ※vague letter to Congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of public, and political, interest§  claiming he ※violated long-standing Justice Department policies and tradition.§ .. Holder disgraced the office he held. Law Professor Francis Boyle called him ※a total disaster for the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, Human Rights and the Rule of Law.§ Speaking in Florida on Sunday, Hillary changed the subject, saying ※ there's a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want, and what kind of president can help us get there. We won't be distracted no matter what our opponents throw at us.§ .. Clearly, Comey's bombshell changed the dynamic of the race, whether enough to derail her White House bid we'll know in days. Reports indicate the FBI will examine an astonishing 650,000 emails from former Congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop  estranged husband of top Hillary aide Huma Abedin. .. \nIt could take months to review volume this immense, likely extending well beyond November 8 and January's inauguration, to determine if any evidence warrants prosecuting Hillary, Abedin, Weiner or anyone else for mishandling classified government documents, perhaps compromising national security. \n2. INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS & SELF-INFLICTED POLITICAL IDIOCY \nHarvard Undergrads for Hillary \nOVERWHELMING SYSTEMIC PROPAGANDA ALLIED WITH A PERVASIVE INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS CONSPIRE TO KEEP MINDS THAT SHOULD KNOW BETTER FROM SEEING THE MOST ELEMENTARY TRUTHS. BEING OFFICIALLY ※SMART§ IS NO VACCINE AGAINST THE BRAINWASH. A ccording to the student newspaper Harvard Crimson's October survey , 87% of undergrads support Hillary. A scant 6% back Trump, 5.8% for Libertarian Gary (※what's Aleppo§) Johnson, and less than 1% for Harvard College and Medical School graduate Jill Stein  the only people's candidate running. .. Around one-third of undergrads responded (2,128 out of a total 6,645 student body)  so the views of nonrespondents aren't known. About 91% are eligible to vote in November. Eligibility begins at age 18. A surprising 96% of respondents intend voting, they said. .. The national average is far lower. Whether this year's contentious election encourages a larger than usual turnout remains to be seen. The Crimson poll was conducted from October 10  20  before FBI Director Comey's October surprise. Whether it would have changed the results is unknown. Two-thirds of respondents said they support Democrat party candidates, 12% calling themselves Republicans, 19% saying they're independents. .. Trump and Hillary are the most widely reviled presidential aspirants in US history. Yet 70% of Crimson respondents view her favorably  showing little knowledge of her deplorable public record since the 1990s unless they support her war crimes, racketeering and perjury. What to make of it? Undergrads enter Harvard (and other colleges) as teenagers, young and naive as I was when entering the college long ago. .. After graduation, I discovered the meaning of the term ※commencement.§ Institutions like Harvard teach students to be good citizens, omitting the ugly stuff about US imperialism, officials advancing it, waging endless wars of aggression. .. The so-called Korean War was ongoing when I was there, an incentive to maintain good grades, stay in school, avoid being drafted and sent to North Korea's frozen Chosin, an expression used by members of my class. .. The Paper Chase Hollywood film (1973) featured John Houseman as stern Harvard Law School Professor Charles Kingsfield. His most memorable line on day one for first year students was saying ※(y)ou teach yourselves the law, but I train your minds. You come here with a skull full of mush. You leave thinking like a lawyer.§ .. I began my freshman year ※with a skull full of mush,§ gradually extracting it. College and graduate school taught me to think. Learning and comprehension mostly came later. The older I get, the greater my understanding of world and national issues. .. I'm long removed from campus life. Back then, students had none of the advantages available today  no computers, no Internet. Daily writing I dearly love now was a dreaded chore back then  requiring research by rolodex cards and library stacks, a time-consuming process. Except for the type primary research I did for my master's thesis, most everything needed today for compositions or articles like mine is available on our desktops. .. It's understandable why young minds haven't achieved the wisdom of the ages. Still it's disturbing to find Harvard undergrads uninformed and out-of-touch on Hillary's deplorable public record  when it's so easy to research it and know what she and husband Bill are all about. .. Why hasn't the Harvard student body done its homework for perhaps the most important election in our lifetime. The stakes are huge  possible war on Russia with Hillary empowered or improved bilateral relations under Trump. Nothing matters more than saving humanity from the scourge of catastrophic thermonuclear war able to kill us all.

The HRC leader concluded by saying that it is very important that people who are pro-equality voters for Clinton in the next presidential election.\nBreitbart stated that an artist from the Art Wing Conspiracy group said a lot of Trump supporters, especially amongst the LGBT community, are ※in the closet.§ The artistic group has painted several Think Different posters across the city of San Francisco near the offices of Twitter and Clinton's campaign headquarters.

They were released on National Coming Out Day.\nThe Art Wing Conspiracy artist also stated that on National Coming Out Day the organization encourages people to ※stop living a lie and come out.§ He conveyed this idea, in a voting booth, i.e. a closet, no one has to know who supports Trump or Clinton.\nThe artist also said that the liberal community in San Francisco must know that there are many Trump supporters amongst the city's LGBT community. The individual stated that having pride means to be true to oneself and one's beliefs, even if it is against the mainstream. The artist concluded that is what the LGBT rights movement conveys.\nThe Stonewall Inn's website stated that the historic inn was the birthplace of the historic LGBT rights movement. The patrons of the club retaliated against harassment from the local police department. Subsequently, a riot occurred on June 28, 1969.\nThe website also claimed that the patrons refused to accept the status quo of oppression for the first time. They then stood up for each other and the whole LGBT community.\nThe site continues to state that the riot at the Stonewall Inn sparked the lengthy battle for all members of the Gay and Lesbian community. The incident is often referred to as the Rosa Parks incident of the LGBT community. The site then stated that the incident led the government and society, in general, to look at members of the LBGT community as equals.\nIn 1969 the police raided gay clubs regularly. Eight police officers arrived at the Stonewall Inn on a Saturday morning at 1:20. Approximately 200 people were in the establishment that night. However, the raid was not conducted as planned. The patrons did not cooperate, resulting in the riot that led to the LGBT rights movement of the 1970s, which is why the HRC now exists and has endorsed a candidate for the 2016 election.\nBy John A.

    "text": "After a long night and a hard election, Donald J. Trump was elected as the 45th President of the United States. In the early hours of November 9, 2016, Hillary Clinton conceded the election.\nBoth candidates helped usher in a new political era; she is the first woman to get this far in a presidential election successfully. Whereas, Trump is the first person to be elected to the highest office in the U.S. who never served in the military and never served in a political capacity.\nWhen the night culminated with Trump winning well over the required 270 electoral votes, the election was called. The reality star now holds a new title, President Elect Donald J. Trump.\nHis presidency will begin with Republicans holding the majority in both chambers of Congress. President-Elect Trump will be nominating a new Supreme Court Justice to fill the seat vacated when Antonin Scalia died in February.\nSurprising Night at the Polls On November 8, the polls began to close at 6:00 p.m. ET on the east coast. Whereas on the west coast, the polls closed 11:00 p.m. There were early projections, which made hearts race. The numbers bounced back and forth in many key swing states. That is until eastern state's tallies began to roll in, then the numbers evened out.\nPolling Site Glitches Many polling sites experienced technical issues. Trump attempted early in the day to sue Nevada because the polls in Clark County remained open for an hour and a half on Nov. 7. The judge stated there was no fraud since the state's law indicates if a person is in line before the polling site closes, they must be allowed to cast their ballot.\nIn Durham County, N.C., there was a delay beginning the votes, so the Democratic Party sought to have the time extended to make up for time lost. This was granted, and the polls remained open for 30 of the 45 minutes requested.\nDonald Trump Needs to Reunite the Country Commentators on CNN Politics agree that the campaign tore through the fabric that makes America great. During the campaigning, citizens became polarized into two drastically divisive and hateful camps.\nHow is President Elect Trump going to heal the wounds he inflicted on Clinton's supporters, the Muslim community, Latino citizens, and every other group?\nDuring Trump's campaign, he threatened to have Clinton arrested when he won, build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, close the mosques, and restart stop and search policies. He said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, and lower the tax ceiling for the richest Americans.\nHis supporters are thrilled, and Clinton's voters are stunned. There are fear and confusion in the air.\nHillary Clinton Concedes Clinton sent out her campaign manager to tell her supporters that it was late and the final tallies were not going to happen soon. She asked them to go home and get some rest. The announcement was made that Clinton would speak in the morning.\nWithin an hour, Trump told his supporters that she had called him and conceded. The President-Elect proffered a simple acceptance. He stated that his was not a campaign but a movement for change.\nBy Cathy Milne\nSources:\nCNN Politics: 2016 Election Results\nMSNBC: Live 2016 Election Coverage\nNBC News: Breaking News Alerts\nImage Courtesy of Gage Skidmore's Flickr Page  Creative Commons License    #CMJournalist , Hillary Clinton , President Elect , spot , Trump , VP Elect",

    "text": "On Nov. 20, 2016, AP reported that former Greek President Constantine Stephanopoulos who was the former president of Greece had died. Stephanopoulos was 90 at the age of his passing.\nThe former Greek president had entered a hospital on Thursday, Nov. 17 when he was suffering from pneumonia. While at the hospital his condition hastily waned as he struggled through the night.\nOn Saturday Stephanopoulos's doctors had released a statement that said he was suffering from multiple organ failures. The report also indicated that he was not responding to treatment.\nThe late president of Greece was known to most residents of the country as Costis. Stephanopoulos presidency of Greece dated from the year 1995 and lasted unto the year 2005. The former Greek statesman served the two terms that were allowed by the constitution of the nation.\nStephanopoulos won wide popular approval with his modesty and lack of pomposity. Although, the Greek presidency is largely ceremonial.\nDespite being a conservative Stephanopoulos worked well with other politicians from across the political spectrum. The late president of Greece especially worked well with former Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis. Costas was also prime minister of Greece from the year 1996 unto the year 2004.\nWritten by John A.

    "title": "Remembering President John F. Kennedy [Video]",
    "text": "The 53 rd anniversary of the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is remembered and his life is celebrated.\nOn Nov. 22, 1963, the 35 th President of the United States was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, at 12:30 p.m., in Dallas, Texas. He was in a motorcade with his wife Jacqueline, the Governor of Texas John Connally and his wife. They were traveling through Dealey Plaza when he was shot.\nHe won the 1960 election by a narrow margin, although, in 1961, more than 60 percent of the population claimed they voted for Kennedy. He brought a special new aspect to the White House; a young family, culture, laughter, and class. Most importantly, Americans felt he brought the people hope.\nKennedy was the only Catholic President of the United States. He once stated:\nThere are three things in life; God, human folly, and laughter. The first two are beyond our comprehension, we must make the best of the third.\nThe Life of Kennedy: His great-grandparents were immigrants from County Wexford, Ireland. He was fortunate to have not suffered poverty or discrimination, except for the Boston Brahmins, who believed he was ※Shanty Irish.§ He knew he was a Fenian.\nDuring World War II, his father's influence helped him enlist in the United States Navy. Kennedy was a skipper of PT-109, in the Salmon Islands. A Japanese destroyer cut his boat in two, in a night action. He was thrown back into the bridge, causing a lifetime back injury. Despite his pain, the skipper collected his crew and saved a burned crewmate by placing a belt under the man's arms and towing him to shore, holding the belt in his teeth. This act of valor earned him the Navy and Marine Corps. Medal and a Purple Heart.\nThe Kennedy Presidency: October 1962, the president had to face Russia, concerning the missiles in Cuba. Generals wanted to go to war. However, Kennedy had experienced war, thus, he negotiated a settlement. The world viewed this as a victory for Kennedy.\nOn June 11, 1963, his Civil Rights speech was televised across the nation. He asked Americans to allow equal rights for their fellow African-American citizens. In his speech, Kennedy stated that the nation was facing a moral issue that was ※as old as the Scriptures and as clear as the American Constitution.§\nPresident Kennedy's Civil Rights Bill was passed by Lyndon Johnson, in 1964.\nAlso in June 1963, Kennedy delivered a speech in Berlin. This famous speech is known as ※Ich bin EIN Berliner.§ He offered the citizens of the country hope and warned Russia that their time was coming.\nHe left Berlin and flew to Ireland to address the Irish Parliament. Kennedy made a point to visit Arbour Hill, the mass grave of 14 of the martyrs in the Easter Rebellion. He is the only United States leader to honor this memorial. He read the names of those buried there, while the Irish Prime Minister Sean Lemass walked by his side. Lemass knew many of the leaders in that grave.\nOn Aug. 5, 1963, Kennedy signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This was supposed to make the world a safer place. Nonetheless, four days later, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, the infant son of the president, died. He was two days old.\nMonday, November 18, President Kennedy made a stopover in Tampa, Florida. He was the first president to be a guest of this city. Among the multitude of conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of the former president are a few that involve his visit to Tampa.\nTampa Conspiracy Theory: One of the many conspiracy theories claims there was a gunman at the Floridian Hotel. This gunman was prepared to assassinate President Kennedy. This theory is supported by the reports of organized crime in Tampa Bay. Per the story, the Floridian Hotel would be a good place for a sniper to set-up, in preparation to take a shot.\nOswald Acted Alone Despite Disbelief: However, Warren Commission investigated the assassination of President Kennedy and determined, in September 1964, that there was no evidence of a conspiracy. It was concluded that Oswald acted on his own.\nThe Associated Press conducted a poll in April 2013, and 50 percent of the American population believed more than one person was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy. They also believe it was a conspiracy. However, 24 percent of the people think Oswald acted on his own and 16 percent were undecided. A Gallup poll, in 2003, revealed 75 percent of Americans thought there was a conspiracy involved in the death of the president.\nIn Remembrance: Springfield, Massachusetts, held a ceremony, to honor former President Kennedy, at 1 p.m., on Nov. 22, 2016, at the Eternal Flame in Forest Park. U.S. Rep. Richard Neal and Mayor Domenic Sarno were in attendance.\nA memorial wreath and three red roses were left at the Eternal Flame. The ceremony included a moment of silence in honor of Betty Sullivan, the wife of former Springfield Mayor William Sullivan. She recently passed away.\nBy Jeanette Smith\nSources:\nChannel 8 News: Tuesday marks 53rd anniversary of JFK's assassination\nIrish Central: Remembering JFK  the assassination took place 53 years ago today\nMass Live: Springfield to remember JFK on 53rd anniversary of assassination\nImage Courtesy of JFK Library/Courtesy of Smithsonian Channel  Used With Permission 53rd Anniversary , assassination , Conspiracy , kennedy , spot",

Millions of people feel entirely disenfranchised by a political system that delivered the least favorable and trusted candidates in U.S. history. Many hoped that the Bernie Sanders campaign would represent a new direction and opportunity to take on entrenched power and extreme inequality, for a higher minimum wage, to defend Social Security, rebuild the labor movement, provide universal health care and free tuition. That campaign was largely suppressed, but its end does not change the desires and aspirations of tens of millions of people, workers and youth in particular, who are demanding real change.

Do you think your vote for president in the United States counts? Think again＃ Ultimately, the Electoral College votes determine who becomes president, not the majority or popular vote. So, what is the Electoral College? The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. (1) The popular vote, on the other hand, is to appease the masses in thinking that they actually have a say in who gets elected. The above image is from NBC affiliate WRCB TV in Chattanooga, TN who apparently already have the results from the election that hasn't occurred yet. (2) So, how is this possible? In 2012, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) legalized the use of PROPAGANDA on the American public. (3) This includes ANYTHING the mainstream media ※reports§ including the election results before they happened. This is reminiscent of the BBC announcing that World Trade Center building 7 collapsed before it actually collapsed on 9/11. (4) Related: British Man Won Law Suit Against BBC for 9/11 Cover Up As reported by Top Right News and other outlets, during a recent interview with Bloomberg News, Soros  a Democrat mega-donor  openly admitted that Trump will win the popular vote in a ※landslide.§ However, he said that none of that would matter, because a president Hillary Clinton is already a ※done deal .§ In the interview, which is now going viral, Soros says with certainty that Trump will take the popular vote , despite what the polls say now (which are completely rigged to oversample Democrats), but not the Electoral College, which will go to Clinton . When the reporter asks if that is already a ※done deal§ that Clinton will be our next president no matter what  Soros says ※yes,§ and nods his head. (5) George Soros is most likely one of the main cogs in the shadow government . Look no further than all of the money his ※Open Society Institute§ donated to ※ Black Lives Matter § (6). His main agenda is to keep America living in the premise of ※Divide and Conquer§. As long as America is divided, we cannot come together under a united cause. A George Soros company, Smartmatic, has provided voting machine technology in 16 states including battleground zones like Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia. You can read more about George Soros and his dark allegiance here . Other jurisdictions affected are California, District of Columbia, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. Its website includes a flow-chart that describes how the company has contributed to elections in the U.S. from 2006-2015 with ※57,000 voting and counting machines deployed§ and ※35 million voters assisted.§ After this report's publication, Smartmatic updated its website to remove the flow chart and declare that ※Smartmatic will not be deploying its technology in any U.S. county for the upcoming 2016 U.S. Presidential elections.§ (7) I'm not buying it.

    "text": "President Elect Trump  A New Era of Unpredictability Awaits President Elect Trump is new title for New York businessman, millionaire and Republican candidate Do... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/president-elect-trump-new-era-of.html President Elect Trump is new title for New York businessman, millionaire and Republican candidate Donald J. Trump, who yesterday on November 8th, 2016 successfully won the US presidential election. Trump managed to defeat favorite Hillary Clinton by a relatively narrow margin. The victory came as a shock to many Americans, regardless of where they reside on the political spectrum. For many in the alternative media, the victory of President Elect Trump comes with a great sense of relief that career criminal Hillary Clinton was not elected (or installed) as so many had expected. Clinton had already showed a propensity to collude, cheat and lie during the Democratic Primaries where she triumphed with dirty tactics over Bernie Sanders.For many others, turned off by Trump's racism, sexism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and generally flippant comments, the Trump victory is devastating and will challenge them psychologically and emotionally to accept the reality for the results. Hillary Clinton: What Went Wrong? The result is especially surprising given the degree to which Hillary Clinton had ingratiated herself with the upper echelons of the NWO ( New World Order ). From an outside perspective, it seemed Clinton had left no stone unturned in brown-nosing and sucking up to the most powerful people and organizations in the world, including the Rothschilds , Goldman Sachs, the Rockefeller CFR ( Council on Foreign Relations ) and many many more. Additionally, given her propensity for criminality and her powerful backers such as George Soros , coupled with the serious problems electronic voting machines possess in being able to be hacked and the vote flipped, many are left wondering how Hillary lost . What went wrong? At this stage in the game of post-election analysis, we can point to a few things. Hillary's criminal past clearly caught up with her. It is unprecedented in the history of US presidential elections for a leading candidate to be under an on-again, off-again criminal investigation. Clinton simply has so many scandals in her recent and distant past that it's like trying to stop a ship with 30 holes from sinking; you can't plug them all. She was also running up against the problem that the Democrats had been in power for 8 years, when recent history shows that power seems to change hands in around that time frame. Clinton represented the establishment, and as the popularity of both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump has shown, people are tired of the same. They intuitively know the system is rigged and corrupt, even if they can't exactly put their fingers on it. Obama, Mr. ※Hope and Change§, got in with a slick campaign of promising something different (upon which he didn't deliver). Trump represented anti-establishment, and whether he truly embodies that or not is an entirely different matter, because it's all about perception. Does a Trump Victory Show that NWO Powerbrokers Are Less in Control than It Seems? The win of President Elect Trump is truly shocking and monumental event. Many people (including myself) were predicting that it was a foregone conclusion that Clinton would win. For instance, founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange stated before the election that ※Trump would not permitted to win§. The MSM ( Mainstream Media ) were clearly favoring Clinton at almost every turn. Whatever you think of Trump, we can at least say the will of the majority of American voters was respected, which is a relief, given how much corruption exists in our society today.The question now is this: is a Trump victory the result the NWO powerbrokers wanted all along, for reasons we are yet to see? Or is it a genuine uprising against these forces? What Does a Trump Presidency Mean for Liberty and Freedom? For me, Trump can be summarized in one word: unpredictable . President Elect Trump truly embodies unpredictability more than any other high-level politician around. One moment he is railing against the 9/11 official story, then he is declaring his love for Israel, then he is bringing up the vaccine-autism connection, then he is suggesting Snowden be killed. Next he is suggesting GMO corn makes you stupid, then he suggesting Muslims be banned from the US, then he is calling global warming a hoax , then he is suggesting the Government be given the power to shut down the internet. Then, after all of that, he makes friendly overtures to Russia while demonizing the hell out of Iran. What does he stand for? Peace or war? Freedom or tyranny?At this stage no one knows, probably not even Trump himself. He has contradicted himself numerous times throughout his campaign, and merely once suggesting a good idea (i.e. looking at who controls the issuance of money instead of letting the international bankers via the Federal Reserve control it) doesn't mean it will become his policy. Unpredictability is one of Trump's great qualities, but also one of his most dangerous. A lot will depend on with whom he surrounds himself once becoming President Trump, and what kind of advice they give him. His VP Mike Pence is a standard conservative Republican who will be no doubt far more to the liking of the NWO conspirators, but Trump is also taking advice from retired DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) chief Michael Flynn, the man who came out and highlighted how the US created ISIS in a declassified DIA document .For now, America and the world have around two-and-a-half months to get over the incredible shock of yesterday's result and psychologically prepare itself for a Trump presidency. Meanwhile, it would be foolish for us to expect that one man can fix all of America's problems. It will be the job of the independent and alternative media to hold Trump to his promises and his word, and to continue to share ideas of how we can truly create a better, freer and more just society. This necessarily involves questioning the very structures and systems of society, and will never magically improve with just the passing of the baton from one politician to another.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/biggest-winners-and-losers-of-2016-us.html The biggest collective losers of the campaign were the mainstream media. Some of course were worse than others, but all of the old fashioned mainstream outlets were terrible. They operated on a basis of contempt for the honest concerns of ordinary people.They hid Hillary Clinton's scandals from public view as though oblivious to the fact that in the internet age, the truth cannot be hidden nor suppressed by the failing media-industrial complex.Long before Donald Trump declared his candidacy, the systematic problems of mainstream media in the west were well known.The total deceit with which they cover international affairs, slandering countries which do not actively pursue neoliberal policies, was in full view. Their job is to report the facts and collect information. Instead they have acted like mad agitators for their pet geopolitical projects.As the mainstream media begins to collapse, so too are common misconceptions about war and peace. In 2003 when mainstream media still had a fairly stern grip on public consciousness, many were duped into believing Bush and Blair's lies about Iraq. Thanks to new media, people in the west have a far better understanding of the realities in the Middle East than they did thirteen years ago. It explains why popular support for war in Syria and by extrapolation on Russia, something that the likes of Hillary Clinton have wildly campaigned for, remains deeply unpopular with ordinary people. The Biggest Winner After Donald Trump , the biggest winners were Julian Assange and Wikileaks . Wikileaks did what honest journalists ought to do, they publish information that is vital to the public interest without having a hidden agenda. Assange expressed his personal disdain for both Trump and Clinton and recently explained the scientific reasons why Wikileaks released damning information on Clinton and not Trump. In all he said he was fair minded and open minded.This remained the case despite Hillary and her supporters making death threats to Assange and Assange having his internet connection at the Ecuadorian Embassy in which he remains captive, cut off after the US State Department put pressure on the Government of Ecuador. But Assange persisted and leak after leak showed American voters and the wider world who Hillary Clinton actually is. It is a very different image from the sugar coated picture painted by the mainstream media. [Her allegiance to the Rothschilds and NWO master manipulator George Soros has also been confirmed , as well as her strong ties to Monsanto .]Wikileaks exposed how Hillary says one thing in public and other to her friends in Wall Street. Wikileaks exposed lie after lie, cover-up after cover-up. Julian Assange's place in history as someone who has exposed the lies of politicians like Hillary Clinton is now assured. He is owed a debt of gratitude by all those who value truth and justice. By Adam Garrie (excerpt) Dear Friends, HumansAreFree is and will always be free to access and use.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/actually-nobody-won-2016-presidential.html ※Nobody for President, that's my campaign slogan,§ Nick Cannon asserted in ※ Too Broke to Vote ,§ his viral criticism of the American electoral process from March of this year. Now, it turns out nobody for president won the 2016 election in a landslide.According to new voter turnout statistics from the 2016 election, 47 percent of Americans voted for nobody, far outweighing the votes cast for Trump (25.5 percent) and Hillary (25.6 percent) by eligible voters.And the ※I voted for nobody§ group is actually much larger than the 47 percent reported because that number only includes eligible voters.How many millions of Americans under the legal voting age 〞 not to mention the countless millions who have lost their voting rights 〞 voted for nobody, as well? Factoring in those individuals, around 193 million people did not vote for Trump or Clinton. That's nearly two-thirds of the population of the United States.Nobody also seemingly won the presidential primaries, with only 9 percent of Americans casting their votes for either Trump or Clinton. So when does nobody take office? Nobody won the majority of votes in the primaries or the general election, and the two main candidates who were running didn't ※win§ the popular vote 〞 they simply slightly outcompeted each other considering neither garnered over 50 percent of the eligible voters' ballots.That's where the real debate begins.As I wrote back in August when the primary voter turnout rates came in, one could argue that Trump (and Obama ) do not have a legitimate mandate to rule over the people of the United States. Trump did not win the majority of Americans' votes 〞 not even close. When all Americans are included, Trump only garnered the votes of about 19 percent of us. This means the United States will be ruled over by a small minority of voters who elected someone to continually impose their political positions on the other 81 percent of us. Ron Paul: ' US Elections Are Rigged & Voting is Used to Pacify the Public ' Of course, as is the case with Democrats looking to assign blame for Hillary's loss, pundits and political pontificators argue the people who didn't vote have no right to complain about the outcome. After all, a non-vote or a vote for a third-party candidate was, in actuality, a vote for Trump. But that logic is flawed. The majority of Americans don't vote anymore because the political system no longer represents them . We've been disenfranchised by decades of corrupt, unrepresentative politicians.The United States, according to a highly-cited academic study, is effectively an oligarchy ※elected§ by a minority of voters ruled by a smaller minority of disliked politicians who represent an even smaller minority of billionaires and special interests. You know it, I know it, hell, even former U.S. President Jimmy Carter knows it . The majority of Americans voted for nobody not because they don't care or because they are apathetic 〞 they voted no confidence in a political system that forgot about them a long time ago.

    "text": "Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/president-trump-man-made-global-warming.html Man-made global warming is a hoax perpetuated by the elite to make money and damage the U.S. economy, according to President-elect Donald Trump  and America isn't going to stand for it anymore. ※Obama thinks it's the number one problem in the world today. I think it's very low on the list,§ Trump said on the Hugh Hewitt show, indicating a major shift in U.S. policy. Trump continued: ※You know in the 1920s people talked about global cooling, they thought the earth was cooling. I believe there is weather and I believe there is change and I believe it goes up and it goes down and it goes up again and it changes depending on years and centuries.※ Pointing out that U.S. manufacturing and the economy as a whole has suffered since climate change rules were introduced by global organizations  making everybody poorer, except the elites who profit from the fearmongering  Trump has promised to make America competitive again.Trump is putting his money where his mouth is. According to a member of his transition team, the President-elect is looking at ways to withdraw as quickly as possible from a costly global climate agreement currently being ratified in Morocco. Since Trump's victory in Tuesday's election, governments ranging from China to small island states have reaffirmed their support for the agreement at climate talks running until November 18 in Marrakesh, Morocco. But Trump believes the global rules and regulations will continue to harm the American economy and the President-elect wants out. ※It was reckless for the Paris Agreement to enter into force before the election,§ the source, who works on Trump's transition team, told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Top Scientist Resigns: ' Global Warming is a $Trillions Scam 〞 It has Corrupted Many Scientists ' 30,000 scientists agree with Trump A staggering 30,000 scientists have come forward agreeing with Trump that man-made climate change is a scam perpetuated by the global elite in order to make money. One of the experts is weather channel founder, John Coleman, who warns that huge fortunes are being made by man-made climate change proponents such as Al Gore . The weather has been so cold for so long that the global warming HOAXSTERS were forced to change the name to climate change to keep $ flow! 〞 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2014 If you're still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his climate change crusade, flying around the world on his private jet, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $200 million in 2016  largely due to investments in fake ※green tech§ companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans. From the National Review : ※A 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.§ Other mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda  even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being pushed by global warming proponents. And, of course, there are the more than 30,000 American scientists (to date) who agree with Trump and have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative  and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. Breaking: Global Warming Data FAKED by Government Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth  not human activity . Many more still are likely to sign the petition and speak out against the mainstream propaganda now that Trump has indicated a major change in U.S. policy. By Baxter Dmitry",

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/the-four-reasons-for-assassination-of.html For me, this case is closed. John F. Kennedy was assassinated for stripping the Rothschild-owned Federal Reserve of its power to print and loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. President Kennedy signed Executive Order No. 11110 on June 4, 1963, which returned to the U.S. government the power to issue currency, without going through the privately-owned Federal Reserve . Unknowingly, he also signed his death sentence that day. President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 and the United States Notes (backed by silver) he had issued were immediately taken out of circulation. Federal Reserve Notes continued to serve as the legal currency of the nation. You can read everything on the subject by following this link .But, it's likely that at least three other factors have played a role in the decision to assassinate him and, later, other members of his family . 2. Not long before his death, President Kennedy famously stated: \"I will splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds.\" It is known that JFK fired CIA Director Allen Dulles and this book claims the latter is responsible for ordering the hit on the US President. 3. In a famous speech, JFK exposed the network of secret societies that operate against the American people and publicly opposed their devious ways of undermining mankind's freedom. Just two years before he was assassinated (1961), JFK gave a really chilling 〞 yet inspiring 〞 speech, exposing secret societies. The warning is especially powerful because it came from a President in office: For me, this speech is remarkable especially because the Kennedys were part of the 13 \"elite\" families that rule the Earth from the shadows. These three facts are clearly showing that JFK declared war against the shadow \"elite\" and their network of secret societies. And for this reason, he and many other members of his lineage have paid the ultimate price . But he was not the only US President who gave us this warning: Former US Presidents and High Officials Warn About the 'Invisible Government' Running the USA 4. Lastly, just ten days before his assassination, JFK asked for access to the UFO files. Based on evidence , the plot for JFK's assassination was already set in motion when he asked to access the UFO files. In fact, new evidence suggests that Lee Harvey Oswald worked directly for Robert F. Kennedy and 〞 shockingly 〞 helped save JFK from an ＆assassination plot' three weeks earlier in Chicago . But, in so doing, he sealed his own fate. You can read more on the subject by accessing this link . But, even though JFK was already marked for assassination, demanding access to the UFO files could have expedited the efforts to take him out before he could succeed. The following article, wrote by Makia Freeman , makes a very strong case in support of this idea. Was JFK murdered mostly because he was trying to gain access to classified information on UFOs, ETs and aliens? As we approach the 53rd anniversary of the JFK assassination (which occurred on November 22, 1963) and mark the death of the greatest US president ever to challenge the New World Order Secret Government, it is worth briefly looking back in time to realize the tremendous lessons from the Kennedy murder. Last year in 2015 I released an in-depth 3-part series on the JFK assassination, dealing with the Who , How and Why of the event, which was a sacrificial mass ritual designed (among other things) to traumatize the American public. In part 3 I compiled a list of the various motives certain people and groups had to kill Kennedy. JFK had crossed the CIA, the Nazis, the Zionists, the Military Industrial Complex, the Federal Reserve and the Mafia  all the while not being part of Secret Society Freemasonic brotherhood. However, was the ultimate reason he was killed due to his persistence and demands in obtaining top secret intelligence on the alien matter? Was JFK murdered because he challenged the power of Majestic-12 or MJ-12, the hidden group Truman had created to be the keepers of UFO and alien secrets? There is substantial evidence to indicate this is indeed the case. Released JFK Letters to CIA and NASA Show His Demand for UFO Files  10 Days Before His Death Two memos authored by Kennedy were released to researcher William Lester under FOIA (Freedom of Information Act). Both were written on November 12, 1963, just 10 days before JFK was murdered. One of them is a letter (pictured below) to CIA Director John McCone, who succeeded CIA Director Allen Dulles, one of the JFK assassination conspirators and masterminds (see part 1 ). In the memorandum with the subject ※Classification review of all UFO intelligent files affecting National Security§, JFK explicitly writes that he has initiated a joint space program with the USSR. He is telling the CIA that he wants to share its UFO, ET and alien data with NASA, and wants to distinguish between knowns and unknowns (we can interpret the ※knowns§ as US controlled secret technology such as anti-gravity craft and the ※unknowns§ as genuine extraterrestrial phenomena). Here is the text: ※As I had discussed with you previously, I have initiated [redacted] have instructed James Webb to develop a program with the Soviet Union in joint space and inner exploration. ※It would be very helpful if you would have the high threat cases reviewed with the purpose of identification of bona fide as opposed to classified CIA and USAF sources. ※It is important that we make a clear distinction between the knowns and unknowns in the event the Soviets try to mistake our extended cooperation as a cover for intelligence gathering of their defense and space programs. ※When this data has been sorted out, I would like you to arrange a program of data sharing with NASA where Unknowns are a factor. This will help NASA mission directors in their defensive responsibilities. ※I would like an interim report on the data review no later than February 1, 1964.§ The other memorandum (National Security Action Memorandum No. 271, pictured below) is addressed to then NASA administrator James Webb. It carries the subject line of ※Cooperation with the USSR on Outer Space Matters§. JFK outlines how he wants NASA to develop a program of cooperation with the Russians in the field of outer space. JFK Murdered Over UFO Intelligence Access  The Bigger Picture However, to put these two memos in context, you need to understand that Kennedy had been chasing the golden goose for a long time. Authors and experts such as Dr. Michael Salla, Richard Hoagland and Mike Bara, some of whose work you can read here in ※ President Kennedy's deadly confrontation with the CIA & MJ-12 over ET/UFO X-Files  Part II §, have done extensive research to show that JFK was determined, before his presidency even began, to get full UFO intelligence access and as president re-take control of the information. He wanted it out of military, unelected hands and placed back into civilian, elected ones. He was out to undo the damage Truman had done, and Eisenhower had continued, by setting up the hidden MJ-12 group in 1947 and keeping the UFO and alien subject under wraps as a giant secret. The following is from a review or synopsis of Salla's book Kennedy's Last Stand: Eisenhower, UFOs, MJ-12 and JFK's Assassination : ※In searching for answers to who killed President Kennedy we need to start with the death of his mentor, James Forrestal in 1949. Forrestal became the first Secretary of Defense in 1947, a position he held until March, 1949. ※Forrestal was a visionary who thought Americans had a right to know about the existence of extraterrestrial life and technologies. ※Forrestal was sacked by President Truman because he was revealing the truth to various officials, including Kennedy who was a Congressman at the time. Forrestal's ideals and vision inspired Kennedy, and laid the seed for what would happen 12 years later. ※After winning the 1960 Presidential election, Kennedy learned a shocking truth from President Eisenhower. The control group set up to run highly classified extraterrestrial technologies, Majestic-12, had become a rogue government agency. ※Eisenhower warned Kennedy that Majestic-12 had to be reined in. It posed a direct threat to American liberties and democratic processes. Kennedy followed Eisenhower's advice, and set out to realize James Forrestal's vision. ※The same forces that orchestrated Forrestal's death, opposed Kennedy's efforts at every turn. When Kennedy was on the verge of succeeding, by forcing the CIA to share classified UFO information with other government agencies on November 12, 1963, he was assassinated ten days later.§ Joint US-USSR Space Missions: JFK Murdered Over Clever Strategy Although JFK surely and naturally had other reasons for wanting to work together with the Soviets (and thus avoid any possibility of a nuclear war), it is quite possible that his proposed joint US-USSR program was an excuse and a clever means to wrest control of the ET issue from the hands of MJ-12. To have NASA cooperate with the Soviet space administration on lunar missions and outer space exploration would necessarily mean sharing data on UFOs. After all, the existence (and extreme technological capacity) of such craft were an obvious security factor and threat that would impact any space expedition. Kennedy already had Soviet leader Nikita Kruschchev on board. Salla writes : ※Documents confirm that on November 12, 1963 Kennedy and Khrushchev had agreed on steps to share UFO information precisely for this reason, and Kennedy identified the CIA as the lead U.S. agency to implement the process. ※Unknown to Kennedy, the CIA's chief of counterintelligence, Angleton, implemented a secret set of directives that would deny access to classified UFO information to Kennedy, his national security staff and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.§ The ※burned memo§ or MJ-12 Kennedy assassination directive The MJ-12 Kennedy Assassination Directive Truth is heavily guarded by layers of secrecy, deception, falsehood and propaganda. Often, government officials hide the truth by overseeing partial disclosures which are carefully orchestrated to give away just enough of the secret without going in too deep. Ever since the Roswell crash of 1947, the US Government kept 2 sets of UFO files. The tamer cases and less controversial information were made publicly available through Project Blue Book, which was the official public investigation into UFOs by the USAF. It formally ended in 1970. However, the really good stuff with high classifications was kept under lock and key by the CIA and MJ-12. Kennedy must have learnt enough about the situation to have known this, and have slowly but surely been making his way to the source of the information. By the time it got to November 12th, 1963, it was the final straw; MJ-12 who controlled the CIA would not allow Kennedy to have UFO intelligence access  at any cost. As mentioned in part 3, the Kennedy assassination directive (pictured above) was written in code language to disguise the hit they were ordering. It uses the Russian spy term ※wet§ (i.e. wet from being drenched in fresh blood) to mean a killing. The memo reads:※when conditions become nonconductive for growth in our environment and Washington cannot be influenced any further... it should be ＆wet.'§ This is from Salla's commentary: ※Dr Robert Wood who is the foremost expert in analyzing MJ-12 documents using forensic methods, has concluded that the burned document is an assassination directive... he pointed out that the cryptic phrase ※it should be wet§ originates from Russia, where the phrase ＆wet works' or ※wet affairs§ denotes someone who had been killed and is drenched with blood. The codeword ＆wet' was later adopted by the Soviet KGB and other intelligence agencies... In drafting this cryptic directive, Allen Dulles was seeking approval from six of his MJ-12 colleagues, to lay the justification for the assassination of any elected or appointed official in Washington DC whose policies were ※non-conducive for growth§. The cryptic directive was a pre-authorization for the assassination of any U.S. President who could not ※be influenced any further§ to follow MJ-12 policies.§ CIA Wiretap of Marilyn Monroe Also Suggests JFK Murdered Over UFO Issue Popular actress Marilyn Monroe was a famous lover of both JFK and his brother Robert, who served as Attorney General in the Kennedy Administration. In April 2014, evidence came to light in the form of an alleged CIA transcription (pictured below). If real  and it appears genuine  it shows that the CIA were wiretapping Monroe and knew she was about to go public and blow the whistle on JFK and UFOs. Here is what the alleged CIA wiretap document (dated August 3, 1962) states: ※Rothberg indicated in so many words, that she [Monroe] had secrets to tell, no doubt arising from her trists [sic] with the President and the Attorney General. ※One such ※secret§ mentions the visit by the President at a secret air base for the purpose of inspecting things from outer space. 2. Subject repeatedly called the Attorney General and complained about the way she was being ignored by the President and his brother. 3. Subject threatened to hold a press conference and would tell all.§ CIA wiretap of Marilyn Monroe: more proof JFK murdered due to UFOs and aliens? Robert Kennedy Also Briefed On UFOs Another piece of evidence substantiating the ※JFK murdered due to UFOs§ hypothesis is that his brother and Attorney General Robert Kennedy was also briefed on the matter. Lieutenant Colonel Philip Corso, a man who served in a number of National Security Council committees from 1953-57 during the Eisenhower presidency, says Bobby actually sought him out. In this short video Corso says he personally briefed Bobby Kennedy on the subject of flying saucers or UFOs. Bobby was JFK's closest advisor. Conclusion: Highly Likely JFK Murdered Over UFOs and ETs / Aliens So at the end of the day was JFK murdered over the UFOs and aliens? While there were many motives for (and conspirators involved in) the killing of JFK, the evidence is overwhelming that his demand for more control over the UFO and alien subject was the crucial factor in the decision by MJ-12 to assassinate him. It may have been the straw that broke the camel's back, but more likely it was the central issue all along. JFK inherited a system from Eisenhower and Truman, US presidents who had already given away substantial control to the Military Industrial Intelligence Complex. Indeed, the very term ※Military Industrial Complex§ (MIC) has only become so commonplace thanks to Eisenhower using it in his farewell speech , where he issued a grave warning to the American public about the power that the MIC already held (but which he also allowed to a large extent). To study the New World Order and the worldwide conspiracy at the deepest levels is to study the UFO, ET and alien agenda. To study UFOs and aliens, in turn, is to accept the existence of free energy technology (aka zero point or over unity energy). This is the gamechanger . Once people accept the reality of free energy and learn how to create and share it, the control grid and conspiracy will evaporate  because knowledgeable and abundant people cannot be controlled. There is so much at stake at here! Thank you JFK and to all others who have dedicated their lives to making this information public, widespread and accessible ! The truth cannot be hidden forever.

    "text": "President Obama is known for his humor, but his interview with Samantha Bee is downright hilarious. \nDuring his final days in office, Obama has been making rounds on talk shows. When he sat down with the host of Full Frontal this week, the result was simply priceless. \nBee took a few shots at him for his age, asking if he would consider an appearance on Antique Roadshow and pointing out the white in his hair. Obama reminded her that he was still president, after all, but Bee was hell bent on making this an interview to remember. \nShe finally asked Obama if he would ※mess§ with Donald Trump once he was done serving as Commander in Chief. \n※After you leave office, have you thought of just whispering in Donald Trump's ear, ＆You were right, I wasn't born here,' just to, like, mess with him?§ Bee asked. \n※I think it's fair to say that I will be organizing my post-presidency where I'm not close enough to him to whisper into his ear,§ Obama shot back. \nThey did discuss some important issues, such as young voters and the struggles that Hillary Clinton may face as the first woman to serve as President of the United States. But the playful back and forth between President Obama and Bee is too funny to miss. It also reminds us just why it is that we are going to miss this man so much when he is gone. \nWatch the interview, here : \nFeatured image via video screen capture Share this Article!",

    "text": "November 6, 2016 Greatest Basketball Player Of Our Era To Help First Woman President Beat Biggest Asshole Of All Time Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \nHe is perhaps the greatest basketball player of all time, certainly of the current era, and he's with her. \nCleveland's LeBron James has announced that he will be stumping for Hillary when she makes a stop in the crucial city in one of the most hotly contested battleground states in the country. James and Clinton will appear together at a get-out-the-vote rally at the Public Auditorium in Cleveland, Ohio in the late afternoon. This will be James's first appearance with Clinton. In fact, a source says, the two have never met. James  a hero to many Ohio sports fans, especially in the African American community  could prove helpful to Clinton's effort to win the state's 18 electoral votes. While Clinton is handily beating Donald Trump among African American voters, she is struggling to gin up enthusiasm. According to the 2010 census, 53 percent of Clevelanders are African American. \nThe stakes could not be higher. If Clinton can win Ohio, there is almost no scenario in which Trump can win. If Ohio goes for Trump, then he has a real shot of becoming president. As Ohio's biggest star (sorry, John Kasich), James has a lot of power to motivate people to get out and vote. It could be a difference-maker in a tight election. \nJames' decision to stump with Hillary comes after other big-name celebrities publicly expressed their support for her campaign. Just days ago, musical power couple Beyonce and Jay Z held a concert in support of Clinton. The star power has spooked Trump's campaign, as evidenced by the fact that they are claiming the celebrities backing Hillary give her an ※unfair§ advantage. Trump, a man who once okay'd a DJ calling his daughter a ※piece of ass§ and who bragged about grabbing women ※by the pussy,§ went so far as to lament the language used in some of Jay Z's songs. \n※He used every word in the book last night,§ Trump said. ※He used language last night that was so bad and then Hillary said, ＆I did not like Donald Trump's lewd language.' My lewd language. I tell you what, I've never said what he said in my life.§ \nEye roll. \nMeanwhile, in related news, Trump will be campaigning with his own star power tonight. The cream of the crop. The best of the best. The A-lister＃Ted Nugent. A man who once ※ joked § about shooting Hillary Clinton with a machine gun. \n※Obama, he's a piece of shit. I told him to suck on my machine gun. Hey Hillary,§ he continued. ※You might want to ride one of these into the sunset, you worthless bitch.§ \nYeah, Trump sure seems concerned about what language musicians use. \nFeatured image via Jamie Sabau/Getty Images Share this Article!",

    "text": "Rumors are circulating of who Donald Trump is considering to serve as his cabinet members if he wins on Tuesday, and the names on his list will chill you to the bone. \nAccording to several sources close to Trump, high ranking Republicans who have stood by the GOP nominee's side throughout the campaign have made the short list. Which means, of course, that he has chosen the worst of the worst. \nNBC reports : \n※Among the names being considered, according to conversations with three campaign advisers who requested anonymity to speak freely: Rudy Giuliani for attorney general, Newt Gingrich for secretary of state, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn for defense secretary or national security adviser, Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, and Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg for commerce secretary.§ \nReince Priebus, the current RNC chairman, is also being considered as a possibility to serve as Trump's chief of staff. He earned the favor of the bigoted billionaire by staunchly defending him time and time again when other Republicans were quick to jump ship. \n※They're thinking, ＆We need to find that balance between someone who knows how Washington works and someone who shakes things up,'§ the senior campaign adviser said. \nNBC points out that appointing Priebus as chief of staff would be ※an olive branch to the establishment,§ but it isn't clear at the moment if the RNC chair would even consider taking the position. \nOne veteran of the George W. Bush White House said that Trump's transition team had convinced him that they were looking for people to fill these positions that had ※experience§ in Washington. \n※They're reaching out to people with experience, they're listening to them, they're taking their counsel,§ the former official said. ※I was very impressed.§ \nThe NBC report did say that Trump really isn't putting the cart before the horse, so to speak. The sources they spoke to said the Trump campaign is ※focused on winning first and foremost as well and no decisions have been made or positions finalized.§ Trump campaign spokesman Hope Hicks said that ※none of this is accurate§ and added that Trump ※is entirely focused on the campaign and the American people.§ \nFeatured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images Share this Article!",

    "text": "By Jameson Parker Election 2016 , Politics November 10, 2016 Obama Just Did Something To Spite Trump On The President-Elect's Very First Visit To The White House   \nNobody is more disgusted and disappointed in the election results than President Barack Obama, whose legacy of progress is poised to be undone overnight by a belligerent con man. And apparently the first meeting between current and future presidents was off to a rocky start  culminating with Obama abruptly breaking with tradition and not giving Trump the satisfaction of a publicity win on this sad day. \nAccording to reporters at the White House , Obama cancelled a planned ※photo op§ with Trump shortly after meeting him, depriving the president-elect of the chance to appear alongside the current president and gain an air of legitimacy. \nThe Obamas canceled a photo-op of the current and future first couples outside the south entrance of the White House. In his first visit to the White House after the 2008 election, Mr. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama posed for the cameras alongside President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush. The decision not to participate in this tradition illustrates how bitter the campaign was, particularly for Mrs. Obama who delivered some of the most emotional arguments against electing Mr. Trump. \nIt may also suggest that Obama's first meeting with Trump went about as badly as expected. The president had hoped to press Trump on the importance of governing the country with a semblance of dignity, as well as making the case that spending his first day in office signing a bunch of executive orders to erase Obama's legacy out of spite would be a horrific start to his time in office. It appears that Trump was not in the a mood to listen. \nMr. Earnest said Mr. Obama would go through with Mr. Trump the policies he has implemented that he hopes his successor won't undo. But Mr. Trump is expected to attempt to unravel much of Mr. Obama's legacy, with plans to reverse his policies on health care, climate change, immigration and government regulations, and to dramatically shift his foreign-policy approach. \nThe fact that Obama would break this tradition  a symbolic gesture of the peaceful transition of power  implies he is keenly aware that the man about to take over is a walking, talking disaster. A pathological liar and narcissist who has surrounded himself with a team of goons that he can count on to tell him what he wants to here and claw their way up his coattails at every chance. No photo op is going to change this tragedy from unfolding. \nFeatured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images Share this Article!",

That's one thing y'all can take to the bank.§ \nMichelle Obama has become Hillary Clinton's most effective surrogate on the campaign trail this election season, delivering powerful speeches on behalf of the Democratic nominee whom she hopes will become her husband's successor. \nThe First Lady's success on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton has only led her supporters to push for her to launch her own political career, though she has long denied that she has any desire to run for political office. \nIndeed, it seems Michelle Obama is much more content living the high life, jet-setting around the world on expensive vacations, using only the most luxurious of accommodations, and paying for none of it herself. That's for the lowly taxpayers like you and me to do＃ \nWhy hold a job or work to curry favor with the American people when your lavish lifestyle has been handed to you on a silver platter? Considering this, it's really no surprise Michelle Obama does not wish to run for office after her husband's term is over, and for that, we are grateful. \nSHARE this report if you are glad to hear that Michelle Obama will not seek political office after she vacates the White House in the coming months＃ Haven't we had enough of her?!",

    "text": "0 comments \nThe Democrats are getting really nervous about Trump winning the election. They're trying to do everything that they can to tear him down even more than Hillary is already. Obama even went as far as to say that the KKK will return! \nPresident Barack Obama wants people in North Carolina to vote for Hillary Clinton, so he's warning them that Donald Trump would tolerate the support of the Klu Klux Klan if he's elected president. ※If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers 〞 the Klan 〞 and hesitate when asked about that support, then you'll tolerate that support when you're in office,§ he said. \nObama added that Trump would ※disrespect§ the Constitution as president, citing the Republican nominee's vow to put Hillary Clinton in jail. \n※[Y]ou threaten to throw your opponent in jail without any due process ＃ then imagine what you'll do when you actually have the power to violate the Constitution along those lines,§ Obama warned. \nObama made his remarks at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill on Wednesday, saying that the fate of the world rests on their shoulders. \n※I hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the Republic rests on your shoulders,§ he said as the audience laughed. ※The fate of the world is teetering, and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction.§ \nObama dismissed all of the negative ads and bad news that hurt Hillary Clinton as ※noise§ and ※distractions,§ that they should put aside. \n※Every day is just hysteria and over-the-top coverage,§ he said, admitting that even he was getting tired of politics. ※I understand the feeling, I promise you.§ \nHe argued that the choice for president was simple, because Trump was a con artist who was unfit and not ready to be president. \n※I mean, it's strange how, over time, what is crazy gets normalized,§ Obama said, referring to the multiple controversial statements made by Trump during the campaign. \n※That is not the voice of America. That's not the better angels of our nature,§ he said. \nIf you thought things couldn't get any more ridiculous, you're wrong. This accusation is taking things to a whole new level just days before voting. It's nothing but a desperate, pathetic plea for help. Related Items",

    "title": "There Might Be Consequences for the GOP Presidential Candidates Who Won't Endorse Donald Trump",
    "text": "Getty - Chip Somodevilla \nEach Republican presidential candidate had to pledge their support for the eventual GOP nominee when they filed their initial statement of intent to run and be placed on the ballot in the South Carolina primary, no matter what. But it remains unclear of what will happen for candidates who break that rule. \nWhen a candidate files to be on the ballot in South Carolina, they must write down their name and address before a signing below a paragraph that in part reads: \n※I hereby affirm that I generally believe in and intend to support the nominees and platform of the Republican Party in the November 8, 2016 general election...§ \nBut a handful of Republicans have opted out of that promise to endorse Donald Trump, including Ohio Governor John Kasich, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former New York Governor George Pataki and Sen. Lindsey Graham. In addition, businesswoman Carly Fiorina withdrew her previous endorsement of Trump. \nAnd if those candidates want to run again, they might face considerable hurdles in the Palmetto state, according to top Republican officials. \nSouth Carolina Republican Party chairman Matt Moore told Independent Journal Review that there are ※no definitive punishments related to South Carolina's pledge§ but that any candidate who refuses to back the nominee ※does so at their own political peril,§ adding: \n※The political consequences would be in the minds of the voters. I expect that anyone who runs in 2020 without supporting the nominee in 2016 will find themselves in difficult situation in South Carolina.§ \nHowever, the party could impose restrictions on candidates who violate the pledge, if they want. Moore said that while the South Carolina GOP's executive committee certainly has the authority to impose penalties, they have yet to meet on the subject. \nMore stern on the prospect of penalizing candidates who do not get on board with Trump was Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who said last month that the GOP is going to take a second look at how their members can launch presidential bids. \n※And if they're thinking they're going to run again someday, I think that we're going to evaluate the process,§ Priebus said. \"And I don't think it's going to be that easy for them.§ \nAs to whether or not the GOP can bar individuals from running on their primary ballots, University of South Carolina associate professor Ben Means told Independent Journal Review that ※political parties have a fair amount of discretion to control rights of participation,§ so it would not matter all that much that candidates breached the contract. \nThe South Carolina GOP could alter their rules to block the candidates from running again or they could absolve the disloyal candidates in the event of a catastrophic Trump loss. Either way, an evaluation of ballot access is in store for the Republican Party come November 9th.",

This bombs will kill me now. - Bana #Aleppo pic.twitter.com/KqVHwqRClK 〞 Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) October 2, 2016 \nUnlike many children, Bana doesn't go to school.

I use to play on it, now nowhere to play. - Bana #Aleppo pic.twitter.com/drWnwflSOE 〞 Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) October 4, 2016 \nAs you can see, life in Aleppo is a far cry from what many in the United States will ever experience. \nBana hopes that her message for President Barack Obama will be heard loud and clear. Instead of a plea for her personal safety, her request shows tremendous understanding of the broader picture and concern for all involved: \n※Stop [the] war and bring peace.§ \nPretty profound for a 7-year-old. \nBana has amassed a Twitter following of more than 77,000 people. When asked about having such a huge platform to share Aleppo's story, she gave the most humble and selfless response: \n※[I'm] very happy and good.

Wake up this morning alive. - Fatemah #Aleppo pic.twitter.com/EZz7xqbJ6E 〞 Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) October 3, 2016 \nBana possesses an innate ability to have faith in a situation that should give her every reason to doubt God's existence. \nThe 7-year-old admitted she believes in God, prays and said her faith has ※increased§ in light of her circumstances. \nBut she doesn't just pray for herself. She also said she prays every day for ※peace around the world.§ This is me before the war.

No, this isn't a set-up to an Airplane! punchline, this appears to be life under an imminent Hillary Clinton regime. \nIt turns out that Secretary of State is not really all about being the nation's chief diplomat and top foreign policy aide to the president, but is rather a cozy career path for Democratic politicians who want to pad their resumes. Who knew? \nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was an indisputable disaster. Leaving aside the clear violations with her private email server, which transmitted classified information , was potentially hacked , and put the nation's security at risk for Clinton's ※ convenience § here are a few more of her lowlights: \nCompletely misjudging the Arab Spring ※democratic§ movement \nGravely miscalculating with her ※reset§ policy and encouraging Russian aggression \nAssessing Bashar al-Assad as a ※ reformer ,§ overseeing a disastrous Syrian policy \nFailing to support the Iranian people during their freedom demonstration \nPushing to remove Gaddafi by force in Libya, only to leave it a failed state \nOverseeing a Middle Eastern policy that culminated in the rise of ISIS \nFailing to secure the Benghazi, Libya annex that was overrun by terrorists, leading to the death of four American servicement, then lying by blaming a Youtube video Image Credit: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images \nIt goes on and on. But it gets worse. The reigns at the State Department were turned over to Senator John Kerry, whose testimony on the Vietnam war is notorious on the right. Kerry's tenure has been nothing short of feckless and laughable. No, seriously. \nVladimir Putin, for example, is actually laughing at Kerry's useless protestations against Russia's backing of Assad. Kerry was also a vocal supporter of the Iranian nuclear deal, and he is satisfied that the deal will keep the mullahs on good behavior, despite their venomous hatred of the United States and lengthy track record of lying. \nThe icing on the cake for this stretch of Democratic career politicians taking over the helm at State will culminate with Hillary Clinton's whispered preference for the job with current Vice President Joe Biden. Image Credit: Mark Wilson/Getty Images \nAs reported by The Washington Examiner: \nVice President Joe Biden is at the top of the list for secretary of state if Hillary Clinton pulls out a win on Nov. 8. \nA source close to Clinton's transition team told Politico on Thursday evening that the Democratic nominee is already making serious considerations when it comes to who would be part of a Clinton 2.0 Cabinet. \nThe hilarious part? Biden himself seems to be oblivious to the potential nod. \nBiden himself is apparently unfamiliar with the news. Neither Clinton, a former secretary of state herself, nor her aides, have informed the former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman that he's most likely to oversee international affairs if she wins. \n※He'd be great, and they are spending a lot of time figuring out the best way to try to persuade him to do it if she wins,§ said the source familiar with the transition planning. \nThough many are in disbelief about the report, there is one very plausible reason to believe that Biden very well could spend his sunset years at the State Department: And that's the reward for not running. https://t.co/10DepJ4x9B 〞 Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) October 28, 2016 \nThat's just the way that Democrats roll, nowadays.",

    "title": "From Monster to Mr. President-Elect: Democrats Grovel Before Trump     : Information",
    "text": "From Monster to Mr. President-Elect: Democrats Grovel Before Trump By Andre Damon\nNovember 11, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" WSWS \" - Within a day of the election of Donald Trump, leading Democrats have moved with extraordinary speed to declare their support for the president-elect.\nPresident Barack Obama invited Trump to the White House for a friendly 90-minute meeting on Thursday. He declared afterwards that his ?number-one priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our president-elect is successful.? He added, speaking to Trump, ?I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-Elect, that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed?because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.?\nObama?s declaration stands in stark contrast to his own statements just a few days ago. Then he asserted that Trump ?appears to only care about himself? and ?doesn?t know basic facts that you?d need to know? to be president. He added that Trump ?spent 70 years on this earth showing no regard for working people.?\nThat was before the Democratic debacle on Election Day. Now he declares his highest priority to be ensuring that Trump is ?successful.?\nObama?s comments followed the statement by Hillary Clinton on Wednesday that she hoped ?[Trump] will be a successful president for all Americans.? Senator Bernie Sanders, the supposed socialist, issued his own groveling statement, declaring, ?To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him.?\nWith such declarations, the Democrats are in effect abandoning any pretense of acting as an opposition party to a President Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress.\nThe proclamations of support from top Democrats are made in relation to an individual whose election clearly marks a watershed in American politics. What is coming to power is a government of the extreme right, with fascistic characteristics. There are reports that Trump wants to appoint as his chief of staff Stephen Bannon, the head of Breitbart News, an ultra-right and fascistic media outlet. His top advisors and likely cabinet appointees include reactionary figures such as former New York Mayor Rudolf Giuliani and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.\nIn their rush to lend the transition of power an aura of normalcy, the Democrats and the media have maintained a studious silence about certain quite striking elements of the election.\nNo one is noting that a principal factor in the election of Trump was a significant decline in voter turnout. For all of the media talk of a ?surge? of white working class voters behind Trump, the Republican candidate actually received one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney received in losing the 2012 election to Obama. Clinton won 6 million fewer votes than Obama won in his reelection, when the outgoing president obtained significantly fewer votes than he had received in 2008. Also virtually ignored is the extraordinary fact that Trump failed even to win the popular vote. Clinton had a higher percentage of the national vote, but she lost in the Electoral College, which involves a complex and antidemocratic apportionment based on victories in individual states. Trump will take office having failed to secure a plurality, let alone a majority, of the overall vote.\nIn the entire 240-year history of the United States, there have been only five elections in which the incoming president did not win the popular vote. When this happened in 1876, the Republican, Rutherford B. Hayes, became president, though he had fewer votes than the Democrat, Samuel J. Tilden. The political conflict over the outcome was so intense that the Republicans were able to hold the White House only after agreeing to the effective end of post-Civil War Reconstruction, through the withdrawal of federal troops from the South.\nAfter a split vote in 1888, when Grover Cleveland lost to Benjamin Harrison, the winner of the Electoral Vote was also the winner of the popular vote for the next 112 years. In the 21st century, this anomaly has now happened twice?in 2000 and again in 2016. In the former case, the selection of George W. Bush as president required the intervention of the Supreme Court to halt the recount of ballots in Florida.\nHad Trump found himself in the position of Clinton, he would have taken his time before conceding. His concession speech, when and if it came, would have stressed that he had won the popular vote and that ?Crooked Hillary? could not claim a mandate.\nThe media message would have stressed the need for Clinton to be conciliatory and acknowledge that the majority of the voters had chosen Trump. One can easily imagine CNN announcing the ?breaking news? that Clinton had withdrawn the nomination of Obama?s choice for the Supreme Court and invited the Republicans to name the replacement for the deceased Antonin Scalia.\nBut the Democrats have done just the opposite.\nWhat is behind this universal about-face? President Obama said perhaps more than he intended when he declared Wednesday that ?we have to remember that we?re actually all on one team. This is an intramural scrimmage??that is, a test competition involving players from the same school.\nThe United States does not really have an oppositional political system. The divisions between the Democrats and Republicans, and between Clinton and Trump, are of an entirely tactical character. They all defend the same basic interests?those of the corporate and financial aristocracy that controls the political system.\nWithin this framework, the Democrats are always the more accommodating and conciliatory party, since their rhetorical references to defending the interests of working people?including by the likes of Bernie Sanders?are thoroughly vacuous and insincere. In relation to Trump and the dangers he poses, there is an element of complete complacency, which arises from the fact that the danger is not to the Democrats or the privileged social forces for which they speak, but to the working class.\nThe chief concern of the Democrats is to contain popular anger. Their moves to circle the wagons around Trump are above all a response to the danger they see of the emergence of popular opposition that threatens not only the incoming government, but the capitalist system itself.\nEven as Obama, Clinton, Sanders and company prostrate themselves and pledge their loyalty to Trump, thousands of youth and workers are demonstrating around the country against the president-elect. These protests are only a pale and politically disparate foretaste of mass struggles of the working class that are to come.\nWhat is critical is that the lessons of the 2016 election be drawn and all attempts to keep opposition to war and austerity chained to the political corpse of the Democratic Party be rejected. The task is not to ?take back? the Democratic Party or push it to the left?the inevitable result of that false perspective has already been demonstrated in the reactionary outcome of the Sanders campaign?but to break with both parties of big business and all forms of capitalist politics and build an independent socialist and internationalist movement of the working class.\nCopyright ? 1998-2016 World Socialist Web Site - All rights reserved",

    "title": "President Trump Has Shattered Jews' American Idyll      : Information",
    "text": "Trump Camp Accused Of Anti-Semitism President Trump Has Shattered Jews' American Idyll November 14, \" Haaretz \" - American Jews have transformed virtually overnight from insiders to outsiders; the appointment of ex-Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon, an accused anti-Semite, as chief strategist, is bound to exacerbate the tensions.\nBy Chemi Shalev WASHINGTON ? Those were the best of times, arguably, but these may be the worst of times. That?s the way most American Jews must feel as they wake up with a massive hangover from the shock election results and the reality that Donald Trump will soon be President of the United States.\nWhatever differences American Jews may have had with Barack Obama over the Iran nuclear deal and Middle East peace, they?ve never had a president who was more in tune with their Jewish and liberal essence.\nObama was the realization of the American Jewish vision of a multicultural society, a dream come true for a generation of civil rights activists. He promoted and embodied the liberal ideals that American Jews are more attached to than any other religious group in America. And he was more knowledgeable about American Jewish culture and Yiddishkeit than any previous president, bar none. Even when they disagreed with him, most American Jews, with the exception of the vocal minority that hated his guts, viewed Obama as a mensch.\nIt is probably no coincidence that during his tenure, American Jews reached a pinnacle of social and cultural acceptance. Being American Jews was hip. It was cool. It was the thing to be. From Jon Stewart to Jerry Seinfeld, from Joe Lieberman to Bernie Sanders, Jews seemed to be more entrenched than ever before in the American mainstream. Pew Research Polls repeatedly confirmed that Jews were the most loved and most admired religious group in all of America. Mashiach-zeit, old timers would say, but with a note of caution, because if Jewish history teaches anything, it is that all things must pass.\nThe election of Donald Trump has shattered the Jewish idyll, all across the board. Although one must give the president-elect the benefit of the doubt that he is not an anti-Semite himself, he has frequently promoted disparaging Jewish stereotypes in his personal statements. Sunday evening?s appointment of former Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon as chief strategist in the White House is bound to exacerbate Jewish tensions. He is considered the standard bearer for the racist, anti-immigrant alt-right movement and has been accused of harboring anti-Semitic sentiments himself.\nTrump has repeatedly and unapologetically disseminated white supremacist tweets. His campaign has used anti-Semitic symbols that Trump has failed to disown even when advised of their offensive content. He has distanced himself from his neo-Nazi supporters only under duress. And under his wings, America has seen an unprecedented outburst of blunt and naked hatred of Jews, which has only gotten worse since his election.\nIn recent months, most prominent Jewish journalists and other public critics of Trump have been harassed by anti-Semites on social media, in their mail at home and, in some cases, in close physical contact. Swastikas have been painted at schools. Jewish students have been threatened, taunted, told that Adolf Hitler was right all along. Along with Muslims, Hispanics, and African Americans, they are being targeted as the sworn enemies of the America First Weltanschauung that Trump is bringing with him to the White House.\nThe shock that many Jews are feeling now is partly of their making. In recent years, the American Jewish establishment has willingly enlisted in the Israeli government?s effort to depict ever-widening circles of anti-Israeli agitation on the left as anti-Semitism. The fight against BDS and the efforts to portray it as hatred of Jews in another form has consumed the time, energy and resources of the American Jewish leadership, with the possible exception of the Anti-Defamation League.\nMeanwhile, virulent and classic anti-Semitism lurking just under the radical right?s surface was virtually ignored, concealed by the mainstream right-wing?s overwhelming support for Israel. Even mentioning it was considered to be an anti-Israeli provocation.\nTrump?s triumph has unleashed the pent up resentment against Jews. His reluctance to tackle manifestations of racism and white supremacism among his supporters has energized and empowered it. If he and his advisers don?t take assertive steps soon, anti-Jewish agitators will feel they have a license from the White House to do as they please. They will get bolder, grow stronger, recruit new adherents and increasingly resort to violence: we?ve seen it before.\nBut even if brazen anti-Semitic incidents are quelled or die down by themselves, there is no denying that Jews have transformed virtually overnight from insiders to outsiders. Not only did they vote overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, prominent conservative Jews who could have allayed their concerns are the ones who have distanced themselves from Trump over the course of the campaign and will play no role in his administration.\nAmerican Jewish liberals are bound to feel alienated from their own government in way they?ve never felt before. Most of the values, goals and policy objectives of the Trump administration, even if they turn out to be a paler and more palatable version of his campaign rhetoric, are diametrically opposed to those of most American Jews. They support immigration, pluralism, multiculturalism, social reform, government intervention, separation of church and state, gay marriage, abortion rights and on and on. It is easy to see, in fact, why so many of Trump?s radical supporters would view the Jews as their mortal enemies.\nAs Shmuel Rosner rightly points out for the wrong reasons, Trump may ultimately divide Israeli and American Jews. But the reason for that is not limited, as Rosner asserts, to the yet to be proven assumption that American Jews will resent their Israeli counterparts for liking Trump because he is pro-Israel. It is because Trump?s core message, his reactionary, nativist, chauvinistic, anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant and mainly anti-Muslim worldview is shared by far too many, though far from all Israelis, and is embraced by its ruling coalition. And because many Israeli Jews are indifferent to right-wing anti-Semitism and indeed share right-wing disdain toward the liberalism of American Jews.\nOf course, all may not be bleak. Perhaps Trump will fight the anti-Semitism on his radical fringe with increasing vigor. Possibly his policies will be less offensive to American Jews. Perhaps the American Jewish establishment will produce a leadership capable of meeting these trying times. Who knows, maybe some American Jews will finally realize they should support Israeli Jews who share their worldview rather than a government that doesn?t.\nAnd if worse comes to worst, to paraphrase Casablanca, liberal American Jews will always have Israel itself. Moderate, liberal Israelis, beleaguered and on the point of despair, will flock to the airport to welcome them with open arms. Mashiach-zeit, they will tell themselves, in awe. ?

    "text": "President-Elect Donald Trump's First Televised Interview Video CBS 60 Minutes Trump Talks Wall, Deportations, Roe v. Wade, and Clinton?s Future in 60 Minutes Interview. November 14, 2016 Audio\nLesley Stahl: Well, congratulations, Mr. Trump.\nDonald Trump: Thank you.\nLesley Stahl: You?re president-elect.\nDonald Trump: Thank you.\nLesley Stahl: How surprised were you?\nDonald Trump: Well, I really felt we were doing well. I was on a string of about 21 straight days of speeches, sometimes many a day and the last two days I really-- I really had a pretty wild time. I did six speeches and then I did seven and--\nLesley Stahl: But everyone thought you were going to lose.\nDonald Trump: I know, I did my final speech in Michigan at 1:00 in the morning and we had 31,000 people, many people outside of the arena. And I felt-- when I left, I said, ?How are we gonna lose?? We set it up a day before. And we had all of these people. And it was literally at 1:00 in the morning and I said, ?This doesn?t look like second place.? So we were really happy, I mean, it was-- these are great people.\nLesley Stahl: On election night, I heard you went completely silent. Was it a sort of realization of the enormity of this thing for you?\n Donald Trump: I think so, it?s enormous. I?ve done a lotta big things, I?ve never done anything like this. It is so big, it is so-- it?s so enormous, it?s so amazing.\n Lesley Stahl: It kind of just took your breath away? Couldn?t talk?\nDonald Trump: A li-- a little bit, a little bit. And I think-- I realized that this is a whole different life for me now.\nLesley Stahl: Hillary called you. Tell us about that phone call.\nDonald Trump: So Hillary called and it was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her, I mean, I can imagine. Tougher for her than it would have been for me. And for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldn?t have been nicer. She just said, ?Congratulations, Donald, well done.? And I said, ?I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor.? She is very strong and very smart.\nLesley Stahl: What about Bill Clinton? Did you talk to him?\nDonald Trump: He did, he called the next day.\nLesley Stahl: Really? What did he say?\nDonald Trump: He actually called last night.\nLesley Stahl: What did he say?\nDonald Trump: And he-- he couldn?t have been more gracious. He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing he?s ever seen.\nLesley Stahl: He said that.\nDonald Trump: He was very, very-- really, very nice.\nLesley Stahl: It was a pretty nasty campaign. Do you regret any of the things you said about her?\nDonald Trump: Well, it was a double-side nasty.\nDonald Trump: I mean they were tough and I was tough and-- do I regret? I mean, I?m sitting here with you now and we?re gonna do a great job for the country. We?re going to make America great again, I mean, that?s what-- it-- it began with that and that?s where we are right now. There are so many--\nLesley Stahl: So no-- no regrets about--\nDonald Trump: I can?t regret. No-- I wish it were softer, I wish it were nicer, I wish maybe even it was more on policy, or whatever you want to say. But-- but I will say that-- it really-- it really is something that I?m very proud of I mean it was a tremendous campaign.\nLesley Stahl: Can we talk about yesterday with President Obama?\nDonald Trump: Sure.\nLesley Stahl: 90 minutes. You were scheduled for what? 15?\nDonald Trump: 15 max.\n[Barack Obama: We talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy.]\nDonald Trump: This was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half. And it could have gone on for four hours. I mean it was-- just-- in fact, it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say. And he told me-- the good things and the bad things, there are things that are tough right now--\nLesley Stahl: Like what?\nDonald Trump: Well\nLesley Stahl: Give us some meat.\nDonald Trump: Well, look I don?t want to divulge, but we talked about the Middle East, that?s tough. It?s a tough situation. I wanted to get his full view and I got his, you know I got a good part of his view.\nLesley Stahl: Uh-huh.\nDonald Trump: And I like having that because I?m going to be inheriting that in a short period of time. I found him to be terrific. I found him to be-- very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects.\nDonald Trump:?and we were talking about some victories, also, some things that-- that he feels very good about. But--\nLesley Stahl: Like--\nDonald Trump: Well, what I really wanted to focus on was-- the Middle East, North Korea, Obamacare is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation.\nLesley Stahl: Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it.\nDonald Trump: Well, he didn?t ask me, no, he told me-- you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that.\nLesley Stahl: You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you or--\nDonald Trump: No, I think I?m a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I?m not. I?m actually not. I?m a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we had-- we had a very good chemistry going. And-- and I really found?it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting.\n[Barack Obama: I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed then the country succeeds.]\nLesley Stahl: Was it at all awkward, at all, given what you?ve said about each other? You said he was not born in this country, he said things about you, he said you?re-- unqualified--\nDonald Trump: You know what, it was a very-- it was a very interesting thing because-- I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like?\nLesley Stahl: Yeah.\nDonald Trump: We never discussed what was said about each other. I said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. We never ever discussed what we said about each other?\nLesley Stahl: There was no awkwardness?\nDonald Trump: I?ll be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And that?s strange. I?m actually surprised to tell you that. It?s-- you know, a little bit strange.\n[Donald Trump: Thank you, sir.]\nLesley Stahl: Do you think that-- that your election is a repudiation of his presidency?\nDonald Trump: No, I think it?s a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. They?ve let ?em down on the job front. They?ve even let ?em down in terms of the war front. You know, we?ve been fighting this war for 15 years--\nLesley Stahl: This was the message of your campaign.\nDonald Trump: We?ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the-- and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of what?s been taking place over a longer period of time than that.\nLesley Stahl: You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16, whatever-- people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president?\nDonald Trump: You know, I?ll conduct myself-- in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look at-- when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, it?s going to be America first. It?s not going to be what we?re doing?we, we?ve lost-- we?re losing this country. We?re losing this country. That?s why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big.\n Lesley Stahl: Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in?\n Donald Trump: Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I don?t want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be.\nLesley Stahl: Can you be?\nDonald Trump: Sure I can. I can be easily, that?s easier. Honestly to do that, it?s easier.\nLesley Stahl: So let?s go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you?re going to do what you said or you?re going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall?\n Donald Trump: Yes.\nLesley Stahl: They?re talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?\nDonald Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I?m very good at this, it?s called construction.\nLesley Stahl: So part wall, part fence?\nDonald Trump: Yeah, it could be ? it could be some fencing.\nLesley Stahl: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?\nDonald Trump: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we?re getting them out of our country, they?re here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we?re going to make a determination on the people that you?re talking about who are terrific people, they?re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley, it?s very important, we want to secure our border.\n[Paul Ryan: We had a fantastic, productive meeting.]\nLesley Stahl: So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was the-- one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away?\nDonald Trump: Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. We?re going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes--\nLesley Stahl: And you?ve got both Houses?\nDonald Trump: And I have both Houses and we have the presidency, so we can do things--\nLesley Stahl: You can do things lickety-split.\nDonald Trump: It?s been a long time since it?s happened.\nDonald Trump: And they gave me a lot of credit. Don?t forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going to-- instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed.\nLesley Stahl: You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money.\nDonald Trump: Yeah.\nLesley Stahl: You admitted you used to do it yourself. You have a transition team?\nDonald Trump: And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests.\n Lesley Stahl: And you want to get rid of all of that?\n Donald Trump: I don?t like it, no.\n Lesley Stahl: You don?t like it, but your own transition team, it?s filled with lobbyists.\n Donald Trump: That?s the only people you have down there.\n Lesley Stahl: You have lobbyists from Verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby.\nDonald Trump: Sure. Everybody?s a lobbyist down there--\n Lesley Stahl: Well, wait\n Donald Trump: That?s what they are. They?re lobbyists or special interests?\nLesley Stahl: On your own transition team.\n Donald Trump:?we are trying to clean up Washington. Look--\n Lesley Stahl: How can you claim--\n Donald Trump: Everything, everything down there-- there are no people-- there are all people that work -- that?s the problem with the system, the system. Right now, we?re going to clean it up. We?re having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we?re going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren?t happy about, but we?re putting on term limits. We?re doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.\nLesley Stahl: But you?re, but you?re basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them?\nDonald Trump: I?m saying that they know the system right now, but we?re going to phase that out. You have to phase it out.\n Lesley Stahl: Let?s talk about your cabinet.\n Donald Trump: OK.\n Lesley Stahl: Have you made any decisions?\n Donald Trump: Yes.\nLesley Stahl: Tell us.\nDonald Trump: Well, I can?t tell you that, but I have made--\nLesley Stahl: Oh, come on?\nDonald Trump: You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. First of all, every major leader and probably less than major le- has called me, I?ve spoken to many of them and I?ll call the rest of them, but and I said, ?Boy, this really shows you how powerful our country is.? France and U.K. and I mean everybody, all over Asia?and very, just to congratulate. But it really shows the power of our country.\nLesley Stahl: One of the things you?re going to obviously get an opportunity to do, is name someone to the Supreme Court. And I assume you?ll do that quickly?\nDonald Trump: Yes. Very important.\nLesley Stahl: During the campaign, you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights. Will you appoint-- are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade?\nDonald Trump: So look, here?s what?s going to happen-- I?m going to-- I?m pro-life. The judges will be pro-life. They?ll be very?\nLesley Stahl: But what about overturning this law--\nDonald Trump: Well, there are a couple of things. They?ll be pro-life, they?ll be-- in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody?s talking about the Second Amendment and they?re trying to dice it up and change it, they?re going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and--\n Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but then some women won?t be able to get an abortion?\n Donald Trump: No, it?ll go back to the states.\nLesley Stahl: By state?no some --\n Donald Trump: Yeah.\n Donald Trump: Yeah, well, they?ll perhaps have to go, they?ll have to go to another state.\n Lesley Stahl: And that?s OK?\nDonald Trump: Well, we?ll see what happens. It?s got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.\n Lesley Stahl: Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what you?re taking on?\n Donald Trump: No.\n Lesley Stahl: Not at all?\n Donald Trump: I respect it. But I?m not scared by it.\nLesley Stahl: Now you?re not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your rhetoric--\nDonald Trump: That?s only because they don?t know me. I really believe that?s only because--\nLesley Stahl: Well, they listened to you in the campaign and that?s--\nDonald Trump: I just don?t think they know me.\n Lesley Stahl: Well, what do you think they?re demonstrating against?\nDonald Trump: Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had it-- if you look at WikiLeaks, we had--\n Lesley Stahl: You think those people down there are?\n Donald Trump: Well Lesley?\n Lesley Stahl: are professional?\n Donald Trump: Oh, I think some of them will be professional, yeah--\nLesley Stahl: OK, but what about ? they?re in every city.\nLesley Stahl: When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, I mean, don?t you say to yourself, I guess you don?t, you know, do I have to worry about this? Do I have to go out and assuage them? Do I have to tell them not to be afraid? They?re afraid.\n Donald Trump: I would tell them don?t be afraid, absolutely.\nLesley Stahl: But that?s not what you?re saying, I said it-\n Donald Trump: Oh, I think, no, no, I think-- I am saying it, I?ve been saying it.\n Lesley Stahl: OK.\nDonald Trump: Don?t be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don?t be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, ?Oh, that?s a terrible thing.? And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here.\nIt has been five full days since the election and anti-Trump demonstrations, driven in part by Hillary Clinton?s edge in the popular vote, have been significant.\nWhen we interviewed him on Friday afternoon Mr. Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name or against his supporters.\nNor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans, Latinos and gays by some of his supporters.\nDonald Trump: I am very surprised to hear that-- I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that--\nLesley Stahl: But you do hear it?\nDonald Trump: I don?t hear it?I saw, I saw one or two instances\nLesley Stahl: On social media?\nDonald Trump: But I think it?s a very small amount. Again, I think it?s--\nLesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people?\nDonald Trump: I would say don?t do it, that?s terrible, ?cause I?m gonna bring this country together.\n Lesley Stahl: They?re harassing Latinos, Muslims--\nDonald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, ?Stop it.? If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.\nDuring the campaign Mr. Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton?s email issue.\nSo we asked him if he plans to carry that out.\nThat part of the interview and a discussion with the next first lady, Melania Trump, when we come back.\nOn Friday, Donald Trump announced that he was changing the head of his transition team. Governor Chris Christie was replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Trump also added his three older children to the transition team.\nBetween now and Inauguration Day, the team must fill the new administration with 4,000 political appointees. That?s 4,000 new hires in just nine weeks.\nWhen we talked to Donald Trump on Friday, the enormity and gravity of his new role was just sinking in. He was subdued. We wondered if as president he planned to temper his rhetoric, lower the flame.\nLesley Stahl: I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, I think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators.\nDonald Trump: Yeah.\nLesley Stahl: You said that they were professionals?and you said it was unfair.\nDonald Trump: I said some of them. Some of them are --\nLesley Stahl: But are you going to be tweeting and whatever you?re upset about just put out there when you?re president?\nDonald Trump: So it?s a modern form of communication, between Face-- you know, Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram, I have 28 million people. 28 million people--\nLesley Stahl: So you are going to keep it up?\nDonald Trump: It?s a great form of communication. Now, do I say I?ll give it up entirely and throw out, that?s a tremendous form-- I pick up-- I?m picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. I?m not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, ?cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. That?s very tough--\nLesley Stahl: But you?re going to do that as president?\nDonald Trump: I?m going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I?m going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It?s a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It?s-- it?s where it?s at. I-- I do believe this, I really believe that, um-- the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they?re spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.\nLesley Stahl: Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail?\nDonald Trump: Well, I?ll tell you what I?m going to do, I?m going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we?ve been talking about.\nLesley Stahl: You-- you know, you--\nDonald Trump: And get the country straightened away.\nLesley Stahl: You called her ?crooked Hillary,? said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, ?Lock em? up.?\nDonald Trump: Yeah. She did--\nLesley Stahl: Do you?\nDonald Trump: She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things--\nLesley Stahl: I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might\nDonald Trump: I don?t want to hurt them. I don?t want to hurt them. They?re, they?re good people. I don?t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.\nWith that\n[Donald Trump: You look great, honey.]\nWe were joined by the next first lady, Melania Trump. She?ll be only the second foreign-born first lady. She?s from Slovenia. John Quincy Adams? wife Louisa was the first.\nLesley Stahl: You know, I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead. The enormity. You?re about to be first lady. Are you a little nervous about it? Little tense? A little--\nMelania Trump: Well, there is a lot of responsibilities. And it?s-- a lot of work needs to be done. And-- it?s-- your-- stuff on your shoulders. And-- we will take care of it-- day by day. I will stay true to myself. I?m very strong and um-- tough and confident. And I will listen myself and I will do what is right and what feels to my heart.\nLesley Stahl: What kind of a first lady do you think she?s going to be?\nDonald Trump: She will be terrific. She is very strong and very confident, but she?s very warm. And I think she?ll have a platform where she?ll really be able to do a lot of good. And that?s what she wants to do.\nLesley Stahl: You know, first ladies usually have a cause. And you?ve already said you?re interested in speaking out against bullying on social media.\nMelania Trump: I think it?s very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt. And we need to teach them how to talk to each other, how to treat each other and to, to be able to connect with each other on the right way.\nIt?s an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign.\nLesley Stahl: What about your husband?s tweeting?\nMelania Trump: Well, sometimes he-- it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following.\nLesley Stahl: So you never say to him, ?Come on??\nMelania Trump: I did.\nDonald Trump: She does--\nMelania Trump: I--\nMelania Trump: You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But\nLesley Stahl: Does he listen to you?\nMelania Trump: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn?t--\nDonald Trump: I?m not a big tweeter. I mean, I don?t do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across.\nLesley Stahl: If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him?\nMelania Trump: Yes, I tell him all the time.\nLesley Stahl: All the time?\nMelania Trump: All the time.\nLesley Stahl: And does--\nMelania Trump: And--\nLesley Stahl: --he listen? Does he--\nMelania Trump: I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. He?s an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it.\nLesley Stahl: Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval?\nDonald Trump: Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way he?s affected every bit as much. Maybe more.\nLesley Stahl: Maybe more.\nDonald Trump: And so we all had a dinner and I said, ?I would like to do this. I think I can do a great job.? And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed.\nLesley Stahl: Your son Barron, what is he, 10?\nMelania Trump: 10.\nLesley Stahl: 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know?\nMelania Trump: He knows. He knows--\nLesley Stahl: He knows?\nMelania Trump: --what?s going on. And, he?s very proud of his dad.\nLesley Stahl: Now-- you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness, given--\nMelania Trump: No.\nLesley Stahl: --what everybody was saying about everybody in the campaign?\nMelania Trump: No. I didn?t feel it.\nLesley Stahl: Not at all?\nMelania Trump: No.\nLesley Stahl: Tell us about the meeting.\nMelania Trump: Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice.\nLesley Stahl: You know, she raised the two kids in the White House. But she had her mother living there. That?s an enormous help. Your parents are here, right?\nMelania Trump: They?re here.\nLesley Stahl: Will they go to Washington with you?\nMelania Trump: They might. We will see. We will discuss that.\nLesley Stahl: Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hair?s out of place. Are you both prepared for this?\nMelania Trump: We are used to it.\nDonald Trump: I will say, it is on a different scale now, ?cause I?ve had a lot. But I?ve never had anything like this.\nLesley Stahl: You won?t be able to walk down the street--\nMelania Trump: I didn?t do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It?s another level, but it will continue.\nAt that point, the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues Mr. Trump faces.\nLesley Stahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation?\nDonald Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don?t-- I haven?t made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think --\nLesley Stahl: Even though they leak so much?\nDonald Trump: Well, there?s been a lotta leaking, there?s no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I?d answer a question like that.\nLesley Stahl: Sounds like you?re not sure.\nDonald Trump: Well, sure, I?m not sure. I?d wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did.\nLesley Stahl: Are you gonna release your tax returns?\nDonald Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I?m under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn?t care because I won the election very easily. So they don?t care. I never thought they did care.\nLesley Stahl: Now, for months, you were running around saying that the system is rigged, the whole thing was rigged. You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracy.\nDonald Trump: I do.\nLesley Stahl: So do you still think it?s rigged?\nDonald Trump: Well, I think the electoral ca-- look, I won with the Electoral College.\nLesley Stahl: Exactly.But do you think--\nDonald Trump: You know, it?s--\nLesley Stahl: --it?s rigged?\nDonald Trump: Yeah, some of the election locations are. Some of the system is. I hated--\nLesley Stahl: Even though you won you?re saying that--\nDonald Trump: I hated-- well, you know, I?m not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There?s a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and there?s something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system.\nLesley Stahl: What about vacations? You?re not going to take any vacations? You?ve said that.\nDonald Trump: We have so much work. There?s so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. We?re lowering taxes, we?re taking care of health care. I mean, there?s just so much to be done. So I don?t think we?ll be very big on vacations, no.\nLesley Stahl: Are you gonna take the salary, the president?s salary?\nDonald Trump: Well, I?ve never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I?ll take $1 a year. But it?s a -- I don?t even know what it is.\nDonald Trump: Do you know what the salary is?\nLesley Stahl: $400,000 you?re giving up.\nDonald Trump: No, I?m not gonna take the salary. I?m not taking it.\nIn a moment, the Trump children join us and we will ask the president-elect where he stands on gay marriage, Obamacare, and ISIS.\nOn Tuesday, Donald Trump reached deep into America?s ranks of the discouraged and neglected, a largely white constituency. They feel their America hasn?t been great for a long time. And they accepted a promise to make it great again.\nBut Mr. Trump?s appeal wasn?t just to the disaffected. A map on election night was a sea of red, as he won support across the traditionally Republican South, but also deep into what used to be the blue wall of the Midwest.\nHillary Clinton came up short among her own supporters in large cities and affluent suburbs, among minorities and especially women. Just 51 percent of college-educated white women voted to make her the first female president. Her base didn?t come with the enthusiasm and the turnout she needed to fend off Donald Trump?s new and energized coalition.\nOn Friday Mr. Trump?s four older children ? Tiffany, Donald, Jr., Eric And Ivanka -- joined us to talk about their father?s surprising victory.\nLesley Stahl: Set the scene. It?s election night. Your father-- no one?s expecting him to win and it begins to dawn on you. Tell us about being in that room.\nEric Trump: You start to see the states falling. You start seeing Florida come in and he was declared the winner. And then you saw Ohio, you saw North Carolina. You saw Pennsylvania. You saw Wisconsin. I mean, you saw all these great states ? they?re all falling. And I think it was when we got Pennsylvania that we knew. And it was amazing. We were high fiving and we were all hugging as a family. And I actually think our father was the calmest of all of us even though he was really obviously the center of attention. So--\nLesley Stahl: He went quiet is what I heard.\nEric Trump: --it?s-- it?s--\nLesley Stahl: --is what I heard.\nEric Trump: --it?s a moment I?ll never forget, I can tell you that. I mean, the team was around and everybody?s cheering. And it was just-- it was-- it was a beautiful night.\nIvanka Trump: It is hard to put into words the experience or the emotion when your father becomes president of the United States of America. We had enormous pride, joy. It?s incredibly exciting. And we?re very grateful for the opportunity. And we take that opportunity very seriously.\nLesley Stahl: Tiffany?\nTiffany Trump: I mean I don?t think we can really prepare for our father becoming president. But we were all there together with everyone that?s worked so hard. And my dad has worked so hard. And it?s just ? it?s really awe-inspiring.\nAt some point that night and into the next day, calls from well-wishers started pouring in ? including, Mr. Trump told us, from both ex-presidents Bush. Neither of whom supported him in the campaign.\nLesley Stahl: What did the b=Bushes say when they called you?\nDonald Trump: Well, it was very interesting. I got a call from Father Bush, who is a wonderful man. And he just said, ?Congratulations. It",

    "text": "Pete Souza/WhiteHouse.gov Will the Establishment elite allow Trump to take the presidency on Jan. 20, 2017? \nWASHINGTON D.C. ( INTELLIHUB ) 〞 The Establishment elite are in panic mode after their rigged elections backfired in their face when vast seas of patriotic Americans took to the polls in favor of Donald J. Trump, giving America's new President-elect the electoral votes needed to win. \nLast Thursday, during a meeting held at the White House, between Donald Trump and President Barack Obama, you could just see how irked Obama was knowing that he was sitting beside a truly patriotic soul; a man with a raging fire burning inside him; a man with the spirit to facilitate making America great again. Not to mention Trump was the man that brought Obama's birth certificate issue to the forefront. The look on @POTUS face when he met @realDonaldTrump #priceless \n〞 Shepard Ambellas (@ShepardAmbellas) November 12, 2016 \nIn fact, during the meeting Obama was so threatened by Trump's presence that his 8-year-long legacy likely flashed before his very eyes as the President of the United States realized that on day number one of Donald Trump's presidency, a president Trump, at that point, could simply nullify any and all executive orders signed by the then would-be former president Barack Obama during his tenure as POTUS . What will happen if Trump nullifies all of Obama's executive orders once POTUS? Ted Eytan/Flickr Does this mean no more ＆transgender bathrooms?' \nAbsolutely. Imagine that; a normal world, how it always was for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Naval History & Heritage Command/Flickr Does that mean Americans can keep their guns? \nSure does. America would not be America if we did not have the right to bear arms and work to undo what anti-gunners have done in Washington D.C. over the past two decades and what Obama has done over the past 8-years against the U.S. Constitution . Fibonacci Blue/Flickr Does that mean the repeal of Obamacare or major failed portions of it? \nYes it does. Does that mean the preservation of our civil rights and liberties per the Constitution? \nSure does. Does that mean implementing a sensible immigration policy; possibly building a wall? \nYes it does. After all, the Russians are now using advanced killer robots at their border, ones that can engage and kill humans from over 6 miles away. Nancy <I'm gonna SNAP!/Flickr Does that mean putting an end to dangerous geoengineering programs that our affecting all living things on the planet and our weather? \nOne can only hope. \nBut you can see where I am going with this. The Establishment elite simply do not want to lose their power and in my opinion will likely do anything to keep it. Remember, they have built a legacy and plan to protect it at all costs. \nSo in other words; will Donald Trump actually take office against all odds? \nPlease comment below and share your opinion on this highly important issue. \nShepard Ambellas is an opinion journalist, filmmaker , radio talk show host and the founder and editor-in-chief of Intellihub News & Politics.

    "title": "President Obama leaves behind a deplorable civil liberties legacy",
    "text": "VIDEOS President Obama leaves behind a deplorable civil liberties legacy An article published yesterday highlighted some of the extremely illiberal policies perpetrated by so-called ※liberal§ champion, Barack Obama By Michael Krieger - Tuesday, November 15, 2016 8:48 AM EST \nMore disappointing than the Obama administration itself (which was very disappointing), were the seemingly endless hordes of fake liberals constantly justifying and making excuses for his well documented litany of civil liberties abuses. Naturally, I likewise expect countless Trump supporters to instinctively make similar excuses for Trump if he should end up naming former Goldman Sachs Partner, and overall finance miscreant , Steve Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary. This is a huge part of our problem as a nation. Rather than having well defined principles and defending them, we tend to pick personalities we like and then cheer them on as uncritically as our favorite sports teams. \nMoving along, a New York Times article published yesterday highlighted some of the extremely illiberal policies perpetrated by so-called ※liberal§ champion, Barack Obama. \nHere are a few key excerpts: Over and over, Mr. Obama has imposed limits on his use of such powers but has not closed the door on them 〞 a flexible approach premised on the idea that he and his successors could be trusted to use them prudently. Mr. Trump can now sweep away those limits and open the throttle on policies that Mr. Obama endorsed as lawful and legitimate for sparing use, like targeted killings in drone strikes and the use of indefinite detention and military tribunals for terrorism suspects. And even in areas where Mr. Obama tried to terminate policies from the George W. Bush era 〞 like torture and the detention of Americans and other people arrested on domestic soil as ※enemy combatants§ 〞 his administration fought in court to prevent any ruling that the defunct practices had been illegal. The absence of a definitive repudiation could make it easier for Trump administration lawyers to revive the policies by invoking the same sweeping theories of executive power that were the basis for them in the Bush years. Two decisions by Mr. Obama in 2009 set the tone for his leave-it-on-the-table approach. They involved whether to keep indefinite wartime detentions without trial and to continue using military commission prosecutions 〞 if not at the Guantnamo prison, which he had resolved to close, then at a replacement wartime prison. Told that several dozen detainees could not be tried for any crime but would be particularly risky to release, and that a handful might be prosecutable only under the looser rules governing evidence in a military commission, Mr. Obama decided that the responsible policy was to keep both the tribunals and the indefinite detentions available. The president refused to use either power on newly captured terrorism suspects, instead prosecuting them in civilian court. But by leaving the options open, he helped normalize them and left them on a firmer legal basis . Mr. Obama followed a similar course with several national security practices that became controversial during his first term. After his use of drones to kill terrorism suspects away from war zones led to mounting concerns over civilian casualties and other matters, he issued a ※ presidential policy guidance § in May 2013 that set stricter limits. They included a requirement that the target pose a threat to Americans 〞 not just to American interests 〞 and that there would be near certainty of no bystander deaths. But the Obama administration also successfully fought in court to establish that judges would not review the legality of such killing operations, even if an American citizen was the target. Mr. Trump 〞 who has said he would ※bomb the hell out of ISIS,§ beyond what Mr. Obama is doing, and go after civilian relatives of terrorists, prevailing over any military commanders who balked 〞 could scrap the internal limits while invoking those precedents to shield his acts from judicial review. Similarly, after a surge of criminal prosecutions against people who leaked secret information to the news media and bipartisan outrage at aggressive investigative tactics targeting journalists, the Obama Justice Department issued new guidelines for leak investigations intended to make it harder for investigators to subpoena reporters' testimony or phone records. It also decided not to force a reporter for The New York Times to testify in a leak trial or face prison for contempt. But the Obama administration also successfully fought in court to establish that the First Amendment offers no protection to journalists whom the executive branch chooses to subpoena to testify against confidential sources. Mr. Trump, who has proposed changing libel laws to make it easier to sue news organizations, could abandon the Obama-era internal restraints and invoke the Obama-era court precedent to adopt more aggressive policies in leak investigations. Well done Obama.",

    "text": "US impunity erodes world justice ↙ Deficit hysteria invades the presidential campaign The smog of decades-old fiscal wars crept into the final debate〞and the folks who want to cut Social Security managed to sneak in. By Todd Gitlin Posted on October 27, 2016 by Todd Gitlin \nWhether you think Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton prevailed in last week's debate〞Clinton by sounding like an adult, Trump by clenching his jaw to keep from foaming at the mouth〞one undisputed winner was an entity called the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget . That awkward mouthful adorns a letterhead think tank that moderator Chris Wallace cited twice as an authority on the purportedly world-shattering dangers of government overspending. \nThe CRFB wears the bluest of ribbons at the forefront of the parade of worthies who have been shaking their fists at a falling fiscal sky for decades. Let's call them the Responsibles. They are a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bowles-Simpson-Peterson Establishment, which has long crusaded to cut Social Security benefits and otherwise put federal government spending in a chokehold. Erskine Bowles is the financier and onetime White House chief of staff for former President Bill Clinton, who has apparently never met a corporate board he didn't like to join. Alan Simpson is the former Republican senator from staunchly Republican Wyoming who once likened Peter G. Peterson is a billionaire who served as President Richard M. Nixon's Commerce secretary, a veteran of the Wall Street investment firms Lehman and Blackstone who has been beating the drums for public austerity since at least 1992. In 2010, Peterson joined Warren Buffett and Bill Gates in agreeing to give half their wealth to charity. On the receiving end of Peterson's largesse, reputed to add up to $458 million between 2007 and 2011, was the foundation that has sported his name \nIf Trump were a normal Republican candidate, we would have heard a great deal more about nightmarish debt and entitlement crises during this campaign. Even as Republican presidents from Reagan to George W. Bush ran up the deficit and Bill Clinton ran surpluses, Republicans and Blue-Dog Democrats have thundered consistently on〞deficit, deficit DEFICIT, brought on by tax-and-spend liberals . This was the theme song behind the so-called sequester deal of 2012 \nOfficially, these worthies can lay claim to the label because they do feature center-right Democrats (Leon Panetta is the best known) to lend a certain sheen. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker enjoys widespread esteem, so when he co-authors a New York Times op-ed with Peterson, and refuses to engage the progressive counterarguments , the conventional wisdom gets one more boost and the regressiveness of their argument is obscured. \nVolcker and Peterson allow that bending the medical cost curve would help Medicare in the long run, but fail to acknowledge that the long run has already arrived. Panicky Americans are left to quaver at the unwarranted expectation that Social Security will go bust before they get to collect. Volcker and Peterson ignore the promise of progressive taxation. A financial transaction (or Robin Hood ) tax does not interest them. Neither does cracking down on the corporate practice of tax evasion with shell games of offshoring profits . The appallingly regressive nature of the Social Security payroll tax does not catch their eyes. As the New America Foundation's Steven Hill wrote in July \nCalling proposals to balance the budget by further cutting the social safety net ※nonpartisan§ disguises the skewed nature of the center-right consensus that chokes off grown-up debate on the options. Americans are allergic to straightforward ideological disputation, so if we're not looking closely, we regard ※nonpartisanship§ as a surrogate for ※fairness and balance.§ There's not a progressive in the Responsible pack. But why should there be? However willing clear-headed progressives are to acknowledge that government spending is not a sure-fire solution to everything that ails the body politic〞not even close〞they think that a good deal of unnecessary suffering could be avoided with the judicious use of deficits. This prospect \nAmerican politics is deadlocked in no small part because of received opinion〞what Paul Krugman This post was first published on BillMoyers.com \nTodd Gitlin is a professor of journalism and sociology and chair of the Ph.D. program in communications at Columbia University.

    "title": "US-Korean Relations and the New US President | New Eastern Outlook",
    "text": "Region: Eastern Asia While observing the reaction of the Korean society to the victory of D. Trump in the Presidential elections, a great grief can be seen  the political circles of South Korea supported Clinton owing to Trump's desire to increase the charge for maintaining the American contingent in the Republic of Korea as the bare minimum. This contingent currently includes 28.5 thousand military personnel, F-16 destroyers, the Patriot anti-aircraft weapon system, and other types of offensive and defensive weapons. South Korea will need 16.3 billion dollars to replace them and given the economic crisis and political challenges, it will be difficult for Seoul to find that kind of money. As soon as the US elections result was announced, Park Geun-hye congratulated Trump on his victory and noted that the American nation had expressed confidence in his leadership skills and huge successful experience in various fields. The head of the Republic of Korea also highlighted that Seoul would maintain close cooperation with Washington aimed at global stability and prosperity. The very same day, on November 9, the Korean President's Administration conducted an emergency session of the National Security Council. Park Geun-hye ordered that emergency response measures regarding the economy and security be prepared amid the new environment. On November 10, the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Korea held a session to assess the results of the Presidential elections in the USA. As a result, the military officials confirmed their position regarding continued cooperation with the USA on the rotational deployment of the US strategic forces in the Republic of Korea, the THAAD ABM mobile system, and the transfer of operational control over its military forces to Seoul in time of war. In addition, it was decided to create a Working Group on Cooperation with the USA in defence policy aimed at maintaining the strong union between the Republic of Korea and the USA. The first result of this Group's work was a report delivered on November 14, which states that the US government may demand an increase in the expenses paid by South Korea for maintaining the American military contingent as well as improving the capabilities of its own army. The former policy of Barack Obama will be replaced with more active sanction pressure that allows dialogue, however. In this context, the American party should receive explanation of what measures are taken by the Republic of Korea to ensure the comfortable presence of the US contingent and it should be specified that the armed forces of the USA are contributing to peace and stability in the region. The expenses of the Republic of Korea for the maintenance of the US contingent in terms of GDP share are higher than that in Japan and Germany. A possible reconsideration of free trade conditions has also been noted. The Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Yoo Il-ho said that Donald Trump's victory in the elections could provide the South Korean economy with new opportunities. South Korean companies might participate in the development of infrastructure and industry in the USA. Thus, the Korean government has started preparing to work with the new American government by conducting a detailed monitoring of Trump's economic program. Commenting on the authorities' activities, the Korean media write that it is difficult to assess Donald Trump's policy regarding the North. One day he called Kim Jong-un a maniac, and the other day he didn't rule out possible dialogue with Pyongyang, regarding solution to the North Korean nuclear issue. As for the potential tense situations in relations between the Republic of Korea and the USA that require reconsideration, they concern more than Korea's share of the expenses for the maintenance of the American military contingent. Currently, South Korea covers half of them, but Trump has expressed the opinion that the Republic of Korea should take on 100% of the expenses and the funds spent by the USA on the security of its allies should be used for its own needs. In addition, he has also spoken about the possible nuclearization of the Republic of Korea and Japan. Despite the fact that the radical conservators of the Republic of Korea are already discussing such a variant, Seoul is against it, maintaining that it would deteriorate regional stability. In addition, Donald Trump believes that the conditions of the free trade agreement between the Republic of Korea and the USA are not equal and deprive Americans of jobs. He has announced the need to reconsider the corresponding agreements. All these facts could not help but raise concerns among traditional US allies. The lack of direct communication channels with Donald Trump's team is also generating fears. Hoping for Clinton's success, the South Korean politicians did not establish relations with her opponent. Thus, the necessity to make preliminary preparations for cooperation with the new US government is felt as never before. However, there have been no sharp changes in policy observed so far. On November 09, 2016, during the previous briefing, White House spokesperson Joshua Earnest noted that the Administration of Donald Trump would likely stick to the policy of maintaining strong relations between Washington and Seoul. Both the Democrats and the Republicans have been working to strengthen relations between the USA and the Republic of Korea. Moreover, any stand-out problems in relations between the two countries (for example, under Park Chung-hee and Carter) arose with greater frequency under the Democrats. The next day, on November 10, during a telephone conversation with the President of the Republic of Korea Park Geun-hye, Donald Trump confirmed Washington's commitment to the union with Seoul and provision of South Korea's security. According to the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, over the course of the ten minute talk, Donald Trump announced that Washington would certainly continue to cooperate with Seoul on security issues. Some American experts also believe that there will be no changes. For example, the former Chairman of the United States House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Pieter Hoekstra, believes that the new government headed by Donald Trump will maintain strong relations with the Republic of Korea. Hoekstra has highlighted that Seoul and Washington currently enjoy close economic and security cooperation, and South Korea believes that this statement is aimed at defusing concerns. Of course, according to KBS World Radio, Trump's forceful statements are a reflection of his attitude. Perhaps, it was only linked to his desire to gain the support of a large number of voters, however. South Korean experts hope that Trump's strong statements will not be implemented in the new government's actual policy and they will stick to more restrained and reasonable policy. The South Korean opposition is of the same opinion. The faction leader of the opposition Democratic Party Toburo Woo Sang-ho has announced that American lawmakers do not want changes in the relations between the Republic of Korea and the USA, thus, the Koreans should not worry about Donald Trump's victory in the presidential elections. The leader of the opposition People's Party Park Jie-won has also noted that Donald Trump will conduct policy from a practical point of view and the Republic of Korea may enjoy some benefits.

Google appoints Vice-President Google appoints Vice-President Tuesday, 1 November, 2016 - 09:30 \nIsrael Meir Brand has become a new Vice President of Google Corporation. Sundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Google Inc reported this information. Brand was the first Google Israel employee and was appointed CEO of Google Israel. \nAt the same time Meir Brand will continue to rule Israel, the Middle East, Africa, Russia, Turkey, and Greece. \nAgainst the background of the latest Wikileaks data about rigging custom queries of Google and Yahoo in favor of Clinton and other assistance provided by the corporation of the Democratic Party headquarters (also financing by Israeli billionaires), the appointment of Meir Brand means the strengthening Israel's role in the information space. \nDespite the fact that Google has apologized for the changes on their maps (Palestine, for example, has not been marked as autonomy one, there was no Serbian monastery of Visoki De?ani), Tel Aviv is known to use actively possibilities of censorship in Internet. The recent changes are likely aimed to an active information attack including at strategically important areas, with which Meir Brand is familiar (Russia, Turkey, Middle Eastern countries).

    "text": "41 Views November 02, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News \nWith the U.S. dollar, stocks and crude oil trading lower and the price of gold and silver surging, the Fear Index is spiking after a Fed President just confessed that the central banks' radical accommodative monetary policies have failed. ※Central bankers stationed in the world's leading economies have put into practice radical accommodative monetary policy, based on what appeared to be sound economic theory. But it has not worked in practice and policy makers are only now beginning to understand why.§ 〞 Dallas Fed President, Richard Fisher \n(King World News) Gerald Celente 〞 Between the stream of WikiLeaks' email dumps challenging the practices of Hillary Clinton's campaign and the ethics of the Clinton Foundation, plus the FBI's announcement to further investigate Clinton's emails from her private server when she was secretary of state, Wall Street's odds she would beat Donald Trump next Tuesday are no longer a sure bet. \nFear Index Spikes! Fearing a Trump victory, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiked more than 40 percent over the last six days. It was the first time the VIX rose for six straight days since the lead-up to the UK's Brexit vote. And prospects of a Trump presidency also pushed the dollar down and gold prices higher, since the word on The Street is that the odds of a Fed interest rate hike in December would diminish, the dollar would fall and gold would rally＃ IMPORTANT: To find out which high-grade silver mining company billionaire Eric Sprott just purchased a nearly 20% stake in and learn why he believes this is one of the most exciting silver stories in the world  CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored \nIt's the economy, stupid While aspects of current market volatility are attributed to who wins the US presidential election, we forecast a sustained ※fear index§ fueled by economic data, not poll results. \nIndeed, while US equity markets volatility spiked before and after the Brexit vote, the Dow proceeded to hit new highs in the months that followed. Thus, while volatility may subside following the election, trend lines for a deep market fall and sharp rise in gold prices are based not on a ※fear index§ of emotions of who wins the White House, but rather indisputable market fundamentals. \nFor example: Essentially blacked out of the mainstream news and barely making the business news is the latest report from the Netherlands showing global trade volume in 2016's first quarter was flat, while slumping 0.8 percent in the second quarter. In the United States, the world's largest economy, the value of imports and exports fell $200 billion last year, and for the first nine months of this year, trade plummeted an additional $470 billion. \nThus, while economic growth has slogged along at a tepid 2 percent since the Great Recession, it is the first time since World War II that trade has declined in the US while the economy has grown. \nTrend Forecast: Facts prove that ※free market§ trade, the primary engine of global growth for the past quarter century, is in decline. Moreover  from the $500-billion-plus record-breaking merger-and-acquisition activity in October, to corporate stock buy-backs, to growing concerns of multiple speculative bubbles bursting in China, etc.  it was, and is, central-bank cheap-money schemes, not increased consumption and investment that have artificially inflated real estate and equity markets. \nCurrently, there is a general consensus that record-low-interest-rate and massive central-bank quantitative-easing policies have failed to generate global growth, and their ability to impact future economic policy is doubtful. Thus, we forecast multiple ※fear actors§ rattling equity markets long after the US presidential elections. Therefore, we maintain our forecast that when gold prices stabilize above $1,400 per ounce, they will spike toward $2,000. \n  With Gold Hitting $1,300, Look At Who Is Bullish",

    "title": "Is President Trump Really Going To Revalue Gold To This Jaw-Dropping Price?",
    "text": "50 Views November 15, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News \nAfter the election chaos of last week, is President Trump really going to revalue gold to this jaw-dropping price? \nPart II of James Turk's KWN interview: ※When I say that the dollar is toast, Eric, I am of course referring to the Federal Reserve dollar (F$), which circulates as a money substitute in place of the Constitutional dollar (C$). The C$ is 11.369 grains of gold ($42.22 per ounce)＃ Sponsored \nPresident Nixon ※temporarily§  to use his word  suspended the conversion of F$s into C$s back in 1971. \nTrump's only option to end the clear divisions in the country is to increase prosperity with a level playing field for everyone. And the way to do that is to take away the advantages the 1%ers enjoy as a result of an unconstitutional monetary system. \nThe Need To Build A Sound Monetary System So President Trump has to build a sound monetary system. To do this he must end Nixon's temporary suspension of dollar redeemability into gold. Restoring a Constitutional dollar will provide a solid the foundation for building a new monetary system. The best way to do that is to follow the precepts of the Coinage Act of 1792, which is America's first and best time-tested law concerning money. \nBack in June, when asked about the gold standard Trump replied: ※Bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do, but boy, would it be wonderful.§ \nThe ※hard§ task he is of course referring to is making the gold standard credible after decades of monetary debasement. Rebuilding credibility will indeed be a difficult task, but can be accomplished over time. Initially all that is needed is to make sure that gold flows into the Treasury  and not out from it  when redemption of the dollar into gold is restored. \nWill Trump Revalue Gold To $10,000? To do that Trump will need to make the new monetary system credible by accounting for all the monetary debasement of the F$ since 1971. That means the Treasury will need to be ready to act as required under a gold standard to buy gold and redeem dollars for gold at a credible price, which I calculate to be $10,000 per ounce. \nSome may find $10,000 to be eye-watering, but this amount is based on historical experience. It would simply be repeating what happened in 1934. When President Roosevelt devalued the dollar by 41% from 23.222 grains of gold ($20.67) to 13.714 grains ($35), gold flowed into the Treasury in exchange for dollars. The resulting increase of sound money flowing into the economy enabled it to begin the process of recovering from the depths of the Great Depression. \nSo to make a new gold standard credible by getting gold to flow into the Treasury, we need to repeat what FDR did. It is easy to calculate. \nAfter the 1934 devaluation, the weight of gold in the Treasury was 15% of the total quantity of dollars in M3. Today M3 is $17.6 trillion, and supposedly there are 261.5 million ounces of gold in Treasury vaults. Which equates to $67,304 per ounce. So 15% of that is $10,095. For simplicity, let's round it to $10,000, meaning that one C$ would be defined as 0.048 of one grain of gold. At that $10,000 rate of exchange, gold will flow into the Treasury from the far reaches of the planet, benefitting global economies as well as the US economy. \nWe need to ask ourselves, won't this resulting increase in the money supply be inflationary? Answer: No more than it was during the Great Depression. In one year after FDR's devaluation, M3 increased by 10.2%, but there was little inflation. The bulk of the new money was not put into speculation, but rather, used in productive purposes that began rebuilding the US economy. \nWhat's more, commodities and other goods that were being hoarded as an alternative to bank deposits flowed into circulation, helping keep inflation under control. The same thing will happen today. But let's not forget, what happens to the federal government's debt mountain? I suspect some government promises will be broken  like changing Social Security to reduce payouts  to enable the debt to be brought back under control, which brings up one last point. \nA credible national currency and creditworthy government are different things. They do go hand-in-hand, but you need the former to achieve the latter. The reason of course is that governments cannot create gold out of thin air, like they do paper dollars. That is the wisdom the framers enshrined in the Constitution. Let's hope Mr Trump values their wisdom and re-establishes the monetary legacy they left for us. A sound dollar helped build a great country where everybody was given the opportunity for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. \nAs president with a Republican controlled Congress, Trump can change everything. America's best hope is he rescinds Nixon's ※temporary§ suspension of the dollar's redeemability into gold and puts the dollar back on a credible gold standard at $10,000 per ounce.§ For those who are interested in hearing more about the gold market and the Trump shocker, KWN has just released   gold,   more. and you can listen to this extraordinary interview   Legend Art Cashin On A Trump Presidency, The New World Order, Gold, Brexit, The Great Depression And Why We Will See Panic",

    "text": "Progressive Nomad: Bernie Sanders Pens CRUCIAL Letter To The President (IMAGES) By Stephanie Kuklish on October 29, 2016 Subscribe \nOn the heels of Thursday's brutal attack on Native Americans peacefully protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline by local and state police officers, Senator Bernie Sanders has written an open letter to President Obama asking for him to stand up against this atrocity. \nIn a message posted on Sander's official U.S. Senate website, he asked for President Obama to halt construction of the pipeline until cultural and environmental reviews were done by trusted sources. Sanders wrote : ※It is deeply distressing to me that the federal government is putting the profits of the oil industry ahead of the treaty and sovereign rights of Native American communities. Mr. President, you took a bold and principled stand against the Keystone pipeline  I ask you to take a similar stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline. To my mind, the [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers] should have never approved this project on an expedited process in the first place.§ \nSanders continued the letter by urging the President to send non-partial monitors to the camp in order to ensure that the water protector's civil rights were being protected. He then reminded President Obama just how dangerous this pipeline, and others like it, can be for the environment. Sanders stated : ※According to one report, burning the oil transported through the pipeline would produce carbon emissions equivalent to 21 million cars or 30 coal plants. If we have any hope of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change, we should not be building new oil pipelines that lock us into burning fossil fuels for generations to come.§ \nIt has been incredibly difficult to get media coverage on this event, and even when there is; everyone seems to turn a blind eye to what is going on in North Dakota. Police are once again lying about the protestors and taking very violent and forceful tactics against them, even though they are not armed and are showing little to no signs of violent actions. \nAt some point this has got to end and either the President can make a stand or he may be addressing the nation apologizing for wasteful human deaths at the hands of our own police force.",

    "text": "Subscribe \nDear GOP Presidential Candidate Donald Trump, \nI just watched a portion of your interview from Sunday night and I was appalled. You seriously need to be put over someone's knee. \nYou are running for the highest leadership position in this country and you are carrying on like a spoiled little toddler, stomping your feet and throwing temper tantrums and hollering all over social media. Hollering things like ※Stop calling me names!§※I hate you!§※You're being mean to me!§※I'm telling my mommy!§ are not things that an adult man does  those are things that a toddler does. \nHere is a prime example : ※In what is now a familiar pattern, Donald Trump took to Twitter following his interview in order to trash the interviewer and whine about how the questions were supposedly stacked against him.§ \nGuess what? Running this country is HARD. It isn't for whiners. Not once have I heard President Obama whine about you running him through the ringer about his birth certificate. Not once have I heard him whine when people in public office have disrespected him. Not once have I heard him whine when Congress has voted against his programs simply because he is a black man and they don't like him. Not once in almost seven years has that man whined that Fox News has said something bad about him. Not once. Let that sink in. \nI ain't your mommy, but I am a mom. Nothing more  Just A Mom. I have a normal kid. But for a few minutes here I'm going to pretend you're my son because you really seem to need a mom's advice. When my kid has a temper tantrum, she gets sent to her room. When she can talk calmly to adults, she is allowed to come out and we discuss what she did wrong. \nI'm thinking that maybe no one ever did that for you. No one ever said ※No§ to you. You never got a spanking, literally or figuratively. \nYou are acting like an insufferable ass. The United States is not a dictatorship. It is not a corporation that you can run into the ground and file bankruptcy on. It is a democratic government that is set up with three distinct branches of government. Those three branches of government are designed to act with a series of checks and balances to ensure that no one person has the authority or the ability to make horrid decisions, treat people in a sucky way, and waste our tax dollars on frivolities. \nHere is a link to a children's website , where they spell it out at a level that even you should be able to comprehend. \nBy saying ※ We'll see ※ every time the interviewer reminded you of this system of checks and balances you displayed your ignorance of how our government works. My 12-year-old knows more about government than you appear to. \nThis is not a media circus for you to use to continue pumping hot air into the atmosphere. Global climate change is already a problem and your constant bloviating is causing more detrimental effects than the farting cows. Stop treating this campaign like your very own little playground. It isn't. Our government is a democracy  that means that if hell freezes over and you do somehow manage to gain the presidency you work for us, the people of this country. \nHere's a thought  instead of building a wall that will cost billions, why don't you propose an amnesty program that could be enacted for a couple million? The sheer cost of deporting millions of people, only to turn around and let them back in ＆legally' is an astronomical burden to place on already over-burdened tax payers. It is also the DUMBEST idea I have ever heard. Does having all that money remove any shred of common sense? Do you possess any ability to think reasonably? \nYou would be amazed at how many cost-cutting things can be enacted if you think about them and come up with common sense solutions. The end goal is what you want to accomplish. \nSince your fellow Republicans are going to be the biggest stopping block on any type of an amnesty program  sell them on what they stand to GAIN from doing this as opposed to booting everyone out and building an asinine wall. \nYou can't just think about ※The Donald§ and how he feels about things. You have to consider each and every person in this country. You have to take our tax dollars and use them in the best way possible to make life better for us. This isn't all about you. You're just a potty-mouthed little boy that needs a bar of soap to wash your mouth out and a time-out to reflect on your actions lately. \nYou can't act like a spoiled little toddler if you expect to be taken seriously as a GOP presidential candidate. You need to stop that silliness right now. Get your head out of your ass and look around. You have no clue how to run a government. If you want to continue acting like a toddler, no one will ever take you seriously. The voters in this country will not subject themselves to being ruled by a spoiled brat. \nGrow up, Donald.",

    "text": "10 Strange Facts About Our Presidents   July 25, 2015 Subscribe \nThey may well be some of the most recognizable men on the face of the Earth: Our Presidents. Think you know all there is to know from history about these men? Think again and take a look at these strange facts: Presidential Alligators \n\nTwo different Presidents had pet alligators: John Quincy Adams and Herbert Hoover. \nAdams received his pet alligator as a gift from a French general, and it lived in an unfinished bathroom of the White House. Hoover's son had two alligators that frequently roamed the White House grounds. Bet that kept the Secret Service on their toes. Greek and Latin \n\nJames Garfield, our 20th President, could write well with each hand, but he also could write Greek with one hand and Latin with the other at the same time! Try that sometime! Cool Coolidge \nCalvin Coolidge was fond of pranking the White House staff by pressing all the buttons in the Oval Office just to watch everyone run in frantically, unsure of what was wrong. The Rough Rider Roosevelt \nDuring a speech in Milwaukee, a failed assassin shot Teddy Roosevelt in the chest. His next words were, ※I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot.§ When everyone attempted to take him to the hospital, he waved them off and finished his 90 minute speech with the bullet still lodged in his chest! Now that's toughness! Dueling Jackson \nPresident Andrew Jackson was involved in over 100 duels, most to protect the reputation of his wife. In one, Jackson offered his opponent the first shot. The man shot Jackson, but Jackson merely shook it off, like it was a bee sting, then shot and killed the unlucky opponent. Fashion Model Before Gerald Ford was President, he worked as a fashion model in New York City. He even made it to the cover of Cosmopolitan with Phyllis Brown in 1942. Out-Of-This-World Carter \nBefore he became President, Jimmy Carter was making a speech in Georgia when he saw a UFO. He filed a report of the incident with the International UFO Bureau stating that it was a self-illuminating, bright white object hovering in the sky. Bartender-In-Chief \nBefore Abraham Lincoln was the President, he was a lawyer. But before that he was he was a bartender. He owned a saloon, Berry and Lincoln, with his friend William Berry. Bushusuru \nPoppy Bush was in Asia for a trade conference. At a state event held by the Japanese Prime Minister, Bush fainted after vomiting all over the banquet host. The Japanese later coined the term ※Bushusuru§ meaning ※to do the Bush thing§ or ※to vomit.§ Gambling Harding \nWarren Harding loved to play poker, and during one game he bet a set of priceless White House china, which he promptly lost. \nh/t and All Images: BrainJet",

    "text": "at 1:43 pm 3 Comments \nBy now, everyone on planet earth has heard about the bombshell news just announced by the FBI that it was re-opening its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. Here's the text of FBI head James Comey's letter to Congressional leaders. \nObviously, lots of people are out there pontificating on what, if anything, this means. As such, I'm going to add my two cents to the conversation. \nI've prided myself on unemotionally calling this election how I see it the whole time, because I'm neither a Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump supporter. Being free of the tremendous baggage that comes with cheerleading a particular candidate in this contentious election, I had consistently predicted a Trump victory until the Access Hollywood tape emerged. At that point I penned a thought-piece titled, Donald Trump is in Trouble  Part 2 , in which I changed my forecast to a Hillary Clinton victory. \nHere's some of what I wrote: \nAfter watching yesterday's audio and reading through the Wikileaks revelations, my prediction has changed for the first time this election. All things equal from here on out (meaning no additional huge revelations against Hillary), I think Hillary Clinton will defeat Donald Trump. I don't think it's going to be a landslide, but I think she's probably going to win. The audio was very harmful for Donald Trump, and now I'm going to explain why. \nFirst of all, if you want to accurately forecast the outcome of this election you need to get into the minds of the masses. Just like trading financial markets, what you think is right doesn't matter. What matters is what everyone else collectively thinks, and whether or not they're going to get off their asses and vote. A big part of why I thought Trump would win related to the fact that I believe many people were simply looking for an excuse to vote for him. Justified disgust with the status quo in general, and Hillary Clinton in particular, pushed millions of Americans into the camp of being willing to take a gamble on Trump despite disliking him personally and disagreeing with him on many issues. I felt strongly that there were millions upon millions of Americans you could place into this category 〞 people who were ※flirting with the idea of voting Trump.§ I believe a significant amount of these people will not vote for him as a result of the audio. Will it be the majority of them? Probably not, but it will be a material number and arguably enough to swing the election. No, I don't think these voters will shift to Hillary, and no, I don't think committed Trump voters will change their minds. However, I do think enough of these willing to be convinced, leaning-Trump types will now stay home or vote third party. It's these voters who I expected to swing the election in Trump's favor, and they are now unreliable. \nDoes Trump's vulgarity excuse the incalculable crimes of Hillary Clinton and her husband, making them preferable in this election? No it doesn't, but that's not the point of this article. Most voters are too superficial, too busy trying to survive and too uninformed to weigh all the very important issues rationally. As an example, think about how most conversations are going to go down this weekend. Let's say you're out with a bunch of friends for drinks tonight. Someone says, ※so have you seen the Trump audio?§ If someone in the group hasn't, someone will pull out their phone and it'll be watched in 3 minutes. What if someone then says, ※yeah, but have you seen the leaked Hillary emails?§ What will your response be? You can't adequately explain the importance of that to your friends in 3 minutes. Instead, you'll have to send them a lengthy article that they'll never read. So by the end of this weekend, pretty much everyone in America will have heard the Trump audio, while maybe 10% will take the time to analyze what came out of Wikileaks. There goes your election. \nUnderstanding the craziness of the election, I finished the piece with the following. \nDespite all of that, I still can't say with certainty that Hillary will win. However, I do think the landscape has changed enough, that for the first time this entire election season, I am no longer confident of a Trump victory. Then again, I was absolutely convinced that Hillary was unelectable after she collapsed on 9/11 and mislead everyone about her health, and I was wrong about that. That's how completely crazy this election is, and there's still a month to go. Anything can happen, particularly with the debate coming up this Sunday. So while it's certainly not out of the question, there will have to be some very material events over the next month to put Trump back in the driver's seat. \nWhile the Wikileaks emails have been an important factor in keeping this race close, I didn't think they were sufficient to alter my forecast of a Clinton victory. I think the reopening of the FBI investigation is enough of a black swan to materially change the course of this race. \nClinton supporters will read this and think I'm insane. They will think this because they are anticipating a landslide victory for Hillary. I never expected a landslide, so I think this news tips the election into a total tossup situation. My reasoning for the change is the same that led me to switch my forecast to Hillary after the Access Hollywood video was released. The primary reason I initially thought Trump would win related to the fact I believed enough people would be willing to vote for a person they don't really like in order to blow up the status quo. I felt that the video recording of Trump's vulgar commentary was enough to put those people into the absentee or third party column, despite millions of Americans looking for an excuse to vote for Trump due to the well understood awfulness of Hillary. This has changed, and voters now have the excuse they needed to vote Trump. \nThat reason is simple. The problems with Hillary Clinton will never go away. They will always resurface or new problems will emerge, and it has nothing to do with a ※vast rightwing conspiracy§ (or Putin). It has to do with her. It has to do with the fact that her and her husband are career crooks, warmongers, and shameless looters of the American public. This re-opening of the FBI investigation just hammers all of that home for everyone. We know what 4 years of Hillary will look like. It'll be Obama cronyism on steroids, plus endless investigations with a side of World War 3. I don't think people want that, and so more Americans than the pundits realize will take a gamble on Trump. \nAs a caveat, the above forecast assumes this new FBI investigation is not closed before November 8th. If it is, I think she'll win. If not, I think Trump has even odds to win, if not better. \nOf course, with 11 days left in this crazy election, many more black swans could emerge. Stay tuned. \nIn Liberty,",

    "text": "at 4:08 pm 1 Comment \nWith the neither the racist nor the Putin-puppet label sticking to Trump, team Clinton and its lobotomized surrogates have regressed back to square one: playing the woman card . \nAs I noted in a post earlier this week, a professor of linguistics at Berkeley just published an article at Time claiming (with zero evidence of course), that the Hillary Clinton email server scandal only exists because she is a woman. Here's a brief snippet of what she said: \n＆It's not about emails; it's about public communication by a woman' \nI am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It's us. \nThe only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she's doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. \nIt's not about emails; it's about public communication by a woman in general. Of course, in the year 2016, no one (probably not even The Donald) could make this argument explicitly. After all, he and his fellow Republicans are not waging a war on women. How do we know that? They have said so. And they're men, so they must be telling the truth. \nI know. It's really hard to believe the above is real, but it is. \nMoving along, President Obama himself is now getting in the mud. \nHere's what he had to say today in Ohio, according to NBC : \nCOLUMBUS, Ohio 〞 President Barack Obama said Tuesday that sexism is to blame for the tight race for the White House, telling an Ohio crowd that ※Hillary Clinton is consistently treated differently than just about any other candidate I see out there.§ \nObama went on: ※There's a reason we haven't had a woman president.§ \nSpeaking specifically to ※the guys out there,§ Obama told them to ※look inside yourself and ask yourself, if you're having problems with this stuff how much of it is that we're just not used to it?§ \nYep, because the American public handily elected a black man twice, but somehow we all draw the line at a woman. Perhaps, just perhaps, the problem is with Hillary. \nMoving along, all this reminded me of a very prescient comment made by Glenn Greenwald a couple of years ago, which I highlighted in the post, Glenn Greenwald on the 2016 Elections  ※They'll Probably Have a Gay Person After Hillary§ : \nHillary is banal, corrupted, drained of vibrancy and passion. I mean, she's been around forever, the Clinton circle. She's a fucking hawk and like a neocon, practically. She's surrounded by all these sleazy money types who are just corrupting everything everywhere. But she's going to be the first female president, and women in America are going to be completely invested in her candidacy. Opposition to her is going to be depicted as misogynistic, like opposition to Obama has been depicted as racist. It's going to be this completely symbolic messaging that's going to overshadow the fact that she'll do nothing but continue everything in pursuit of her own power. They'll probably have a gay person after Hillary who's just going to do the same thing. \nObama could've gone out on a high note, but he decided to go low. \nSad!",

    "title": "Final Thoughts on the U.S. Presidential Election",
    "text": "at 11:29 am 2 Comments \nElection 2016 has been extremely bittersweet for me. On the positive side, through both the Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump grassroots movements, we have seen clear proof that a huge number of Americans accurately understand that the current system is totally rigged and simply not working for them. These people didn't migrate toward these two candidates for some tweaks to the system here and there, their supporters want full scale paradigm level change. \nAs such, rather than dwelling on the differences between these two populist movements, let's consider some of the areas where they overlap. \n1. Trade 〞 Opposition to NAFTA and current ※trade§ deals such as TPP, TTIP, and TISA have been central to both the Sanders and Trump campaigns. \n2. War and militarism 〞 Whether you believe Trump is sincere or not, opposition to Obama/Clinton interventionist overseas wars were key talking points for both Trump and Sanders. \n3. The system is rigged 〞 The painful acknowledgment that the U.S. economic system is a rigged scam that fails to reward hard work, and is more akin to a parasitic, predatory oligarchy with very limited social mobility, has been a key campaign theme for both Trump and Sanders. The economy is increasingly dominated by near-monoploy giants who relentlessly push for more power and more profits irrespective of the cost to society, whether that cost be war, poverty or social unrest. \n4. Money in politics 〞 The rigged economic system described above aggregates wealth into an increasingly small number of hands. Those hands then buy off politicians and rig the political process. A rigged economy and rigged political system perpetually feeds itself and endlessly grows at the expense of the public like a terminal cancer. Both Trump and Sanders emphasized this problem. \n5. Rule of law is dead 〞 Sanders focused on Wall Street bankers, while Trump focused on Hillary and her inner circle of cronies, but the overall point is the same. Rich and powerful oligarchs are above the law. We all know this, but Washington D.C. refuses to do anything about. \nDespite all of the above, the ultimate status quo candidate, Hillary Clinton, has a very good chance of winning tomorrow's election. Why? Primarily because Donald Trump is a very divisive figure who focused too much on polarizing issues such as building a wall, stop-and-frisk, supporting torture, advocating for internet censorship and libel laws, etc. While he got his act together toward the end of the campaign, he spent far too much of it marginalizing people like me who desperately want to vanquish the status quo, but couldn't get comfortable with Trump. \nThis is where the election took on a decidedly negative tone for me on a personal basis. I've dedicated the last six years of my life to fully exposing and combating status quo corruption, but when the populist revolt finally arrived, the only choice I was given for change was one I couldn't embrace. For someone so passionately yearning for positive, paradigm-level change, that's been a crushing letdown. Personally, I've passed the point where I'm willing to vote for someone I don't believe in or trust. As such, I won't be voting for either one. That said, my individual vote is irrelevant, and I don't want to focus on that. The bigger question is, who do I think will win? \nOn that question, I don't have a strong opinion at the moment. Ultimately, it depends on whether Americans go into the voting booth and see status quo vs. blowing up the status quo, or if they see Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton. If they see the former, odds are in Trump's favor. If they see the latter, it's a matter of which personality Americans find least repulsive. \nSo here we stand. Despite the fact that a huge percentage of Americans deem both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to be ※unelectable,§ one of them is about to be elected. As such, we really need to start thinking and strategizing about the future. In that regard, I propose we look at the five points of Sanders/Trump overlap I highlighted earlier. If we can stay focused on those existential issues after the election irrespective of who wins, ※we the people§ have a good chance of uniting a clear majority of the population and ultimately turning this national disaster around. \nOr we can allow ourselves to be divided and conquered into oblivion. The choice is ours. \nIn Liberty,",

    "text": "Goldman Sachs Endorses Hillary Clinton For President For Goldman Sachs, was there really any other choice this cycle? | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, is greeted by Hillary Clinton at a panel discussion at the Clinton Global Initiative, Sept. 24, 2014 in New York. \nPublished in partnership with Shadowproof . \nHe's with her. On Sunday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein 〞an endorsement she had been working toward for years. \nAs was revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation. \nOn October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for ※political reasons§ because Congress needed to look like it was doing something about the crisis. She said, ※There's nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.§ \nYes, she essentially endorsed Wall Street writing the rules because Wall Street knows its business best and complained to Goldman Sachs that regulations had frightened bankers. \n※I mean, right now, there are so many places in our country where the banks are not doing what they need to do because they're scared of regulations, they're scared of the other shoe dropping, they're just plain scared, so credit is not flowing the way it needs to to restart economic growth,§ Clinton said. ※So people are, you know, a little 〞 they're still uncertain, and they're uncertain both because they don't know what might come next in terms of regulations, but they're also uncertain because of changes in a global economy that we're only beginning to take hold of.§ \nMusic to Wall Street's ears. For Goldman Sachs, was there really any other choice this cycle? After all, they did pay Hillary Clinton $675,000 for those three speeches, and have generously supported her political career. \nDespite her private comments to Goldman Sachs, Hillary Clinton has taken a tough public position on Wall Street during the campaign, likely due to Senator Bernie Sanders' success in the primaries. Of course, Wikileaks also revealed that Clinton told the National Multi-housing Council in a private speech that ※you need both a public and a private position.§ \nSo the real question is, what do Blankfein and Goldman want in return and what is Clinton's private position on giving it to them?

    "title": "Whether Clinton or Trump, Tensions Will Escalate with China and Russia Under Next U.S. President",
    "text": "by Jerri-Lynn Scofield \nJerri-Lynn here: There are many reasons to despair at the choice US voters face in tomorrow's election. The danger that either candidate will goad Russia or China, without respect to consequences, is perhaps the most immediate and frightening. While many media hounds chase the false scent of alleged Russian manipulation of Trump, the election, and Wikileaks, to name just a few of the crazy allegations being discussed, this more serious threat has not been pursued nearly as vigorously. \nIn this Real News Network interview , journalist John Pilger and TRNN's Paul Jay discuss why the very real prospect of another World War is not taken seriously by the US media. Pilger argues that whoever is elected, tensions with China and Russia will escalate. I tidied up the rush transcript as best I could. Please excuse any remaining errors. \nPAUL JAY, TRNN: Welcome to the Real News Network. I?'m Paul Jay. \nIn a few days, Americans are going to decide who the next President of the United States is going to be. Of course, this is an issue of global concern, given that the United States considers itself hegemon of the world and acts that way. What will be the difference perhaps is the foreign policy of the next President, whatever it is, Clinton or Trump. Based on what we?'ve seen the last few years and how does one assess all of this? I think we?'re assessing the degree of danger to the world. There doesn'?t seem to be any other measurement here. \nNow joining us to discuss all of this is John Pilger. John joins us from London. John is an award- winning very celebrated filmmaker and journalist. His films have been broadcast on major broadcast platforms and channels around the world. His latest film is The Coming War on China , which will be released in December. Thanks very much for joining us John. \nJOHN PILGER: You?'re welcome. \nJAY: So as I said in the opening, it?'s a kind of a question of who is more dangerous. There does?n't seem to be any question. I think in most thinking people?s minds that one way or the other, US foreign policy is going to be dangerous for people of the world, particularly in the Middle East but not only. What is your assessment in this moment? \nPILGER: Well it?'s always dangerous. I sometimes think that it?'s extraordinary I?'ve gotten to this stage in life and I haven'?t been blown up by US foreign policy. But so we all of us outside the US quake before a US election. That said, the US isn?'t run by presidents, it?'s run by a vast national security machine and that hasn'?t changed in the last 15 years or so. I think the other 2 candidates. One is clearly a rogue candidate and that?'s Donald Trump and the other, Hillary Clinton, is the candidate of this vast national security machine. \nI think what?'s been a pity for all of us outside the United States and indeed for all Americans, is that the hysteria over Donald Trump has obscured the fact that Hillary Clinton may well turn out to be one of the more dangerous presidents, assuming she does win as the polls suggest, though she may not of course. Because she is the president. She is almost the embodiment of a status quo that since 9/11 has left us all in a very precarious state. It?'s left the Middle East in a precarious state. But above all, it?'s brought us to the brink of some kind of very serious confrontation with Russia and the taunting of Russia, the intimidation of Russia is now unabated and just over the horizon there is a similar baiting of the other great nuclear power, China. \nNow this issue which of course amounts to the prospect of another world war, even another nuclear war, have not been touched on. \nWell they have been touched on. Ironically in the first debate, Donald Trump was asked about this and he said words to the effect, words that I would not go nuclear. I would not do a first strike. This was?n't used. It was?n't published. Now I would?'ve thought for whatever it'?s worth, he might not have meant it. Trump says a lot of things he does?n't mean. Contradicts himself. But I would?'ve thought that difference between Trump and Clinton on the issue of nuclear war, of war and peace was pretty critical. At least an issue to be debated. But it wasn?'t. \nJAY: Yeah, the American media is totally involved in this salacious part of Trump?'s history and as usual, not very interested in any issues of polices of substance. You can find things on both of these candidates that would give one the chills. Starting with Trump, the great danger of Trump is that it won?'t be President Trump, it will be President Pence. Pence has been asked who he?'s going to model his Vice Presidency after and he says Cheney and in terms of foreign policy outlook, there seems to be no difference between him and Cheney. \nPILGER: Well, what?'s the difference between any of them frankly? I mean neocon is a terrible word but it describes them all. Trump is perhaps more interesting because he seems to have upset all the establishment. The CIA wants him beaten, the Pentagon wants him beaten, the State Department wants him beaten, even his own party wants him beaten. I mean something recommends him and just his enemies do. So, whether there is a difference I think there?'s a difference of that much. I do emphasize this, that as you mentioned all these salacious stories about Trump but you know what do people want? Do they want to hear salacious stories or do they want to hear about the prospects of war and peace? Do they want to hear about whether we?'re entering an extremely dangerous period in relation to Russia or not? \nThese issues have not been addressed and I don?'t think there?s any doubt that Clinton who has very unusually named a cabinet already in a sense and a very good article by one of the independent journalists in Washington, Gareth Porter, listed these people and they?'re all war hawks. And she said it in the last debate. I?m going to have a no-fly zone in Syria. That means attacking Russian planes. \nJAY: I think there?'s no doubt whichever of these people get elected president, in spite of Trump?'s rhetoric and if you look at what Pence says, I think both Clinton and I will say a Pence Trump, and I put Pence first because I think that's the more likely scenario, are going to be looking for provocations with Russia. Both Clinton and Pence are using Russian rhetoric to try and engage but using more than rhetoric. There?'s this very interesting WikiLeaks that I don?'t think has received nearly enough attention which shows something about the State Department under Clinton?'s mentality. \nIt said in the WikiLeaks that it?'s not said who it?'s to or from but when I asked some of the people we know who have some expertise in this, they say it sounds like a State Department briefing. It says to get the Israelis in support or not in active opposition to the Iran deal we need to get rid of Assad. And essentially and one assumes the reason for getting that will please Israel is to undermine Hezbollah but it kind of shows what drives a lot of State Department thinking and I don'?t think it?'s a big stretch to think it drives Clinton thinking. \nPILGER: Yeah, well, she hasn'?t hidden it. She?'s had an obsequious relationship with Israel it's well known. Her tough talking, her militarist talking, is all out there in the open. She?'s made it clear that she?'s going to face off Vladimir Putin. She?'s going to talk tough to the Chinese. As a kind of insanity about all this. I mean US foreign policy is actually run in a straight line since 1945. But it's become more extreme in the last 10-15 years. That?'s what worries most of us outside the United States and ought to worry those of you in the United States that it?'s become so extreme now. So extreme that the prospect of an accidental war at the very least. Here we are at centenaries of the first world war where all the lessons of there are glaring out at us of not quite accidental war. Intended war that lit up and became a slaughter partly by accident. I don?'t for a moment think that this verbose provocateur who is currently the Defense Secretary, Mr. Carter, who is forever shouting his militarist slogans around the world. I don?'t for a moment think that he actually wants nuclear war. But he sure is trying to bring it on. I?'ve never known anything quite like his constant aggression. And this campaign of sending out these admirals and generals. Like Admiral Harry Harris in the Pacific speaking like Lord Palmerston in the 19th century. You know how much he runs from the world. You know what you say from Bollywood to Hollywood. You know these rather absurd people but with very great power. \nJAY: The overall agenda of American dominance I don?'t think changes much between the various administrations or parties. But do you not think sometimes individual and specific agendas within the complexity of the America elites plays a role? I?'ll give you a couple examples. First of all, Cheney clearly drove the Iraq war. John Kiriakou, the former CIA agent said there was a morning meeting with the heads of all the major agencies and top Pentagon officials in the year leading up to the Iraq War and that that completely quite out of the ordinary, that morning phone call was chaired by Dick Cheney. And that in that phone call, and Kiriakou was apparently on it sometimes with some of the CIA people, most of the heads of agencies, most of the officialdom of the military complex were against invading Iraq. Cheney actually threatened these people saying resign or do what you?'re ordered to. \nThere are times when specific agendas can take hold. Like for example the people I guess that what the Real News, they heard us talk about Project for New American Century often enough. The very far right type of agenda. The other one where I think it did make a difference is if you look at the Obama-McCain election. This is not to say Obama has not been aggressive and has not committed war crimes because he has. On the other hand, this is John ?Bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran? McCain and Obama does make a deal with Iran. I mean there are differences within these corridors of power which are sometimes important are there not? \nPILGER: Obama decided not to attack Iran. I don?'t know about making a deal with Iran. They decided not to attack Iran. Attacking Iran would?'ve been a disaster of course for the people of Iran and in the Middle East. But it would?'ve also been a disaster for the United States. \nJAY: As the Iraq War was. \nPILGER: He decided not to attack them. So yes, but Obama has run probably more wars simultaneously than any other president. He?'s run probably the most comprehensive terror campaign in his drone warfare of assassination. You know we can sit here and say that one is slightly better. \nJAY: I would?n't even use the word better. I would say in specific circumstances. \nPILGER: I was searching. I was going to say less insane than the other. Sure. But in the end, here we are in 2016 in a presidential campaign and I've covered 4 US presidential campaigns and I thought no you could?n't have Nixon as president. Well looking back on Nixon compared with some of the others who have come since, maybe a little less insane there. I don?'t know. But here we are in 2016 with this political freak show in the United States that spells great danger for all of us. \nJAY: John talk a little bit about the film you're working on and why you think there's such a looming confrontation with China, what?'s driving it? \nPILGER: Well it?'s not what I think. The evidence is very clear. I mean Obama, the one who?'s done the deals, he?s announced that he went to Australia in 2011 and announced what was known as the pivot to Asia and that was the deployment, the transfer of almost two-thirds of US naval forces into the Asia Pacific region by the year 2020. And at the moment there are 400 US bases ringing China. They start in Australia and they go all the way through Asia, up through the Pacific, Korea, Japan, across Eurasia, Afghanistan, India. If you look at them on a map, you can understand why the Chinese have apparently changed their nuclear policy to a first strike policy. They never had that. They used to keep the missiles and warheads separate. They don?'t anymore. \nIn the informed literature, the Journal of Concerned Scientists and there have been a number of articles that have described in some detail how the Chinese have changed their nuclear profile. They're worried. I was there not long ago and I spoke to a number of strategists and people are worried rather confused actually but worried and some of them are quite angry. The whole building of air strips on the Spratly and Paracel Islands in the South China Sea was a defensive move. Last year the United States conducted possibly the biggest naval exercise in history. Talisman Saber in which it rehearsed a blockade across the Malacca Straits through which comes 80% of China?'s oil and its raw materials. \nThe Chinese understand all of this. They know all of this. If it?'s not explained to us through our media, they certainly know about it. This kind of provocation against China has been almost, I would?n't say a sideshow but it?'s another chapter. The first chapter of course is the provocation of Russia. And that is probably the most dangerous. Does anyone in the United States know what the Russians are thinking? What people in Russia are thinking? That they?'re having civil drill exercises. What the Russian press is saying? What people think about this? \nThere is a sense in much of Russia that the United States is about to attack them. This is very, very dangerous because it puts a country in a defensive position, and that?'s when accidents can happen. There is no debate about this in what is it? Constitutionally the free-est place in the world, in the United States? Nothing. Read the New York Times for the last couple of days. It?'s become a sort of Cold War propaganda sheet. Stories that are clearly nonsense. \nJAY: The objective seems to be one would think to weaken Putin but if anything?'s going to strengthen Putin it?'s this kind of threat that creates an increased amount of nationalism and such. \nPILGER: Well I don?'t know if it will strengthen Putin at all. I don?'t know enough about Russia. But the little I do know suggests that Putin is one of those who is always talking about being a partner of the United States. He does want to be a partner. He sees Russia?'s future in Europe. There are others in Russia who have had enough of the talk of partnership and who drink in a deep well of Russian nationalism and Russian memory of all their great invasions of their country. So, I don?'t know whether it strengthens Putin or not. Perhaps it does?n't. Whatever it is, it?'s dangerous. \nJAY: You mean in other ways it could be strengthening far more nationalists and fascistic forces that could actually- \nPILGER: Well not fascistic. In fact, there are plenty of fascists in Ukraine. You would?n't know that reading the US press. There was a coup in 2014. Fascist led. Paid for by the United States. The truth of that is inverted and it has Russia invading Ukraine. I mean couldn'?t make it up but that?'s the received wisdom. Now I'?m not sure about the fascistic elements in Russia but there could be militarist elements and there could be those in the very powerful national security sector in Russia that say we have to prepare and they are preparing of course. Their weapons industry has been developing in a very sophisticated way in the last few years. Their air defenses and so on. But this is all war preparation. You know whether it?'s Clinton or Trump it?'s deeply worrying and deeply disturbing when reckless politicians like Hillary Clinton can stand up and beat every war drum that is put in front of them. That'?s reckless. \nJAY: Alright thanks very much for joining us, John. \nPILGER: You?'re welcome. \nJAY: And thank you for joining us on the Real News Network. 0 0 0 0 0 0",

    "text": "Wednesday 9 November 2016 Man whose job it was to rig US Presidential election fired \nThe man whose job it was to rig the election for Hillary Clinton has been fired without a reference this morning. \n53-year-old NWO black ops operative Simon Williams spent the last six months programming voting machines to flip votes, and mailing bundles of blank voting forms to registered Democrats. \nHowever, his failure to swing the result means he is unlikely to get the fat payoff and pension contributions he had been counting on. \nWilliams is also concerned that his lack of a reference to explain how he's spent the last few years of his life might count against him in the job market, with employers as far afield as Russia, Zimbabwe and Venezuela refusing to accept his word as an expert that he's good at controlling electoral outcomes. \nSources inside the Democrat party have highlighted this as just the first American job lost by Trump and warned there could be many more, specifically in the polling and political punditry industries. \n※It's outrageous,§ Simon told us. \n※I heard there was a great role coming up as stage manager for the CIA, but they won't even talk to me unless my resume contains what I've been doing for the last few years. \n※Which is a bit rich coming from them, if I may make so bold.

    "text": "The Top 5 Conspiracy Theories That Were Proven To Be True Because Donald Trump Ran For President Every election year, charges of favoritism in the media fly back and forth, this is as old as the Republic itself. But this year, conspiracy theorists have claimed that the MSM was not only in the bag for Crooked Hillary, but actively working to secure her election with false polls, false stories and rampant and illegal collusion with the candidate.   Thank you, WikiLeaks , for making this a memorable year for discovering the truth behind the power that controls our system. \nHistorians will look back on the Presidential Election of 2016 as the, not ※a§, but the turning point in American history for a variety of reasons. Not the least of which will be that, because Donald Trump ran and was attacked by such an army of haters, that the truth about so many things previously kept hidden was brought out into the open. So today we are happy to bring you: The Top 5 Conspiracy Theories Proven To Be True In 2016 THE BUSH FAMILY ARE PART OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER: Every since George H.W. Bush uttered his ※ we will bring in a New World Order § speech in 1991, conspiracy theorists has speculated that the Bush Crime Family were not really Republicans or even Conservatives, but globalists with a secret agenda. It took the nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican candidate for president to bring these worms out from under their rock. Not only have they opposed Trump, and refused to support the nominee of the party they claim to belong to, they are actively working to try and elect Crooked Hillary , globalist candidate for president. PROVEN TRUE. THE LIBERAL MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS CORRUPT: Every election year, charges of favoritism in the media fly back and forth, this is as old as the Republic itself. But this year, conspiracy theorists have claimed that the MSM was not only in the bag for Crooked Hillary , but actively working to secure her election with false polls , false stories and rampant and illegal collusion with the candidate . WikiLeaks, one of the best friends the truth has in America, exposed all that and more this election 2016. It showed that not only were the conspiracy theorists right, they didn't go far enough in their speculations. PROVEN TRUE. THE DNC RIGGED THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION PROCESS: After candidate Bernie Sanders exhibited Trump-sized crowds everywhere he went, people were shocked when he was so easily beaten by Crooked Hillary who struggles to draw people to her rallies. As it turned out, the DNC was not only actively working to nominate Hillary , they were also actively working to suppress the momentum of Bernie Sanders. PROVEN TRUE. THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SOLD ACCESS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT: For years now, conspiracy buffs have made the claim that the Clinton Crime Family, and Crooked Hillary sold access to the State Department for cash and favors. A book called Clinton Cash was even published documenting all this. But when WikiLeaks released emails proving this to be true and exposing the connections, it ceased to be a theory albeit remaining a conspiracy. PROVEN TRUE. GEORGE SOROS IS THE POWER BEHIND NEARLY ALL OF IT: George Soros real life history reads like a sordid crime novel. Born Jewish, he switched teams as a teenager in WWII and sided with the Nazis . This began a life of crime and intrigue that helped him amass an enormous fortune. Revelations in 2016 have showed Soros to be one of Hillary Clinton's largest single donors , his orders were carried out by Crooked Hillary's State Department, he funded the race riots which started in 2015, and he is behind massive voter fraud both here and around the world. If you go to vote and see a SmartMatic voting machine , immediately demand a paper ballot if you want your vote to be accurately recorded. George Soros is even the financial power behind the massive wave of Muslim migration in Europe. And the money behind Black Lives Matters as well. PROVEN TRUE. \nSo thank you, WikiLeaks , for making this a memorable year for discovering the truth behind the power that controls our system. And thank you, Donald J. Trump, for having the courage to run this campaign, spending $100 million of your own money, and calling us to make America great, again. CNN Caught Covering Up Hillary Cheating at Debates: Gen.

    "text": "NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Donald Trump Will Be 70 Years, 7 Months And 7 Days Old On First Full Day In Office As President On May 14, 2018, Israel will have been officially regathered, in fulfillment of Bible prophecy, for exactly 70 years. In 70 AD, Israel was destroyed by the Romans and the Temple stones toppled to the ground exactly as Jesus said it would happen. When you subtract 70 AD from 2018 AD, where does that leave you? It leaves you square in 1948 AD. Please pause here and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. by Geoffrey Grider November 3, 2016 God likes to orchestrate events relating to Israel around the number 70 \n※In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years , whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.§ Daniel 9:2 (KJV) \nPeople, you better buckle up because things are about to become unglued. For well over a year now, we here at NTEB have been telling you that Donald Trump is God's man for the White House, and that Bible prophecy would be fulfilled in the process. Two very eye-opening articles you need to read are The Real Reason Why Donald Trump Was Chosen To Be The Republican Candidate For President and Why A Bible Believer Is Supporting Donald Trump For President Of The United States . I wrote those articles on May 4 and February 13, respectively. Israel in general and Jerusalem in particular are God's time clock for the fulfillment of Bible prophecy \nOn our Sunday night radio show , which you can access here , we talked about Donald Trump, Bible prophecy and the coming global shaking. And believe me when I tell you it's coming. In the 9th chapter of Daniel we see that he finally understands what Israel's Babylonian captivity is all about by reading the prophecy Jeremiah had written. That was Daniel's ※a-ha!§ moment. \n※And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years . And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.§ Jeremiah 25:11,12 (KJV) \nAfter digesting that bombshell , Daniel is then visited by the angel Gabriel who gives Daniel his own shocking prophecy of the Seventy Weeks Of Years. All of that prophecy has been fulfilled except the last week, or 7 year period, known as the time of Jacob's trouble as found in the book of Jeremiah and mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 24 as the time of ※great tribulation§. \n※Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.§ Jeremiah 30:7 (KJV) \n※For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.§ Matthew 24:21 (KJV) \nOn May 14, 2018, Israel will have been officially regathered , in fulfillment of Bible prophecy, for exactly 70 years. In 70 AD, Israel was destroyed by the Romans and the Temple stones toppled to the ground exactly as Jesus said it would happen. When you subtract 70 AD from 2018 AD, where does that leave you? It leaves you square in 1948 AD. Please pause here and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. \nDonald Trump was born on June 14, 1946. If you move ahead 70 years from that date, that brings you to June 14, 2016. Moving forward another seven months brings you to Jan. 14, 2017, and moving forward another seven days brings you to Jan. 21, 2017. This is happening in the year 5777 according to the Jewish calendar. \nAnd if Donald Trump wins the election , Jan. 21 will be his first full day in office. Of course Trump would be inaugurated on Jan. 20, but he would only be president for part of that day. So that means that Donald Trump would be 70 years, seven months and seven days old on his first full day as president of the United States . Please pause here as well, and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. \nAll this brings us to our last point, and here it is. One of the many campaign promises that Donald Trump has made is that he will move the US Embassy in Israel from its current location in Tel Aviv, to its new location in Jerusalem in accordance with the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 . By doing that, the United States will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and thus set off the Psalm 83 War as found in the Bible. \n※They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:§ Psalm 83:4,5 (KJV) \nFor it is Jerusalem, what the Bible calls the ※apple of God's eye§, that the real battle will be fought over. Why do you think that the Palestinians have always rejected the so-called Two State Solution? Because that solution calls for Jerusalem and the Temple Mount to stay with Israel, and the Muslims will not stand for that. They want Jerusalem for the same reason that the Antichrist fights the Battle of Armageddon for it. Because Jerusalem is where Jesus returns to, and where He will rule from for a thousand years. Jerusalem is the reason for all the conflict, all the fighting, all the past wars, and the coming war. \n※Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem. And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.§ Zechariah 12:2,3 (KJV) \nThis election is going to usher in a time of amazing fulfillment of Bible prophecy. It is no coincidence of any kind that Donald Trump will be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day in office. It is not luck, fortune, happenstance or karma that he beat his 16 competitors for the nomination. As I have said for over a year now, Donald Trump is God's man for ※such a time as this§, and that we are living in the days of visible fulfillment of Bible prophecy. \nAs we started our radio show on this topic on this past Sunday night, do you know what the headline story on the Jerusalem Post website was? It was this: Ivanka Trump says her father will move US embassy to Jerusalem ＆100%' if elected \nIf Donald Trump becomes President on Tuesday , as I believe with all my heart he will, then you better start thinking about the time of Jacob's trouble beginning sometime on or around May of 2018. That means the Rapture of the Church will have to happen before that. Please pause here as well, and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. \nAre YOU ready for what comes next? Because, brothers and sisters, it sure looks like it's coming. \nGeoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

After Hillary Clinton posed for photos with the media covering her, she was confused about whether she needed to board the awaiting plane or get in the motorcade that had just dropped her off. \nHillary Clinton was at the White Plains, New York airport about to start her day, when she exhibited some startling behavior . It was the very beginning of her day, so presumably she was rested and alert as she prepared to hit the campaign trail. Yet when speaking with the loud mob of reporters, she appeared to speak gibberish mixed in with her sentences, and laughing awkwardly even though nothing funny was being said. Then it got really weird.

Hillary's Health: More than just a cough \nThe cameras capture her saying ※where am I going§? and then ※what am I doing§? before she disappears into the protective huddle of her watchers. \nThis stands is very stark contrast to am energized Donald Trump, making nearly a dozen stops in a 24 hour period and speaking for almost an hour wherever he goes. Hillary Clinton barely has the energy to get out of her car, and when she does get out, she has no idea what to do after that. \nThis deceitful woman is not only hiding her crimes and scandals , she and her people are also hiding the fact that she is very ill and physically unfit to serve for 4 years as president of the United States.

Both Mexico And Canada Say They're Willing To Redo NAFTA With President Donald Trump Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday he is willing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which US President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to change or scrap. by Geoffrey Grider November 10, 2016 How refreshing is it to have a president who actually wants America to succeed Donald Trump criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement as a U.S. job killer, saying he would be willing to scrap the pact if Canada and Mexico were unwilling to budge. But lo and behold, guess what? Turns out no threats needed as both Mexico and Canada are voluntarily coming to the table right now. Ahh, this is the America I know and love so much.

    "text": "500,000 People Sign Petition Asking Electoral College to Pick Clinton as President Instead of Trump The petition, launched on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected President, calls for the Electoral College to ※ignore their states' votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.§ Although Trump won over the 270 necessary electoral votes to secure the Presidency, Clinton narrowly earned the nation's popular vote.   11, 2016 A petition on Change.org calling for the Electoral College to elect Hillary Clinton as President has earned over half of the signatures needed for it to be sent to the governing body. EDITOR'S NOTE: As stupid as this seems on the surface, at this point, I am not taking anything for granted. Donald Trump voters across America need to be made aware of this, and even now be working against it. Remember that with the Clintons, it's never over. Ever. And as Christopher Stevens and Vince Foster will tell you, these people will stop at nothing. And please be forewarned, while this petition strategy is far-fetched, it is not impossible. The petition , launched on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected President, calls for the Electoral College to ※ignore their states' votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.§ Although Trump won over the 270 necessary electoral votes to secure the Presidency, Clinton narrowly earned the nation's popular vote . The Electoral College  which was first introduced in 1804  is comprised of 538 electors. Each state's number of electors is decided by its number of members in Congress, which is dependent on the state's population. So, when American citizens cast their ballots, they aren't directly voting for president  they're voting for electors. This year, Trump took 279, to Clinton's 228. Petition circulates for Clinton presidency: Most states use a ※winner-take-all§ system when it comes to electoral votes, although there is no Constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote a certain way. Twenty-six states and Washington, D.C., do, however, ※bind§ their electors to vote for the promised candidate on Dec. 19  in this case, Trump. In many cases, ※faithless electors§ are forced to pay a fine if they vote against the popular choice. Understanding what a ※Faithless Elector§ is: \nIn order for Hillary's supporters to be successful, they will need to sway a significant number of the Electoral College to become ※faithless electors§. This video will make it clear what exactly that is and how the process works. Maine and Nebraska follow a different method , called the congressional district method, which allots two electoral votes to the popular vote winner, and additional votes for each congressional district won by the candidates. Crying Hillary Voters Compilation: Faithless electors have not ever reversed the presidency. The Change.org petition, which was at over 500,000 signatures on Thursday afternoon, said that Clinton supporters would be happy to pay any fees accrued by those who choose to be faithless electors. ※Mr. Trump is unfit to serve,§ the petition claimed. ※His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic. Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.§ source",

I am sure that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between Israel and the U.S. and we will bring them to ever greater heights,§ he added.   16, 2016 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is looking forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump on ※the twin interests of peace and security.§ \n※For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.§ 1 Thessalonians 5:3 (KJV) \nEDITOR'S NOTE: After enduring 8 years of a pro-Muslim, anti-Israel president , you can well imagine Benjamin Netanyahu's excitement at a Donald Trump presidency. At the same time, it will be Trump's very support that God will use to usher in some dramatic fulfillment of end times events. As we have been telling you  warning you  for over a year now, when Trump moves the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Israel, get ready to fly. We here at NTEB believe that the move will trigger the Psalm 83 war, or worse, and that the Rapture of the Church will then be right around the corner. If you have something you want to get done for the Lord, do it now. \nIn a satellite address to the Jewish Federations of North America 's annual General Assembly in Washington on Tuesday, Netanyahu urged President Barack Obama to continue America's ※longstanding policy§ of supporting direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, and not pursue other avenues. Israel is concerned that Obama will use his final days in office to push for a UN Security Council resolution that will impose a two-state solution to the conflict. \n※I, for one, find great encouragement in the fact that there's this continuity of friendship,§ Netanyahu said . ※I very much hope that President Obama will continue the policy that he enunciated,§ Netanyahu said, referring to comments made by the outgoing president at the beginning of his first term. ※The only way you get a workable and enduring peace is to have the parties agree to it. This is what has happened with our peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan. PM Netanyahu Congratulates US President-Elect Donald Trump: \n※We've had convulsions in the Middle East, and yet these peace treaties hold because they were directly agreed to by the parties,§ he added. ※The reason we'll object to any such effort is because it will harden the Palestinian position, and because it will harden the Palestinian position, it will push peace back.§ Netanyahu added that he is hoping to nurture the recent ※quiet diplomacy§ Israel has had with Arab nations with the future Trump administration. \nThe day after the Republican candidate rocked the world by winning the election, he invited Netanyahu to visit Washington at the ※first opportunity.§ The prime minister and president-elect ※who have known each other for many years, had a warm, heartfelt conversation§ over the phone, a statement from the Prime Minister's Office said . \nNetanyahu responded by saying that he and his wife Sara were excited to visit the incoming commander-in-chief and his wife Melania. Netanyahu congratulated Trump earlier in the day, calling the president-elect ※a true friend of the State of Israel.§ Donald Trump vows to protect Israel: ※We will work together to advance security, stability and peace in our region,§ Netanyahu said in a statement. \n※The bond between the U.S. and Israel is based on shared values, shared interests and a shared future. I am sure that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between Israel and the U.S. and we will bring them to ever greater heights,§ he added. \nThe son of the late president Shimon Peres, Chemi Peres, also congratulated Trump in his speech to the Jewish Federations General Assembly. \n※I would like to wish President-elect Trump the best of luck,§ he said. ※I am sure he will maintain the unbreakable link between Israel and the U.S., at the core of which are the unwavering support of Israel's security and the forever-extended hand for peace.§ source SHARE THIS ARTICLE",

The U.S. House of Representatives re-authorized last week the Iran Sanctions Act , or ISA, for 10 years. The law was first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Iran's energy industry and deter Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons. The Iran measure will expire at the end of 2016 if it is not renewed. The House bill must still be passed by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama to become law. Iran and world powers concluded the nuclear agreement, also known as JCPOA , last year. It imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear program in return for easing sanctions that have badly hurt its economy.

    "text": "Comments \nDirector James Comey of Federal Bureau of Investigation stirred up a hornet's nest with his decision to interfere in our election by giving House Republicans more ammunition to smear Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over her ※email scandal§ and not even everyone in his own agency is happy about it. \nThe head of the FBI's Agent Association (FBIAA), Reynaldo Tariche , resigned tonight to work in the private sector in protest over Director Comey's decision to use the FBI as a political tool on behalf of Donald Trump. ※Importantly, we will not be used for political gains, and any implication that the FBI Special Agents are unwilling or incapable of performing effective investigations is simply false.'§ \nAnd quit he should. Comey's behavior has been most unbecoming as the head of a federal law enforcement agency who is obligated to remain impartial for the good of our nation. The FBI has no idea what the emails that ※may be pertinent§ that were discovered on disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop actually contain; there was no need to alert Congress and doing so so close to an election is an obvious move to try to tip the scales in favor of the most unqualified and morally abhorrent candidate our nation has ever seen. \nRead his letter here: \nDear Members, \nAfter 26 + years of service for the greatest Law Enforcement organization in the world I am retiring from the FBI today. I have accepted a position in the private sector within the Banking Industry. It has truly been a pleasure and honor to serve with the men and women of the FBI in the relentless pursuit of protecting the American people from Domestic and International threats. I will be eternally grateful to have worked side by side with the most dedicated individuals who carry out the FBI mission 24 hours a day seven days a week. \nMy two terms as President of the FBIAA have been spent in a whirlwind of travel, meetings and other important work on behalf of the members of the FBI AA. It has truly been an amazing journey to witness the incredible work being done on a daily basis by the FBI around the world. Equally impressive has been to see how the FBI family helps each other in times of need including; deaths, family illnesses, natural disasters or any unforeseen tragedy. I am confident that incoming FBIAA President Tom O'Connor, the National Executive Board, and our entire FBIAA team will continue the work of advancing the mission of this incredible organization. \nThe FBIAA's mission includes defending the work and integrity of FBI Special Agents. As a non-partisan organization, comment on political campaigns or candidates is atypical for us, and we intend to keep it that way. Yet, in this intensely partisan election cycle, we find our work〞our integrity〞questioned as it relates to the investigation of Secretary Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Thus, honoring our mission, we will continue to remind federal officials and the public that the FBI Special Agents who undertook this investigation did so with an unwavering focus on complying with the law and the Constitution, as we do with all of our investigations. Importantly, we will not be used for political gains, and any implication that the FBI Special Agents are unwilling or incapable of performing effective investigations is simply false. \nMay God bless the FBI family and may God continue to bless the United States of America",

    "text": "OpEdNews Op Eds 10/28/2016 at 10:15:27 Can any U.S. President Ever Overcome the Power of the Establishment and Bring Substantive Change to America? License DMCA We're finally approaching the end of this long, drawn-out, and very boring process of electing this country's next president. Millions upon millions of Americans are backing either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump in the hope that she or he will bring long-awaited, substantive change to this government and this country. They have been waiting, fervently hoping to finally see some individual who possesses great courage, strong leadership skills, and a deep sense of ethics and morals, become president; and to use the power of the presidency to take this country in an entirely new direction, with a government that adheres to the will of the people. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like either of the two current candidates possesses those qualities and characteristics in abundance sometime in the future we may see such an individual emerge. What kind of real substantive change am I talking about? Well in the latter half of the 20 th Century we saw major accomplishments made during the tenures of various presidents, such as sending a man to the moon, together with important advancements in medicine, science and technology, as well as the creation and development of the internet. Those were very significant achievements but not the kind of substantive changes that greatly impacted the direction of this country. The kind of change of which I speak would be more like the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the creation of the Medicare and Medicaid health care systems in 1965; and in years past, the Social Security system. Here's the type of change this country and society needs as we navigate the 21 st century. First and foremost we need to see very ambitious government/business efforts and programs to create millions jobs for Americans. That would help greatly to reinvigorate the middle class and jumpstart our sluggish economy; it would also result in significant reductions in the number of Americans who are dependent on food stamps and other forms of government welfare. - Advertisement - Such a program should include the repair and modernization of our deteriorating national infrastructure, the development of solar and wind power, and the creation of a universal health care system that would finally cover all Americans at much lower costs. We need substantive changes in the way we deal with rampant violence in this country; this problem has been escalating and its way past time that something were done to curtail the proliferation and illegal use of guns that are slaughtering far too many of our innocent fellow Americans. But so far the government and, in particular, this Congress, has refused to address this situation because of the power wielded by the gun industry and the NRA. That continued governmental vacillation combined with NRA obstructive tactics must not be allowed to continue. A large majority of Americans would like to see real, substantive changes such as those identified above put into effect; and all of them are clearly doable. However, that's just not happening because there is a massive, seemingly immovable object standing in the way. That object of obstruction is, of course, the Establishment, which is diametrically opposed to any such progress because its own objectives clash with those of the people. It is very difficult and virtually impossible for any president to overcome the power of this Establishment because of what I refer to as the Circle of Power and Control that exists in Washington; here's how this ultra-powerful, self-perpetuating circle operates; - Advertisement - At the seat of this power is Corporate America which uses monumental amounts of $$$ to influence and control our elections so that a large majority of elected senators and representatives return to the Congress time and again; not to advance the needs of the people but, rather, the interests and objectives of Corporate America. We might refer to these politicians as indentured servants. The Corporatists want to slash corporate taxes to further increase profits, to significantly water down the regulations and restrictions on the banking industry., They support the lobbyists and special interest groups that have infiltrated this Congress and are, not only greatly influencing the enactment of legislation, but are often actually writing it. Congress has, as a very top priority, the ongoing funding of the massive Military-Industrial Complex, i.e., the Pentagon, the CIA, the State and \"Defense\" Departments, and the defense industry corporations which produce the machinery of war. Too many taxpayer dollars that should be used to strengthen this country's deteriorating foundations are, instead, directed to the military establishment to maintain its huge empire of bases and installations all over the world, to conduct invasions and occupations of other nations, and to remove elected leaders and/or dictators in various countries.",

    "text": "- Advertisement - What the heck was FBI Director James Comey thinking? Three emails found with the name \"Clinton\" in them on disgraced, serial genitals photographer, Anthony Weiner's computer, amounts to an investigation tantamount to and obliquely suggestive of criminal behavior. Not satisfied to insert himself and the FBI into the political maelstrom of the 2106 presidential campaign, FBI Director, James B. Comey, a lifelong Republican, has now made himself and the agency a complete laughing stock in its dealings with Hillary Rodham Clinton. He should do the right thing and resign over this monumental fumble that reeks of political Republican bias. I find it very hard to see just how he's going to continue effectively running the FBI when he's done so much to undermine its legendary independency and penchant for secrecy that has made it one of the most feared and respected law enforcement agencies in the world. Now Comey's action has rendered this proud and efficient agency as a dopey version of the Keystone Kops. A kind of Uncle Gadget-like approach to anything Clinton perhaps a reaction by political osmosis contaminated by his brethren in the Congress. The unprecedented FBI press conference before his congressional hearing led by his witch-hunting party, turned out to be an expensive joke as the so-called secret information gleaned from a private email server in Hillary Clinton's basement could only yield a few lines of \"confidential\" classification. This forced Comey and his angry Republican kin in Congress to express outrage that he did not have HRC charged, well, for \"something.\" Never mind the EVIDENCE of deliberate criminal action was a scarce as a Dodo bird. Comey, perhaps smarting at the stinging rebuke from his cohorts in Congress who thought that he was letting her off the hook or that he was \"a sell out,\" might have wanted to get back in their good books by sending a letter so immature and, well, stupid, as to draw peals of uncontrolled fits of laughter if this was not the end of a unique presidential election. It is serious when the head of the FBI writes Congress and hints of something nefarious. Eleven days out and Comey springs his \"October Surprise\" perhaps trying to send a subtle dog whistle to Republican voters that HRC \"might, perhaps, could be\" dragged up on unnamed and unspecified criminal charged so, by default, vote for Donald Trump. How else is this to be interpreted? The timing, the vagueness, \"draw your own conclusioness\" of the letter, and the careful use of language that was not definitive or direct but with enough spin to suggest that there MIGHT BE SOMETHING AMISS THERE -- at last! But the Comey revelation and clumsy letter writing immediately backfired when it was revealed that the computer was NOT HRC's own, and had all to do with the silly little twit named one Anthony Weiner, whose penchant for making himself an utter ass is without parallel. Poor HRC had NOTHING to do with this. Almost immediately the Republican amen chorus that was singing the demise of HRC and the praises of the Orange-haired One, gulped air like a fish stranded on dry land. The self-righteous, chest thumping, and the gleeful orgasmic teetering that welcomed this new HRC \"email revelation\" and fumble ended as immediately as it started. Nah, that was definitely not the political manna from heaven that these bozos were desperately praying for. That and a bolt of God-fearing, Bible-brimstone-and-fire lightening to strike the Demon HRC! - Advertisement - Within two hours the semi-hard doo-doo struck the proverbial fan scattering its stench on the faces of Comey, Trump, Paul Ryan and all of the mainstream media pundits and anchors who rushed so quickly to judgment and pulled out their lariats to hang HRC from the nearest tree. With stinky egg on their goofy faces and sheepish grins all around, HRC marched (the Rasta men would say \"trod\") to the microphones and demanded that Comey and the Keystone Kops release the emails. Show and tell the American people she demanded -- ladylike. That's called \"calling your bluff.\" And, by crickey! She's an old hand at that! Again she demonstrated and proved --once more (how many times does she have to freakin' prove it?) that she is as fit as a fiddle to be president of the United States. The bunch of childish, clownish clumsy boys that she's had to fend off all of her life looked sullen and morose. Chest-fallen -- I like that word! I could hear them crying: Bummer! We sure thought that we had her this time! And just as immediately the calls came for Comey to explain and resign. He's the fall guy, the patsy, the one who wrote the letter. Serves him right! The feisty, petite dynamo showed just how big her cajones are and just how tough she is by COMPLETELY IGNORING Donald Trump's Twitter tantrums, Paul Ryan's hot-and-cold silliness, Mitch McConnell's growing senility, and the rest of the GOP's sorry-brigade pouting and mammy bellowing and wailing. What a gal! She does not have to yell, scream, and get the FBI director to do something foolish to win this election. Madame, you have withstood this unnecessary, unfair, unjust, unprincipled and undemocratic attacks, targeted maligning and political obsession with you and then some. If you were a man subjected to the same level of attacks you would have certainly cracked already. You make these guys look as so many wimps and wusses. But you're made of sterner stuff. We who have watched and followed your stellar and outstanding career know that only too well. Comey by his really, really poor lack of judgment and bad political calculations has just strengthened your position. The thing backfired and has now blown up in their collective faces. You should laugh out loud -- but not now. Wait until November 8 and then have a big, hearty Hillary Clinton laugh from you feet on up. For now it's the home stretch and you're almost there. - Advertisement -",

    "title": "The Lesser of Two Evils: why Noam Chomsky is wrong in advocating this principle in the 2016 US Presidential Election",
    "text": "The Lesser of Two Evils(image by Mark John Maguire) License DMCA \nIt has become common in recent days, in which the 2 leading candidates for the US Presidential election have achieved unfavourable poll ratings, to regard voting for either candidate as a vote for the \"Lesser of Two Evils\" (LEV). Tempting though it may be to vote for a candidate simply in the hope of excluding another, this is a questionable ethical policy with potential risks for democracy. The \"Lesser of 2 Evils\" principle (LEV) has a long history of application in US Foreign Policy in promoting intervention in wars to exclude a \"worse evil\". So ingrained has this aspect of Realpolitik become in the US political psyche that it has become axiomatic of US public polity in the conduct of government. It has recently been promoted as such by Noam Chomsky who, in an uncharacteristically weak argument, has exhorted the left in the US to vote for Hillary Clinton. \nBut Chomsky is wrong as is the political philosophy underpinning LEV which prevails as a result of its widespread acceptance in the US political Establishment and his argument exhibits many of the blind assumptions made concerning LEV. The principal area in which LEV is cited is in US Foreign Policy and a casual glance at its operation here gives a sense of the problems with it as an ethical system: Vietnam, , Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya have all been subjected to horrific bombing, invasion and military degradation by successive US governments on the basis that to do so represented the LEV. There are few today even in the US who, with the benefit of hindsight, would concur that in its application in the US Foreign Policy sphere LEV can be supported as a sound ethical principle. There are indeed, many outside of the US who would regard its support of LEV to be an evil in itself. Clearly, there are other motivations for US invasions other than LEV considerations - not least geopolitical motives - but the adherence to LEV has enabled successive US govts to conduct a programme of widespread military aggression which it would otherwise have had few means of justifying. It has come to be the primary means of justifying a brutality that is rampant in the US and which successive Presidents have subscribed to wholeheartedly with disastrous consequences for the world. \nCertainly LEV is a persuasive argument to governments facing complex issues and situations both domestically and abroad, but it is fraught with difficulties. A clear example of a sound application of LEV could be considered to be with the institution of the police force: police forces restrain liberty for the benefit of all because without them there would be a degree of lawlessness not compatible with the functioning of civilised society: it may thus be said that police forces are the LEV: a loss of liberty (evil) is incurred to avoid lawlessness (greater evil). But that brings us to the crux of the matter: LEV seems to have a reasonable application where there are 2 options and not more. If we apply it to situations were there are more than 2 options then we run into difficulty. In the case of policing it is apparent that there is no third way - or at least no-one has yet found one. LEV can therefore be safely applied in this instance. Again, in the situation where a knife-wielding madman approaching a group of school children can be disabled by running him down in a vehicle, we see an appropriate application of LEV because there seems to be no third way - and thus a great evil may be avoided by opting for a lesser evil. Were it possible to prevent the knifeman by, say, shutting the school gates, then this would remove the act of running him down from the LEV principle, because there would be 3 possibilities. If a policeman with a taser device was observed approaching then we would be in possession of a number of options: we would then have a complex moral decision to which LEV would be an unhelpful and possibly harmful remedy. That is because we would be seeking to apply a simple response to a complex problem which would potentially be detrimental and may result in a poor moral choice being made. Scaling up to the case where a conflict between the US and another country arises, there are myriad options available and by virtue of this LEV is not a good moral principle to apply. The situation in any of the recent examples of countries attacked by the US in the past 50 years has never been an either/or situation. Indeed, such situations have been subject to widespread arguments and protests concerning other options. The fact that LEV has been used to justify war, bombing, intervention etc is a testament to its misapplication rather than its wrongness as a principle per se, but given the complexity of international relations it is probably safe to regard LEV as unlikely to be applicable to most issues. \nThere are also severe problems with LEV in its application in the public sphere aside from these practical considerations: \n1. By suggesting that evil can be right when it is the \"lesser evil\" it unwittingly endorses the principle of \"the end justifies the means\". This principle, which has been central to Western ethical thinking for at least 2000 years, is deeply flawed and it has - unsurprisingly - been used by many dictators as a means to justify an act, however bad, provided the ultimate outcome is good. For whom that outcome may be judged to be good, in what circumstances, by what measure and in what timescale are some of the many just criticisms of this notion of \"consequentialism\". It seems wrong intuitively for finite humans to accept such an indeterminate version of \"consequentialism\" in ethical decision making. There must be an applicability of timescale for consequences; there needs also to be a measure of the act in its intention as well as its consequence if we are to have a well balanced and sound ethical principle. By placing the matter of the ethical value of an act on the consequences alone, the intentions are effectively removed and an act is judged entirely on its outcome - it is not hard to imagine malign circumstances which have worked out well by chance. For example, if we judged a bank robbery which had gone awry by the inadvertent consequence of uncovering a stash of terrorist weapons in the bank vault, we may be pleased to have discovered the plot, but we would hardly be likely to applaud the robbers. It does seem that the consequence must, at the very least, be intended and it seems reasonable to argue that the end of a moral act cannot be the sole measure of its value - of course there is also a practical difficulty in that by the time the outcome of many acts can be weighed against the acts themselves, it is no longer of much practical use to do so! In such cases we must rely heavily on intention . \n2. LEV involves another major problem: if both options consist of evil consequences it could only be justifiable to select one on the basis that there was no other choice . If there were other choices available then it may be argued that the LEAST evil choice was the ethical option, although the introduction of a third element would cause exponential difficulties because it would introduce other considerations such as expediency, practicality and judgements concerning relative likelihood of successful outcome. Where LEV is applied to multiple choice complex situations involving moral decisions, it is therefore a crass and inappropriate response to a situation, since it simplifies and deliberately excludes other possible solutions. - Advertisement - \n3. LEV also requires heavy qualification because it is frequently used as an excuse to justify doing evil, rather than considering other options - thus in this sense it is an unethical principle when inappropriately applied. LEV must be applied to dire exigencies by its very nature for if the exigency were not urgent then action would hardly be necessary. We should also be careful to ensure that situations are properly identified as LEV situations. If we take the situation where I am in a lifeboat and there is room for only one other passenger apart from myself and there is an old man in the water and a child - which of these should I save? The other must drown. Certainly there are 2 evils present and prima facie we have a LEV situation, but on closer examination we see that there are undoubtedly other options available - I may give up my own place to them both and accept my own drowning, or I may try to accommodate both even though we may all drown and accept the increased risk of this etc. There are a number of judgements here which must be made and which affect the decision - judgements based on assumptions of what will happen; that one is more worthy of saving than the other and so forth: it is thus a complex moral decision which will require a difficult choice but is deserving of a complex consideration for that reason. Given that such decisions would be unusual in the extreme and that we would be required to act quickly rather than to sit in the boat considering the matter while both drowned, it is unlikely that the impact on the world would be great! Certainly it does not assume the great impact that LEV takes on in its application in the Public sphere where large numbers of people are affected. \nThis brings us to the use of LEV in democratic elections and it proves to be as dubious in its application here as it is in its use in Foreign affairs. Representative democracy is dependent on the notion of freedom of choice so that the best candidate may be elected. Anything which inhibits this undermines that principle. LEV, by its very nature, does so: rather than promoting contest between the best in the freest manner possible, it promotes the least bad option from a narrow choice, constraining and distorting the freedom of choice of the voter. That is a denial of democratic principle; if it is applied when there are other choices available, that distortion becomes even greater so that we may justly inquire whether the limited form of democracy we possess in its representative form is worthy of the name democracy at all. We should also consider that democratic elections require myriad assumptions and judgements to be made and are not therefore susceptible (nor should they be) to evil and \"less evil\" considerations. Furthermore, b ecause ethical values are by no means clear in themselves or invested simply in one candidate or another, then such judgements made are themselves complex and deserving of such treatment. \nNoam Chomsky, with John Halle, has argued that LEV should be used in the 2016 US Presidential election and his argument is worthy of examination: Chomsky provides some general caveats by way of providing a soft-landing for his assumption of LEV and these are deeply flawed. First, to the argument that Clinton's Foreign Policy may be worse than Trump's, he advances the claim that \"following the logic through seems to require a vote for Trump\"! That is an astonishing non-sequitur! It makes no such requirment and can be used simply as a means of eviscerating the claims that Clinton IS the LEV in this respect, without leading to an endorsement of Trump in the wider aspect. It may equally contribute to a decision to abstain from voting or to vote for a 3rd party. \nSecond, he refers to \"The politics of moral witness\" (the argument that LEV remains evil and should not be engaged) which he counters by stating that the point of voting for LEV is to do \"Less\" evil which is an \"obvious rejoinder\". Perhaps it may seem so, but it is a \"circulus in demonstrandum\" type of fallacy to make such a criticism! It only seems right to someone who is already signed up to the notion of LEV - but to others it is simply evincing a premise as a proof of that which it seeks to confirm! \nThirdly, Chomsky goes on to state \"The basic moral principle at stake is simple: not only must we take responsibility for our actions, but the consequences of our actions for others are a more important consideration than feeling good about ourselves\". The first proposition is good - the second half has strayed from its purpose somewhat: it appears in part to try to lessen the effect of personal responsibility by stating that consequences should be regarded as more important than intentions. That is a dangerous argument. Even at a common sense level intention is given great value in human relations - often to the detriment of consequences: and this is right, because as we have seen, consequences by their nature are often unpredictable and involve many assumptions, prejudices and involve many matters not always relevant to the decision itself. \"I will bomb Iraq because it will lead to a safer world and rid us and its people of an evil regime\" (I purposely introduce a contentious and familiar issue here) plays out like this: my intention is good, but I have introduced some assumptions which involve great leaps of faith and logic: ie, the consequence of bombing (bad) in producing a safe world (good) justifies my action. We can see very easily where such an argument goes awry in its practical and recent application in human history. It is not safe or justifiable to take arguments beyond their remit. Viewed by intention alone the decision may be seen as good or bad depending on one's point of view; by the consequences alone (deaths of many innocent people, destruction of a nation and its infrastructure) it is clearly an evil: does this imply that had the outcome of the war been good the war would have been a good one? It seems that the intention must play heavily on the judgement and a proper balance must be observed between intention and consequence in judging the action, especially as we could not possibly know the outcome. Of course we are setting aside the notion that Iraq was not a true LEV situation since there were actions which could be taken which were considerably less evil, but the example serves to demonstrate that intention and consequence cannot easily be separated in weighing the ethical value of an action. Therefore it seems fair to alter Chomsky's proposition to \"We must take responsibility for our actions which should have intrinsic good as their basis and CONSIDER the consequences as a corollary to this\". That is as far as an ethical argument can take us. - Advertisement - \nA final criticism of LEV, says Chomsky, is equating it with \"passive acquiescence to the bipartisan status quo\" and he attacks this by stating that LEV can be defended by the fact that \"poorly considered electoral decisions impose a cost\" and then goes on to give some subjective examples of Nixon's continuation of the Vietnam war. But this is unjustifiable by the same measures we have considered in applying assumptions and prejudices to previous arguments, for it can quite as easily be argued that an alternative to Nixon MIGHT have produced a different adminsitration; indeed, that it MIGHT have produced an alternative ending to the Vietnam war - but it might not: recent US history is not over-filled with instances in which different electoral results produced different policies! In the case of Vietnam it can be argued that the war was a war of the US Establishment - and surely no-one prosecuted that war with greater vigour and determination than democrat President LBJ? The difficulty with such examples is that we move into the realms of pure speculation in guessing what the alternative might have been. We could equally claim that the 1968 outcome may have averted nuclear war due to the initiation of the SALT negotiations by Nixon - but we should not do so, because to bring such unknowns which are dependent on so many different variables into the equation, takes us into the arena of pure political speculation and little else. \nCritique of Chomsky's 8-point argument: \n1) \"Voting should not be directed as a form of personal self-expression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values, or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites.\" \nThe immediate response to this is to ask: \"Is not it a matter for my personal integrity to choose my reason for voting?\" Surely my reasons for voting (or not doing so) should be determined by my view of the system, the candidates and other matters and it should not be dictated to me that I must vote, in any circumstances, whosoever the candidates may be?\" There may be very good reasons why a voter may wish to vote for a candidate including those of moral, social or personal affinity and such reasons should be respected as legitimate - even though I may have my own personal view of why and how people should vote. It seems perfectly reasonable to vote as a means of self-expression, moral judgement or even of disapprobation towards one or more candidates and certainly as part of the calculation in making a judgement as to who to vote for. Chomsky's personal injunction here is no more than an expression of his personal preference and has no validity beyond that, evinces no proof in support of its validity and is of questionable morality.",
