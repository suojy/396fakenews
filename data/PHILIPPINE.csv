Turkey can go too. This is right, and not only for warmongerers reasons! But we also should not forget that these miniature states are only used too, like the rest of dumb europe. By the anglo-american axis, some call it meanwhile the new axis of evil. Bceause, for the simple reason that russia didn∩t break made promises, after the Globalists ""reunited"" Germany, let∩s better say brought down the wall(To be honest, there is no unity between german people, often not even in the own families, less than ever between the east and west of germany). The broken promises were about the eastward enlargement of the NATO. NATO's Eastward Expansion Did the West Break Its Promise to Moscow? ""Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has accused the West of breaking promises made after the fall of the Iron Curtain, saying that NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe violated commitments made during the negotiations over German reunification. Newly discovered documents from Western archives support the Russian position."" Russia didn∩t expand his military troops to the borders of the USA or UK, didn∩t build a rocket shield in Mexico, Canada or elsewhere at the borders of the USA. I read right now that Orban acts the same like Erdolf aka Erdogan. The last hungarian newspaper that reported about the criminal acts of the Orban family, the ""N谷pszabads芍g"" was closed down, freedom of the press is almost terminated now. And those EU puppets send taxmoney to such states and get nothing but problems back, but don∩t even try to stop such Hobby Hitlers. Good that Erdolfistan is not in the EU like hungaria and the other ""want revenge from russia"" liliputh states. And the people that elected Orban, just for anti-refugee and othe Nazi reasons, for nothing else? Another year under Orban and they will end as refugees in western europe! That will become embarrassing for the anti-refugee masses... To come to an end. It∩s obvisiously the ""west"" who is playing foul, playing foul and nothing else than that, at least since 9/11. The anglo-american axis(the modern mass surveillance pioneers) is surrounding russia, not russia the ""west""(and is using it∩s idiot european ""partners"" for this). It∩s not russia that covers every part of the world with his military and his eavesdrop stations. It∩s not russia that ""owns"" almost unsinkable aircraft carries like Germany(38.500 US troops in germany), for example. It∩s not russia that stores nuke in germany, that we germans aren∩t even allowed to own or store on our territory. The NSA isn∩t russian. TTIP, CETA, NAFTA, TISA and all that, isn∩t russian. The bankster crash 2008 was not based in russia. The robber baron capitalism that ""feeds"" a few but exploits 99,9% is not coming from communism(though they learned fast how it works).

MANILA, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) 每 This is a tutorial on how to ride the jeepney which is an important mode of mass transportation in many cities and towns in the Philippines. 
Many of you may already be familiar with these rules, etiquette and tricks but for those who are visiting the country for the first time or are returning nationals (balikbayan) who have been away for a long time, you might want to keep this tutorial handy. First of all, not all jeepneys you encounter are as colorful, shiny and clean as the one pictured here. If you are bothered by smoke or the smell of gasoline, remember to always carry and wear a disposable surgical mask. It also helps with, you know, body odor. In most cases, there are no jeepney stops like there are bus stops. Wherever you are, be rest assured that so long as there is room for one more passsenger, the jeepney will stop for you. Speaking of room, when the driver says the capacity of his jeepney is 10 passengers on either side, you can＊t argue. Ten means ten, even if only half your butt sits comfortably on the padded seat. Only cash payment is accepted, but you probably already know that. Exact fare is appreciated but Mr. Driver is happy to provide change except very early in the day. ※Barya lang po sa umaga!§ No five hundred peso bills in the morning, please. Jeepney fare is passed on from one passenger to another until it reaches the driver. The same is true for any change back due the passenger. It takes a village to ride the jeepney you know. If you don＊t want to be bothered by other passengers asking you to pass on the fare to the driver, sit as far as possible from the driver, assuming that premium spot is vacant. The jeepney driver would appreciate it so much if you pay your fare before you start texting on your mobile phone. ※God knows who doesn＊t pay,§ says one jeepney sign. There are two phrases you need to learn when riding the jeepney: ※Bayad po§ (here＊s my fare) and ※Para po§ (this is my stop). If you don＊t speak the language, no worries. Just pass on your fare to the passenger next to you and he or she will know what to do. And if you need to disembark, just knock on the jeepney＊s roof. It also means ※please stop.§ There are discounted fares for students and seniors. Be sure to say ※one senior§ or ※one student§ when paying your fare. Otherwise, you pay full fare. Filipinos have learned to respect seniors and people with disabilities. The spot closest to the jeepney entrance (farthest from the driver) is reserved for them. Isn＊t that nice? As always, hold on to the hand rails. It can be a very bumpy ride.

WASHINGTON, D.C.

That is, of course, assuming the Clintons will continue to retain her services. 
It would be pancit, that signature noodle dish closely identified with the Philippines.

MAKATI CITY, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles) 每 When completed by the end of 2016, the Trump Tower in the Philippines will be among the country＊s tallest buildings . But the Trump name may disappear from this upscale residential building. 
Launched in 2012, Trump Tower is a joint venture between Century Properties and the Trump Organization. It will be managed by Century Properties Management Inc. To rise at 250 meters above ground, the 56-story building is designed by award-winning international architectural firm Broadway Malyan. 
※It＊s really just an iconic, modern building, very tall, very chic, something that really symbolizes everything that a Trump project means,§ said Eric Trump, son of Donald, and executive vice president of development and acquisition. 
It is located at the corner of Kalayaan Avenue and Salamanca Street in Makati City. 
But today, Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte issued an executive order canceling the building permit of the Trump Tower. 
Duterte called Donald Trump and his organization ※persona non grata§ for the Republican presidential candidate＊s recent comments about the Philippines. 
It will be recalled that in one of his campaign speeches, Trump lumped the Philippines with other countries with terrorism links, calling for the banning Filipinos from immigrating to the United States. Duterte even challenged Trump to a fist fight. 
※If we, Filipinos, are not welcome in the United States, why would we welcome Trump in the Philippines,§ Duterte said. 
Asked by The Adobo Chronicles what the Philippine government plans to do with the Trump Tower, Duterte replied, ※I will make it a rehabilitation center for the more than half a million Filipino drug users who surrendered as part of my war on drugs.§

MANILA, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) 每 Rappler CEO Maria Ressa＊s widely-quoted statement, ※Time to take back the Internet§ might just come back to haunt her. Just in time for Halloween. 
Ressa has been very vocal about the proliferation of ※fake§ news sites and trolls that have left her online news organization lagging behind in terms of followers and reader engagements.

Article XVI, Section 11 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution specifically states that the mass media must be wholly-owned and managed by citizens of the Philippines. 
But Rappler is partly-owned by a foreign company, Omidyar Network. How do we know? Rappler itself told us so way back on November 5, 2015:

DES MOINES, Iowa ( The Adobo Chronicles) 每 Since he launched his bid to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald Trump has made many promises, but nothing has caught the attention of the media and electorate more than what he said today in Iowa, on the eve of the first caucus of the 2016 presidential elections season.

The Adobo Chronicles asked Trump what will happen to the media and the White House press corps when he travels across the country or abroad. 
※Well, they just have to book their own commercial flights and follow me around,§ he said. 
Thousands of miles away in the Philippines, a leading presidential candidate said that if elected president, he will not live in Malaca?ang 〞 the Filipino counterpart of the White House 〞 because he likes to sleep in his own bed. His bed is in Davao City of which he is currently the mayor.

A Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) analysis of newly released data from the Census Bureau＊s American Community Survey (ACS) shows that 1.5 million new immigrants (legal and illegal) settled in the country in 2014. The number who entered in 2014 represent an increase of 38 percent over the number who were arriving as recently as 2011. The findings confirm a CIS study published in June of this year based on other data showing a surge in legal and illegal immigration in 2014 and 2015. Newly arrived immigrants include new green card holders (permanent residents); long-term ※temporary§ visitors who often stay permanently, such as guest workers and foreign students; and new illegal immigrants. 
View the entire report here . 
※The data makes clear that the slowdown in immigration that occurred after the Great Recession is over,§ said the Center＊s Director of Research Steven Camarota. He added, ※many of these new arrivals are guest workers brought in at the behest of the business community. Whether this is in the best interest of American workers or the country as a whole is a question seldom asked in Washington.§ 
? Newly released data show 1.5 million new immigrants (legal and illegal) arrived in 2014. Data released for the first six months of 2015 indicates that 1.6 million new immigrants likely arrived in 2015. 
? The number who arrived in 2014 represents a 17% increase over the number who came in 2013 and a 38 percent increase over the low point in 2011. 
? Between two-third and three-fourths of the 1.5 million new immigrants settling in the country are legal immigrants, including permanent residents as well as long-term visitors (e.g. guest workers and foreign students). The remainder are new illegal immigrants. 
? The overall immigrant population grew about twice as fast from 2013 to 2015 as it did in the prior four years, hitting a new record high of 43.3 million. 
? It is important to note that arrivals are offset by those immigrants who leave the country each year and by normal mortality of about 300,000 annually among the existing immigrant population. Therefore, growth in the overall immigrant population is less than new arrivals. 
? As a share of the U.S. population, 13.5 percent are now immigrants每the highest percentage in 105 years. As recently as 1970, less than 5 percent of the population were immigrants. 
? Based on current trends and Census Bureau projections, the immigrant share of the population is on track to surpass the highest level in American history seven years from now. 
? Sending regions with the largest numerical increases in immigrants living in the United States since 2010 were East Asia (up 847,000), South Asia (up 825,000), the Caribbean (up 434,000), Sub-Saharan Africa (up 390,000), the Middle East (up 362,000), and Central America (up 332,000). The number of European immigrants declined by 31,000. 
?

LOS ANGELES TIMES 
Casino operators know there are no gamblers quite like the Chinese. 
With their affinity for baccarat, the most lucrative game in Las Vegas, Chinese gamblers have long commanded special treatment 〞 be it with private Chinese gaming salons, Lunar New Year festivities or performances from pop stars flown in from Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
No one in Las Vegas, however, has built a casino and hotel strictly for Chinese visitors until now. 
The Lucky Dragon Hotel & Casino is billing itself as Las Vegas＊ first Asian-themed resort, funded in large part by Chinese investors. The property, set to open Dec. 3 with a traditional lion dance, will offer bilingual staff and signage, a luxury tea bar and a host of restaurants with food that wouldn＊t look or taste out of place in Guangzhou or Shanghai. 
※No General Tso＊s or egg rolls here,§ said David Jacoby, chief operating officer for the resort, which left no Chinese superstition unturned. 
The rose-colored resort＊s front entrance is designed in a dragon motif. A feng shui master blessed its kitchens. The main bar is eight-sided for good fortune. And it＊s hard to find a No. 4 on the property. The unlucky digit is absent from room numbers and the phone directory. The nine-story hotel even skips a fourth floor. 
※This place is heavily feng shui＊ed§ Jacoby said. 
With all that attention to detail, you＊d think Lucky Dragon＊s brain trust was born in Beijing. But the idea behind the 203-room boutique resort off the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip was largely conceived by an American veteran gaming executive, Bill Weidner, the former president and chief operating officer of Las Vegas Sands Corp. 
Weidner, an advisor to Lucky Dragon, is no neophyte to the Chinese market. He worked with some of China＊s most powerful government figures to lead Sands＊ expansion into Macau when the former Portuguese colony relaxed its monopoly on gaming licenses in 2002. Macau now generates nearly five times the gambling revenue of the Las Vegas Strip, forever changing the fortunes of the global casino industry. 
Weidner was also involved in the development of the $5.5-billion Marina Bay Sands in Singapore before leaving the company in a bitter dispute in 2009. 
Weidner and Jacoby know major Las Vegas gaming resorts like the Sands＊ Venetian, MGM or Wynn already cater to China＊s high rollers with VIP parlors and relationships forged in Macau. 
Lucky Dragon, though tiny compared with those properties, addresses what they see as a gap in the market: middle-class Chinese gamblers, Chinese Americans as well as the broader Asian American community. 
※Let them fight over the 1% and let us fight over the remaining 99%,§ said Jacoby, who previously worked for Weidner＊s firm, Global Gaming Asset Management, opening a casino resort in the Philippines. 
That pool of Chinese gamers will almost certainly grow. On Dec. 2, Hainan Airlines will fly the first direct flights from China to Las Vegas＊s McCarran International Airport (Lucky Dragon guests are confirmed to be on that flight, Jacoby said). 
Already, a record 206,743 visitors from China traveled to Las Vegas last year, nearly double the number in 2010, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. 
Meanwhile, ground was broken on another Asian-themed resort, this one much bigger than Lucky Dragon. Resorts World, a Malaysian hospitality and casino giant with decades of Asian gaming experience, is spending up to $4 billion for a 3,200-room property on the North Strip that will feature Chinese architecture such as an ersatz Great Wall. It＊s slated to open in 2019. 
Plans are also underway to build a $2-billion resort on the Strip called Alon Las Vegas. The project is owned by Australia＊s Crown Resort, who count Chinese gamers as a major source of business. 
※It＊s going to be even more of a competitive market,§ said John DeCree, an analyst at Union Gaming in Las Vegas. ※Everyone＊s coming for the same customer. It＊s going to be a challenge.§ With 203 rooms, the hotel is small compared with many on the Strip. But with five restaurants, it offers more dining options than many its size. (Isaac Brekken / For The Times) 
Competition could also be fierce for Chinese high rollers, whose gambling activity has been curtailed by a slowing Chinese economy and an anti-corruption campaign at home that, until recently, sent Macau gambling revenues into a two-year slump. 
Las Vegas isn＊t immune to those headwinds. After years of explosive growth, casinos on the Strip experienced a decline in the amount of money bet on baccarat to about $10 billion in 2015. That＊s nearly $2 billion less than 2014, according to the Nevada Gaming Control Board. 
The casino industry uses the card game as a proxy for Chinese gambling activity because of its massive popularity within the culture. That＊s both for practical and superstitious reasons. Baccarat has the best statistical odds of beating the house compared with other games. And as a game of chance over skill, baccarat also plays into Chinese fatalistic attitudes toward luck. 
※The vast majority of baccarat play comes from the Asian market,§ said Jacoby of Lucky Dragon. 
Jacoby＊s casino will offer seven VIP baccarat tables on a second-floor terrace with access to a vast menu of authentic Chinese food. In addition to live seafood flown in from all over the world, the property will serve staples like congee, wonton noodles and dim sum. 
Food is expected to be a big draw because Chinese vacationers overwhelmingly prefer their native cuisine over others. 
Las Vegas has a number of well-regarded Chinese restaurants such as Ping Pang Pong at Gold Coast Hotel & Casino, China MaMa in Chinatown and an outpost of Chengdu Taste, the San Gabriel Valley stalwart for Sichuan cuisine. High-end Chinese food is also served at high-roller rooms such as the Venetian＊s Paiza Club. 
No casino, however, boasts the concentration of Chinese restaurants that Lucky Dragon will, with five altogether. The hope is Chinese tourists staying at other properties will choose to eat 〞 and gamble 〞 at Lucky Dragon when they venture off the Strip. 
The emphasis on food means Lucky Dragon＊s owners can eschew things that aren＊t particularly important to Chinese tourists, like a whiskey bar or nightclub. And because Chinese tourists often don＊t like to sunbathe, Lucky Dragon＊s pool isn＊t much bigger than the backyard variety. 
Jacoby says his competitors on the Strip offer Chinese gamers a diluted experience by operating a handful of Chinese restaurants and parlors in mega-casinos that have to serve all manner of people, not just Chinese. By comparison, visitors to Lucky Dragon can start conversing in Mandarin with staff as soon as they walk in, he said. 
※We＊re trying to take [the Asian gaming experience] and bring that front and center instead of hiding the most valuable customer in a segregated portion of a large building,§ Jacoby said. 
Though Lucky Dragon will rely heavily on Asian American customers at first, its funding was largely drawn from mainland Chinese investors through the federal EB-5 visa program. The visa allows foreigners and their immediate family to gain permanent U.S. residency in exchange for a minimum investment of $500,000 that also creates American jobs. Rather than focusing on bars and nightclubs, the casino is prioritizing dining options. That includes a tea room, still under construction. (Isaac Brekken / For The Times) 
Chinese investors have dominated the program nationwide, accounting for 80% of applicants awaiting EB-5 visas. Though occasionally subject to fraud, the program has successfully funded a handful of mixed-used projects in New York, the JW Marriott hotel at L.A. Live and the SLS Hotel & Casino across from Lucky Dragon. 
Jacoby declined to say how many Chinese investors are involved in Lucky Dragon, which is expected to employ 800 people. Jacoby also declined to disclose how much the project cost, adding that earlier media reports pegging the price tag at about $370 million were inaccurate. 
The company hit a snag last year when it unsuccessfully sought tax subsidies from the city. But financial commitments from Weidner＊s family and others put the project back on track. 
Lucky Dragon isn＊t the first Las Vegas resort to target a specific demographic. The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino and the Palms Casino Resort opened years ago catering to young partygoers and clubbers before eventually being overshadowed by larger competitors on the Strip such as the MGM Grand and the Cosmopolitan. 
Lucky Dragon＊s early backers even considered building an LGBT resort before settling on their current strategy, one they say will live and die on being able to deliver an authentic Chinese gambling experience. 
※We set out trying to put together a place that would stand alone in Shanghai if you dropped it off down there today,§ Jacoby said. ※We didn＊t want to [have] just gongs, Asian tapestries and caricature-stuff like that.§",english,2016-10-27T15:20:32.738+03:00,amtvmedia.com,US,,New Las Vegas Casino ONLY for Chinese Gamblers,0,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/la-1477006617-snap-photo.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Looking over the global landscape, the areas most touched by US interventionist foreign policy are objectively in the worst, most desperate shape. The mainstream media will report that the current disaster in Syria came about because the people decided to stand up to a cruel dictator in the ※Arab Spring§ that swept through the greater Middle East in 2011, and that the dictator cracked down so hard it caused the violence to spin out of control. We know, of course, that is not the whole story. The US had been involved in fomenting unrest in Syria at least five years or more before violence broke out. A WikiLeaks-released cable from 2006 shows how hard the US Embassy in Damascus was working to figure out a way to overthrow the government. Shortly after the partially manufactured protests devolved into violence, the CIA moved in and began arming (and importing) rebels to finish the deed. In five years the country has been destroyed, hundreds of thousands killed, millions left without homes. 
Likewise, even most critics of the 2003 US attack on Iraq will try to salvage the philosophy of interventionism by claiming the only reason democracy hasn＊t broken out is that the US military didn＊t occupy the country long enough! As if being occupied by a foreign power is the route to responsible governance and the development of civil society! 
There are too many other examples to mention, even little-discussed areas like Somalia and Nigeria 每 with the latter falling prey to a radical Islamist gang, Boko Haram, that benefited from a region awash in weapons after the US-led attack on Libya opened the weapons depots. 
The US was actively involved in breaking up Sudan, which we were told was being run into the ground by ※Arabs§ ruling from the north who were abusing black Africans in the south. I was once invited to lunch by the Sudanese ambassador to Washington while I was working on the Hill and he asked me, ※do I look like an Arab to you?§ Needless to say, I doubt anyone would have guessed he was not what the US government considered a ※black African.§ His point was that the dispute was being created artificially by external sources. In fact the US and its allies were determined to break the country up (hint: it had a lot to do with oil) and would settle for any pretext. The result has not been the peaceful South Sudan ruled locally that was promised. Instead the new country launched with the help of ※humanitarian interventionists§ like US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power has proven to be orders of magnitude worse off than when it was under Khartoum＊s rule. 
The track record of US interventionism is so universally disastrous that slowly but steadily the rest of the world is pushing back against a US foreign policy that is making their own lives less safe. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban, for example, gave an interview to a German newspaper recently in which he singled out US foreign policy as a force for harm rather than good in the world. 
Said Orban: 
America believes in the exportation of democracy. This sounds good; however, wherever it has been tried, entire regions often became destabilized, the consequences of which are suffering, death and migration. Additionally, often anti-democratic, extremist forces rose to power as a result of the free elections. 
Believing in the democracy export is arrogant because it fails to take the cultural structures of the given regions into consideration. But whether you like it or not, it is the culture that determines the political culture. 
That is pretty pointed criticism coming from a close NATO ally and the representative of a pro-US, center-right government. But this week the Hungarians celebrate the 60th anniversary of their 1956 revolution to extricate themselves from under the Soviet boot, so it is understandable that they have the idea of national sovereignty fresh in their minds. 
In a recent episode of Ron Paul＊s Liberty Report, we discussed Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte＊s announcement last week that he wanted to separate his country from domination by US foreign policy. The US has been determined to use the Philippines as a weapon in its arsenal against a China newly assertive in the South China Sea, but many in the Philippines 每 the president included it seems 每 see little benefit to going on war footing against a neighbor with your ally thousands of miles away. 
What can the interventionists offer when the fruits of their philosophy are laid bare? Lies and obfuscation. Manipulation of media messages. Demonization of those who oppose the neoconservatives and ※humanitarian§ interventionists who run Washington＊s foreign policy. But as Dr. Paul has said with increasing frequency lately, their failure is our big opportunity. We must educate ourselves on their failures and we must train ourselves to make the case for a pure noninterventionist foreign policy as the only way to keep us safe.

United States determination to keep its South China Sea territorial disputes with China going rests heavily on having nations with active claims in the sea as US client states, particularly those with claims that conflict with China＊s. That used to be, with several nations having such claims. 
But the US is struggling to keep those nations exclusively buying US arms. Today＊s big loss was from Malaysia , which has announced they intend to buy littoral mission ships from China, instead of the United States. Details on the decision-making process are unclear, but the US problems with their own littoral combat ships breaking down, so that might＊ve hurt their chances. 
It＊s a comparatively small deal, but part of a growing trend. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has been making headlines for weeks with his interest in ending long-standing reliance on the US. While this has grown into complaints about general US-Philippines relations, one of the early grievances was his not liking the US dictating arms sales, and expressing interest in buying from China and Russia instead. 
If these countries start buying their arms from China, they＊ll have a strong incentive to resolve maritime disputes with China diplomatically, which could severely limit their interest in having warships patrolling through the area to ※confront§ China.

※The core ideological content of the holiday serves to validate all that has since occurred on these shores 每 a national consecration of the unspeakable, a balm and benediction for the victors, a blessing of the fruits of murder and kidnapping, and an implicit obligation to continue the seamless historical project in the present day.§ No More American Thanksgivings by Glen Ford 
This article originally appeared in the November 27, 2003 , issue of The Black Commentator, which Glen Ford co-founded and edited. 
Nobody but Americans celebrates Thanksgiving. It is reserved by history and the intent of ※the founders§ as the supremely white American holiday, the most ghoulish event on the national calendar. No Halloween of the imagination can rival the exterminationist reality that was the genesis, and remains the legacy, of the American Thanksgiving. It is the most loathsome, humanity-insulting day of the year 每 a pure glorification of racist barbarity. 
We at are thankful that the day grows nearer when the almost four centuries-old abomination will be deprived of its reason for being: white supremacy. Then we may all eat and drink in peace and gratitude for the blessings of humanity＊s deliverance from the rule of evil men. 
Thanksgiving is much more than a lie 每 if it were that simple, an historical correction of the record of events in 1600s Massachusetts would suffice to purge the ※flaw§ in the national mythology. But Thanksgiving is not just a twisted fable, and the mythology it nurtures is itself inherently evil. The real-life events 每 subsequently revised 每 were perfectly understood at the time as the first, definitive triumphs of the genocidal European project in New England. The near-erasure of Native Americans in Massachusetts and, soon thereafter, from most of the remainder of the northern English colonial seaboard was the true mission of the Pilgrim enterprise 每 Act One of the American Dream. African Slavery commenced contemporaneously 每 an overlapping and ultimately inseparable Act Two. 
The last Act in the American drama must be the ※root and branch§ eradication of all vestiges of Act One and Two 每 America＊s seminal crimes and formative projects. Thanksgiving as presently celebrated 每 that is, as a national political event 每 is an affront to civilization. 
Celebrating the unspeakable 
White America embraced Thanksgiving because a majority of that population glories in the fruits, if not the unpleasant details, of genocide and slavery and feels, on the whole, good about their heritage: a cornucopia of privilege and national power. Children are taught to identify with the good fortune of the Pilgrims. It does not much matter that the Native American and African holocausts that flowed from the feast at Plymouth are hidden from the children＊s version of the story 每 kids learn soon enough that Indians were made scarce and Africans became enslaved. But they will also never forget the core message of the holiday: that the Pilgrims were good people, who could not have purposely set such evil in motion. Just as the first Thanksgivings marked the consolidation of the English toehold in what became the United States, the core ideological content of the holiday serves to validate all that has since occurred on these shores 每 a national consecration of the unspeakable, a balm and benediction for the victors, a blessing of the fruits of murder and kidnapping, and an implicit obligation to continue the seamless historical project in the present day. 
The Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims 每 of harsh weather and their own na?ve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings 每 at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims＊ political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission. 
Thanksgiving is quite dangerous 每 as were the Pilgrims. 
Rejoicing in a cemetery 
The English settlers, their ostensibly religious venture backed by a trading company, were glad to discover that they had landed in a virtual cemetery in 1620. Corn still sprouted in the abandoned fields of the Wampanoags , but only a remnant of the local population remained around the fabled Rock. In a letter to England, Massachusetts Bay colony founder John Winthrop wrote, ""But for the natives in these parts, God hath so pursued them, as for 300 miles space the greatest part of them are swept away by smallpox which still continues among them. So as God hath thereby cleared our title to this place, those who remain in these parts, being in all not 50, have put themselves under our protection."" 
Ever diligent to claim their own advantages as God＊s will, the Pilgrims thanked their deity for having ※pursued§ the Indians to mass death. However, it was not divine intervention that wiped out most of the natives around the village of Patuxet but, most likely, smallpox-embedded blankets planted during an English visit or slave raid. Six years before the Pilgrim landing, a ship sailed into Patuxet＊s harbor, captained by none other than the famous seaman and mercenary soldier John Smith , former leader of the first successful English colony in the New World, at Jamestown, Virginia. Epidemic and slavery followed in his wake, as Debra Glidden described in IMDiversity.com : 
In 1614 the Plymouth Company of England, a joint stock company, hired Captain John Smith to explore land in its behalf. Along what is now the coast of Massachusetts in the territory of the Wampanoag, Smith visited the town of Patuxet according to ""The Colonial Horizon,"" a 1969 book edited by William Goetzinan. Smith renamed the town Plymouth in honor of his employers, but the Wampanoag who inhabited the town continued to call it Patuxet. 
The following year Captain Hunt, an English slave trader, arrived at Patuxet. It was common practice for explorers to capture Indians, take them to Europe and sell them into slavery for 220 shillings apiece. That practice was described in a 1622 account of happenings entitled ""A Declaration of the State of the Colony and Affairs in Virginia,"" written by Edward Waterhouse. True to the explorer tradition, Hunt kidnapped a number of Wampanoags to sell into slavery. 
Another common practice among European explorers was to give ""smallpox blankets"" to the Indians. Since smallpox was unknown on this continent prior to the arrival of the Europeans, Native Americans did not have any natural immunity to the disease so smallpox would effectively wipe out entire villages with very little effort required by the Europeans. William Fenton describes how Europeans decimated Native American villages in his 1957 work ""American Indian and White relations to 1830."" From 1615 to 1619 smallpox ran rampant among the Wampanoags and their neighbors to the north. The Wampanoag lost 70 percent of their population to the epidemic and the Massachusetts lost 90 percent. 
Most of the Wampanoag had died from the smallpox epidemic so when the Pilgrims arrived they found well-cleared fields which they claimed for their own. A Puritan colonist, quoted by Harvard University's Perry Miller, praised the plague that had wiped out the Indians for it was ""the wonderful preparation of the Lord Jesus Christ, by his providence for his people's abode in the Western world."" 
Historians have since speculated endlessly on why the woods in the region resembled a park to the disembarking Pilgrims in 1620. The reason should have been obvious: hundreds, if not thousands, of people had lived there just five years before. 
In less than three generations the settlers would turn all of New England into a charnel house for Native Americans, and fire the economic engines of slavery throughout English-speaking America. Plymouth Rock is the place where the nightmare truly began. 
The uninvited? 
It is not at all clear what happened at the first 每 and only 每 ※integrated§ Thanksgiving feast. Only two written accounts of the three-day event exist, and one of them, by Governor William Bradford, was written 20 years after the fact. Was Chief Massasoit invited to bring 90 Indians with him to dine with 52 colonists, most of them women and children? This seems unlikely. A good harvest had provided the settlers with plenty of food, according to their accounts, so the whites didn＊t really need the Wampanoag＊s offering of five deer. What we do know is that there had been lots of tension between the two groups that fall. John Two-Hawks, who runs the Native Circle web site, gives a sketch of the facts: 
※Thanksgiving' did not begin as a great loving relationship between the pilgrims and the Wampanoag, Pequot and Narragansett people. In fact, in October of 1621 when the pilgrim survivors of their first winter in Turtle Island sat down to share the first unofficial 'Thanksgiving' meal, the Indians who were there were not even invited! There was no turkey, squash, cranberry sauce or pumpkin pie. A few days before this alleged feast took place, a company of 'pilgrims' led by Miles Standish actively sought the head of a local Indian chief, and an 11 foot high wall was erected around the entire Plymouth settlement for the very purpose of keeping Indians out!§ 
It is much more likely that Chief Massasoit either crashed the party, or brought enough men to ensure that he was not kidnapped or harmed by the Pilgrims. Dr. Tingba Apidta, in his ※ Black Folks＊ Guide to Understanding Thanksgiving ,§ surmises that the settlers ※brandished their weaponry§ early and got drunk soon thereafter. He notes that ※each Pilgrim drank at least a half gallon of beer a day, which they preferred even to water. This daily inebriation led their governor, William Bradford, to comment on his people's ＆notorious sin,＊ which included their ＆drunkenness and uncleanliness＊ and rampant ＆sodomy.＊§ 
Soon after the feast the brutish Miles Standish ※got his bloody prize,§ Dr. Apidta writes: 
※He went to the Indians, pretended to be a trader, then beheaded an Indian man named Wituwamat. He brought the head to Plymouth, where it was displayed on a wooden spike for many years, according to Gary B. Nash, ＆as a symbol of white power.＊ Standish had the Indian man's young brother hanged from the rafters for good measure. From that time on, the whites were known to the Indians of Massachusetts by the name ＆Wotowquenange,＊ which in their tongue meant cutthroats and stabbers.§ 
What is certain is that the first feast was not called a ※Thanksgiving§ at the time; no further integrated dining occasions were scheduled; and the first, official all-Pilgrim ※Thanksgiving§ had to wait until 1637, when the whites of New England celebrated the massacre of the Wampanoag＊s southern neighbors, the Pequots. 
The real Thanksgiving Day Massacre 
The Pequots today own the Foxwood Casino and Hotel , in Ledyard, Connecticut, with gross gaming revenues of over $9 billion in 2000. This is truly a (very belated) miracle, since the real first Pilgrim Thanksgiving was intended as the Pequot＊s epitaph. Sixteen years after the problematical Plymouth feast, the English tried mightily to erase the Pequots from the face of the Earth, and thanked God for the blessing. 
Having subdued, intimidated or made mercenaries of most of the tribes of Massachusetts, the English turned their growing force southward, toward the rich Connecticut valley, the Pequot＊s sphere of influence. At the point where the Mystic River meets the sea, the combined force of English and allied Indians bypassed the Pequot fort to attack and set ablaze a town full of women, children and old people. 
William Bradford, the former Governor of Plymouth and one of the chroniclers of the 1621 feast, was also on hand for the great massacre of 1637: 
""Those that escaped the fire were slain with the sword; some hewed to pieces, others run through with their rapiers, so that they were quickly dispatched and very few escaped. It was conceived they thus destroyed about 400 at this time. It was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the fire...horrible was the stink and scent thereof, but the victory seemed a sweet sacrifice, and they gave the prayers thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to enclose their enemies in their hands, and give them so speedy a victory over so proud and insulting an enemy."" 
The rest of the white folks thought so, too. ※This day forth shall be a day of celebration and thanksgiving for subduing the Pequots,"" read Governor John Winthrop＊s proclamation. The authentic Thanksgiving Day was born. 
Most historians believe about 700 Pequots were slaughtered at Mystic. Many prisoners were executed, and surviving women and children sold into slavery in the West Indies. Pequot prisoners that escaped execution were parceled out to Indian tribes allied with the English. The Pequot were thought to have been extinguished as a people. According to IndyMedia , ※The Pequot tribe numbered 8,000 when the Pilgrims arrived, but disease had brought their numbers down to 1,500 by 1637. The Pequot ＆War＊ killed all but a handful of remaining members of the tribe.§ 
But there were still too many Indians around to suit the whites of New England, who bided their time while their own numbers increased to critical, murderous mass. 
Guest＊s head on a pole 
By the 1670s the colonists, with 8,000 men under arms, felt strong enough to demand that the Pilgrims＊ former dinner guests the Wampanoags disarm and submit to the authority of the Crown. After a series of settler provocations in 1675, the Wampanoag struck back, under the leadership of Chief Metacomet, son of Massasoit, called King Philip by the English. Metacomet/Philip, whose wife and son were captured and sold into West Indian slavery, wiped out 13 settlements and killed 600 adult white men before the tide of battle turned. A 1996 issue of the Revolutionary Worker provides an excellent narrative. 
In their victory, the settlers launched an all-out genocide against the remaining Native people. The Massachusetts government offered 20 shillings bounty for every Indian scalp, and 40 shillings for every prisoner who could be sold into slavery. Soldiers were allowed to enslave any Indian woman or child under 14 they could capture. The ""Praying Indians"" who had converted to Christianity and fought on the side of the European troops were accused of shooting into the treetops during battles with ""hostiles."" They were enslaved or killed. Other ""peaceful"" Indians of Dartmouth and Dover were invited to negotiate or seek refuge at trading posts 每 and were sold onto slave ships. 
It is not known how many Indians were sold into slavery, but in this campaign, 500 enslaved Indians were shipped from Plymouth alone. Of the 12,000 Indians in the surrounding tribes, probably about half died from battle, massacre and starvation. 
After King Philip's War, there were almost no Indians left free in the northern British colonies. A colonist wrote from Manhattan's New York colony: ""There is now but few Indians upon the island and those few no ways hurtful. It is to be admired how strangely they have decreased by the hand of God, since the English first settled in these parts."" In Massachusetts, the colonists declared a ""day of public thanksgiving"" in 1676, saying, ""there now scarce remains a name or family of them [the Indians] but are either slain, captivated or fled."" 
Fifty-five years after the original Thanksgiving Day, the Puritans had destroyed the generous Wampanoag and all other neighboring tribes. The Wampanoag chief King Philip was beheaded. His head was stuck on a pole in Plymouth, where the skull still hung on display 24 years later. 
This is not thought to be a fit Thanksgiving tale for the children of today, but it＊s the real story, well-known to the settler children of New England at the time 每 the white kids who saw the Wampanoag head on the pole year after year and knew for certain that God loved them best of all, and that every atrocity they might ever commit against a heathen, non-white was blessed. 
There＊s a good term for the process thus set in motion: nation-building. 
Roots of the slave trade 
The British North American colonists＊ practice of enslaving Indians for labor or direct sale to the West Indies preceded the appearance of the first chained Africans at the dock in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619. The Jamestown colonists＊ human transaction with the Dutch vessel was an unscheduled occurrence. However, once the African slave trade became commercially established, the fates of Indians and Africans in the colonies became inextricably entwined. New England, born of up-close-and-personal, burn-them-in-the-fires-of-hell genocide, led the political and commercial development of the English colonies. The region also led the nascent nation＊s descent into a slavery-based society and economy. 
Ironically, an apologist for Virginian slavery made one of the best, early cases for the indictment of New England as the engine of the American slave trade. Unreconstructed secessionist Lewis Dabney＊s 1867 book ※ A Defense of Virginia § traced the slave trade＊s origins all the way back to Plymouth Rock: 
The planting of the commercial States of North America began with the colony of Puritan Independents at Plymouth, in 1620, which was subsequently enlarged into the State of Massachusetts. The other trading colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut, as well as New Hampshire (which never had an extensive shipping interest), were offshoots of Massachusetts. They partook of the same characteristics and pursuits; and hence, the example of the parent colony is taken here as a fair representation of them. 
The first ship from America, which embarked in the African slave trade, was the Desire , Captain Pierce, of Salem; and this was among the first vessels ever built in the colony. The promptitude with which the ""Puritan Fathers"" embarked in this business may be comprehended, when it is stated that the Desire sailed upon her voyage in June, 1637. [Note: the year they massacred the Pequots.] The first feeble and dubious foothold was gained by the white man at Plymouth less than seventeen years before; and as is well known, many years were expended by the struggle of the handful of settlers for existence. So that it may be correctly said, that the commerce of New England was born of the slave trade; as its subsequent prosperity was largely founded upon it. The Desire , proceeding to the Bahamas, with a cargo of ""dry fish and strong liquors, the only commodities for those parts,"" obtained the negroes from two British men-of-war, which had captured them from a Spanish slaver. 
Thus, the trade of which the good ship Desire , of Salem, was the harbinger, grew into grand proportions; and for nearly two centuries poured a flood of wealth into New England, as well as no inconsiderable number of slaves. Meanwhile, the other maritime colonies of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and Connecticut, followed the example of their elder sister emulously; and their commercial history is but a repetition of that of Massachusetts. The towns of Providence, Newport, and New Haven became famous slave trading ports. The magnificent harbor of the second, especially, was the favorite starting-place of the slave ships; and its commerce rivaled, or even exceeded, that of the present commercial metropolis, New York. All the four original States, of course, became slaveholding. 
The Revolution that exploded in 1770s New England was undertaken by men thoroughly imbued with the worldview of the Indian-killer and slave-holder. How could they not be? The ※country§ they claimed as their own was fathered by genocide and mothered by slavery 每 its true distinction among the commercial nations of the world. And these men were not ashamed, but proud, with vast ambition to spread their exceptional characteristics West and South and wherever their so-far successful project in nation-building might take them 每 and by the same bloody, savage methods that had served them so well in the past. 
At the moment of deepest national crisis following the battle of Gettysburg in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln invoked the national fable that is far more central to the white American personality than Lincoln＊s battlefield ※Address.§ Lincoln seized upon the 1621 feast as the historic ※Thanksgiving§ 每 bypassing the official and authentic 1637 precedent 每 and assigned the dateless, murky event the fourth Thursday in November. 
Lincoln surveyed a broken nation, and attempted nation-rebuilding, based on the purest white myth. The same year that he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, he renewed the national commitment to a white manifest destiny that began at Plymouth Rock. Lincoln sought to rekindle a shared national mission that former Confederates and Unionists and white immigrants from Europe could collectively embrace. It was and remains a barbaric and racist national unifier, by definition. Only the most fantastic lies can sanitize the history of the Plymouth Colony of Massachusetts. 
§Like a rock§ 
The Thanksgiving holiday fable is at once a window on the way that many, if not most, white Americans view the world and their place in it, and a pollutant that leaches barbarism into the modern era. The fable attempts to glorify the indefensible, to enshrine an era and mission that represent the nation＊s lowest moral denominators . Thanksgiving as framed in the mythology is, consequently, a drag on that which is potentially civilizing in the national character, a crippling, atavistic deformity. Defenders of the holiday will claim that the politically-corrected children＊s version promotes brotherhood, but that is an impossibility 每 a bald excuse to prolong the worship of colonial ※forefathers§ and to erase the crimes they committed. Those bastards burned the Pequot women and children, and ushered in the multinational business of slavery. These are facts. The myth is an insidious diversion 每 and worse. 
Humanity cannot tolerate a 21st Century superpower, much of whose population perceives the world through the eyes of 17th Century land and flesh bandits. Yet that is the trick that fate has played on the globe. We described the roots of the planetary dilemma in our March 13 commentary, ※ Racism & War, Perfect Together. § 
The English arrived with criminal intent - and brought wives and children to form new societies predicated on successful plunder. To justify the murderous enterprise, Indians who had initially cooperated with the squatters were transmogrified into ""savages"" deserving displacement and death. The relentlessly refreshed lie of Indian savagery became a truth in the minds of white Americans, a fact to be acted upon by every succeeding generation of whites. The settlers became a singular people confronting the great ""frontier"" - a euphemism for centuries of genocidal campaigns against a darker, ""savage"" people marked for extinction. 
The necessity of genocide was the operative, working assumption of the expanding American nation. ""Manifest Destiny"" was born at Plymouth Rock and Jamestown, later to fall (to paraphrase Malcolm) like a rock on Mexico, the Philippines, Haiti, Nicaragua, etc. Little children were taught that the American project was inherently good, Godly, and that those who got in the way were ""evil-doers"" or just plain subhuman, to be gloriously eliminated. The lie is central to white American identity, embraced by waves of European settlers who never saw a red person. 
Only a century ago, American soldiers caused the deaths of possibly a million Filipinos whom they had been sent to ※liberate§ from Spanish rule. They didn＊t even know who they were killing, and so rationalized their behavior by substituting the usual American victims. Colonel Funston , of the Twentieth Kansas Volunteers, explained what got him motivated in the Philippines: 
""Our fighting blood was up and we all wanted to kill 'niggers.' This shooting human beings is a 'hot game,' and beats rabbit hunting all to pieces."" Another wrote that ""the boys go for the enemy as if they were chasing jack-rabbits .... I, for one, hope that Uncle Sam will apply the chastening rod, good, hard, and plenty, and lay it on until they come into the reservation and promise to be good 'Injuns.'"" 
Last week in northern Iraq another American colonel, Joe Anderson of the 101st Airborne (Assault) Division, revealed that he is incapable of perceiving Arabs as human beings. Colonel Anderson, who doubles as a commander and host of a radio call-in program and a TV show designed to win the hearts and minds of the people of Mosul, had learned that someone was out to assassinate him. In the wild mood swing common to racists, Anderson decided that Iraqis are all alike 每 and of a different breed. He said as much to the Los Angeles Times . 
""They don't understand being nice,"" said Anderson, who helps oversee the military zone that includes Mosul and environs. He doesn't hide his irritation after months dedicated to restoring the city: ""We spent so long here working with kid gloves, but the average Iraqi guy will tell you, 'The only thing people respect here is violence＃. They only understand being shot at, being killed. That's the culture.' ＃ Nice guys do finish last here."" 
Col. Anderson personifies the unfitness of Americans to play a major role in the world, much less rule it. ""We poured a lot of our heart and soul into trying to help the people,§ he bitched, as if Americans were God＊s gift to the planet. ""But it can be frustrating when you hear stupid people still saying, 'You're occupiers. You want our oil. You're turning our country over to Israel.'§ He cannot fathom that other people 每 non-whites 每 aspire to run their own affairs, and will kill and die to achieve that basic right. 
What does this have to do with the Mayflower? Everything. Although possibly against their wishes, the Pilgrims hosted the Wampanoag for three no doubt anxious days. The same men killed and enslaved Wampanoags immediately before and after the feast. They, their newly arrived English comrades and their children roasted hundreds of neighboring Indians alive just 16 years later, and two generations afterwards cleared nearly the whole of New England of its indigenous ※savages,§ while enthusiastically enriching themselves through the invention of transoceanic, sophisticated means of enslaving millions. The Mayflower＊s cultural heirs are programmed to find glory in their own depravity, and savagery in their most helpless victims, who can only redeem themselves by accepting the inherent goodness of white Americans. 
Thanksgiving encourages these cognitive cripples in their madness, just as it is designed to do.",english,2016-11-23T10:10:50.825+02:00,blackagendareport.com,EU,,No More American Thanksgivings,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Donald Trump is mostly bad news for Africa, including reduced U.S. aid and possibly more support for ※imperial African adventurism"" 每 unless, of course, Africa uses Trump＊s lemons to make lemonade. His isolationism ※could give Africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops.§ On climate policy, Trump is an unmitigated disaster. What Does a Trump Victory Mean for Africa? by Patrick Bond 
This article previously appeared in Pambazuka News . 
※ Trump will sabotage the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and similar strategies to solve global problems.§ 
The most catastrophic long-term consequence is climate change. This is because Trump is a denialist who will give the green light to widespread fracking, coal and oil exploration. Africa will be the most adversely affected continent. United Nations scientists estimate that 9 out of 10 small-scale farmers are unlikely to farm by 2100 due to drying soils and global warming, plus extreme weather will also cause 180 million unnecessary African deaths by then, according to Christian Aid. 
Under Trump, we can safely predict that Washington will no longer seek to control United Nations climate negotiations, as did Barack Obama＊s administration. The WikiLeaks Clinton emails and State Department cables revealed blatant manipulations of the Copenhagen and Durban climate summits. Instead, Trump will simply pull the US out of the 2015 Paris agreement, as did George W. Bush from the Kyoto Protocol. 
By good fortune, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change annual summit is underway this week in Morocco. The only logical move, if the delegates have any spine, is to expel the US State Department and establish the machinery for a major carbon tax applied to products associated with countries 每 the US especially 每 which raise emissions and threaten the survival of many species across the globe. 
※Trump will simply pull the US out of the 2015 Paris agreement, as did George W. Bush from the Kyoto Protocol.§ 
Trump also heralds a rise in US racism and xenophobia, parallel to the Brexit vote by the British white working class. In neither case will local solutions be effective for the simple reason that neither Trump nor Theresa May (UK Prime Minister) are interested in the income redistribution required to benefit their economies. 
And African elites who have 每 with a few exceptions 每 climbed over each other to please Washington, won＊t find themselves welcome in the White House. 
Hopefully the contagion of Trump＊s racism 每 which will make life for Africans much harder 每 will be met by a major resistance movement including Africans from all walks of life in solidarity with various groups that stand to be oppressed by the US 每 women, African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims, environmentalists, progressives of all sorts. This movement can shape up in the same spirit to those that gave solidarity during the fight against apartheid. 
What are the likely economic consequences? 
Consistent with his isolationism, world trade stagnation will continue. In the case of Africa, Trump is likely to retract benefits under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act and reduce US aid. 
That isolationism, in turn, could give Africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops. Africa must focus on localizing its economies to be able to meet basic needs. 
Trump＊s hatred of what he terms the ※globalists§ is probably just hot electioneering rhetoric. It＊s fair to predict that pro-corporate candidates will come forward as Trump allies to calm the crashing stock markets. 
The ※neoliberal§ group of policy wonks who expressed disgust with Trump and favored Hillary Clinton will quickly make inroads into the new administration. They will ensure that the continuing US dominance in Western-leaning multilateral institutions is not disturbed. 
We can simply anticipate more brazen US self-interest, as witnessed during the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush regimes, with less of the confusing rhetoric promoted by Obama and his allies. 
What US policies on Africa are likely to change? With what impact? 
To be frank, we can only offer guesses. Trump said literally nothing about Africa during his campaign. He wants to ※rebuild US military power,§ which might include strengthening the Pentagon＊s controversial Africa Command, known as Africom. 
Economically, it is worth noting Trump＊s close relations to the oil and gas industry which comes via Vice President Mike Pence. This suggests that multinational corporations in the extractive industries who desire more explicit imperial support for African adventurism will be served well by Trump＊s bully-boy mentality. 
What does this mean for multilateral institutions and how will this affect Africa? 
The US＊s role in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will become nastier given the veto power it enjoys, holding more than 15% of the voting shares. Trump will probably hire a brutal neoliberal as his IMF executive director, someone who will tighten the screws on Africa using Washington＊s veto power. The leaders of two big African economies are desperate for IMF credits: Nigeria ($29 billion) and Egypt ($12 billion). 
In relation to the United Nations, an interesting question comes to mind: should the UN leadership now sitting in Trump＊s Manhattan East Side neighborhood not develop a contingency plan to move UN headquarters out of the US? Trump promises to make life very hard for visitors who are Muslims, Libyans, Syrians and Mexicans 每 amongst others 每 so holding multilateral events in the US may soon be impossible. 
The period ahead demands a very different multilateralism due to a number of expectations. The first is that Trump will sabotage the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and similar strategies to solve global problems, and wreck nuclear non-proliferation strategies such as the agreement that Obama painstakingly reached with Iran earlier this year. 
And the second is that three of the BRICS＊ nationalistic leaders 每 Vladimir Putin in Russia, Nahendra Modi in India and Michel Temer in Brazil 每 can be expected to establish much closer ties to Trump. This is likely to affect the balance of power between geographical regions, added to which are the drift of Pakistan, Turkey and the Philippines away from Washington. Trump＊s hatred of China is another indeterminate factor. 
Regardless of the geopolitical maneuvers, it＊s time for a ＆multilateralism-from-below＊ in which traditional progressive movements in civil society find common cause, because this is the most serious threat to humanity, the world economy and environment we＊ve seen in living memory.

※The core ideological content of the holiday serves to validate all that has since occurred on these shores 每 a national consecration of the unspeakable, a balm and benediction for the victors, a blessing of the fruits of murder and kidnapping, and an implicit obligation to continue the seamless historical project in the present day.§ No More American Thanksgivings by Glen Ford 
This article originally appeared in the November 27, 2003 , issue of The Black Commentator, which Glen Ford co-founded and edited. 
Nobody but Americans celebrates Thanksgiving. It is reserved by history and the intent of ※the founders§ as the supremely white American holiday, the most ghoulish event on the national calendar. No Halloween of the imagination can rival the exterminationist reality that was the genesis, and remains the legacy, of the American Thanksgiving. It is the most loathsome, humanity-insulting day of the year 每 a pure glorification of racist barbarity. 
We at are thankful that the day grows nearer when the almost four centuries-old abomination will be deprived of its reason for being: white supremacy. Then we may all eat and drink in peace and gratitude for the blessings of humanity＊s deliverance from the rule of evil men. 
Thanksgiving is much more than a lie 每 if it were that simple, an historical correction of the record of events in 1600s Massachusetts would suffice to purge the ※flaw§ in the national mythology. But Thanksgiving is not just a twisted fable, and the mythology it nurtures is itself inherently evil. The real-life events 每 subsequently revised 每 were perfectly understood at the time as the first, definitive triumphs of the genocidal European project in New England. The near-erasure of Native Americans in Massachusetts and, soon thereafter, from most of the remainder of the northern English colonial seaboard was the true mission of the Pilgrim enterprise 每 Act One of the American Dream. African Slavery commenced contemporaneously 每 an overlapping and ultimately inseparable Act Two. 
The last Act in the American drama must be the ※root and branch§ eradication of all vestiges of Act One and Two 每 America＊s seminal crimes and formative projects. Thanksgiving as presently celebrated 每 that is, as a national political event 每 is an affront to civilization. 
Celebrating the unspeakable 
White America embraced Thanksgiving because a majority of that population glories in the fruits, if not the unpleasant details, of genocide and slavery and feels, on the whole, good about their heritage: a cornucopia of privilege and national power. Children are taught to identify with the good fortune of the Pilgrims. It does not much matter that the Native American and African holocausts that flowed from the feast at Plymouth are hidden from the children＊s version of the story 每 kids learn soon enough that Indians were made scarce and Africans became enslaved. But they will also never forget the core message of the holiday: that the Pilgrims were good people, who could not have purposely set such evil in motion. Just as the first Thanksgivings marked the consolidation of the English toehold in what became the United States, the core ideological content of the holiday serves to validate all that has since occurred on these shores 每 a national consecration of the unspeakable, a balm and benediction for the victors, a blessing of the fruits of murder and kidnapping, and an implicit obligation to continue the seamless historical project in the present day. 
The Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims 每 of harsh weather and their own na?ve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings 每 at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims＊ political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission. 
Thanksgiving is quite dangerous 每 as were the Pilgrims. 
Rejoicing in a cemetery 
The English settlers, their ostensibly religious venture backed by a trading company, were glad to discover that they had landed in a virtual cemetery in 1620. Corn still sprouted in the abandoned fields of the Wampanoags , but only a remnant of the local population remained around the fabled Rock. In a letter to England, Massachusetts Bay colony founder John Winthrop wrote, ""But for the natives in these parts, God hath so pursued them, as for 300 miles space the greatest part of them are swept away by smallpox which still continues among them. So as God hath thereby cleared our title to this place, those who remain in these parts, being in all not 50, have put themselves under our protection."" 
Ever diligent to claim their own advantages as God＊s will, the Pilgrims thanked their deity for having ※pursued§ the Indians to mass death. However, it was not divine intervention that wiped out most of the natives around the village of Patuxet but, most likely, smallpox-embedded blankets planted during an English visit or slave raid. Six years before the Pilgrim landing, a ship sailed into Patuxet＊s harbor, captained by none other than the famous seaman and mercenary soldier John Smith , former leader of the first successful English colony in the New World, at Jamestown, Virginia. Epidemic and slavery followed in his wake, as Debra Glidden described in IMDiversity.com : 
In 1614 the Plymouth Company of England, a joint stock company, hired Captain John Smith to explore land in its behalf. Along what is now the coast of Massachusetts in the territory of the Wampanoag, Smith visited the town of Patuxet according to ""The Colonial Horizon,"" a 1969 book edited by William Goetzinan. Smith renamed the town Plymouth in honor of his employers, but the Wampanoag who inhabited the town continued to call it Patuxet. 
The following year Captain Hunt, an English slave trader, arrived at Patuxet. It was common practice for explorers to capture Indians, take them to Europe and sell them into slavery for 220 shillings apiece. That practice was described in a 1622 account of happenings entitled ""A Declaration of the State of the Colony and Affairs in Virginia,"" written by Edward Waterhouse. True to the explorer tradition, Hunt kidnapped a number of Wampanoags to sell into slavery. 
Another common practice among European explorers was to give ""smallpox blankets"" to the Indians. Since smallpox was unknown on this continent prior to the arrival of the Europeans, Native Americans did not have any natural immunity to the disease so smallpox would effectively wipe out entire villages with very little effort required by the Europeans. William Fenton describes how Europeans decimated Native American villages in his 1957 work ""American Indian and White relations to 1830."" From 1615 to 1619 smallpox ran rampant among the Wampanoags and their neighbors to the north. The Wampanoag lost 70 percent of their population to the epidemic and the Massachusetts lost 90 percent. 
Most of the Wampanoag had died from the smallpox epidemic so when the Pilgrims arrived they found well-cleared fields which they claimed for their own. A Puritan colonist, quoted by Harvard University's Perry Miller, praised the plague that had wiped out the Indians for it was ""the wonderful preparation of the Lord Jesus Christ, by his providence for his people's abode in the Western world."" 
Historians have since speculated endlessly on why the woods in the region resembled a park to the disembarking Pilgrims in 1620. The reason should have been obvious: hundreds, if not thousands, of people had lived there just five years before. 
In less than three generations the settlers would turn all of New England into a charnel house for Native Americans, and fire the economic engines of slavery throughout English-speaking America. Plymouth Rock is the place where the nightmare truly began. 
The uninvited? 
It is not at all clear what happened at the first 每 and only 每 ※integrated§ Thanksgiving feast. Only two written accounts of the three-day event exist, and one of them, by Governor William Bradford, was written 20 years after the fact. Was Chief Massasoit invited to bring 90 Indians with him to dine with 52 colonists, most of them women and children? This seems unlikely. A good harvest had provided the settlers with plenty of food, according to their accounts, so the whites didn＊t really need the Wampanoag＊s offering of five deer. What we do know is that there had been lots of tension between the two groups that fall. John Two-Hawks, who runs the Native Circle web site, gives a sketch of the facts: 
※Thanksgiving' did not begin as a great loving relationship between the pilgrims and the Wampanoag, Pequot and Narragansett people. In fact, in October of 1621 when the pilgrim survivors of their first winter in Turtle Island sat down to share the first unofficial 'Thanksgiving' meal, the Indians who were there were not even invited! There was no turkey, squash, cranberry sauce or pumpkin pie. A few days before this alleged feast took place, a company of 'pilgrims' led by Miles Standish actively sought the head of a local Indian chief, and an 11 foot high wall was erected around the entire Plymouth settlement for the very purpose of keeping Indians out!§ 
It is much more likely that Chief Massasoit either crashed the party, or brought enough men to ensure that he was not kidnapped or harmed by the Pilgrims. Dr. Tingba Apidta, in his ※ Black Folks＊ Guide to Understanding Thanksgiving ,§ surmises that the settlers ※brandished their weaponry§ early and got drunk soon thereafter. He notes that ※each Pilgrim drank at least a half gallon of beer a day, which they preferred even to water. This daily inebriation led their governor, William Bradford, to comment on his people's ＆notorious sin,＊ which included their ＆drunkenness and uncleanliness＊ and rampant ＆sodomy.＊§ 
Soon after the feast the brutish Miles Standish ※got his bloody prize,§ Dr. Apidta writes: 
※He went to the Indians, pretended to be a trader, then beheaded an Indian man named Wituwamat. He brought the head to Plymouth, where it was displayed on a wooden spike for many years, according to Gary B. Nash, ＆as a symbol of white power.＊ Standish had the Indian man's young brother hanged from the rafters for good measure. From that time on, the whites were known to the Indians of Massachusetts by the name ＆Wotowquenange,＊ which in their tongue meant cutthroats and stabbers.§ 
What is certain is that the first feast was not called a ※Thanksgiving§ at the time; no further integrated dining occasions were scheduled; and the first, official all-Pilgrim ※Thanksgiving§ had to wait until 1637, when the whites of New England celebrated the massacre of the Wampanoag＊s southern neighbors, the Pequots. 
The real Thanksgiving Day Massacre 
The Pequots today own the Foxwood Casino and Hotel , in Ledyard, Connecticut, with gross gaming revenues of over $9 billion in 2000. This is truly a (very belated) miracle, since the real first Pilgrim Thanksgiving was intended as the Pequot＊s epitaph. Sixteen years after the problematical Plymouth feast, the English tried mightily to erase the Pequots from the face of the Earth, and thanked God for the blessing. 
Having subdued, intimidated or made mercenaries of most of the tribes of Massachusetts, the English turned their growing force southward, toward the rich Connecticut valley, the Pequot＊s sphere of influence. At the point where the Mystic River meets the sea, the combined force of English and allied Indians bypassed the Pequot fort to attack and set ablaze a town full of women, children and old people. 
William Bradford, the former Governor of Plymouth and one of the chroniclers of the 1621 feast, was also on hand for the great massacre of 1637: 
""Those that escaped the fire were slain with the sword; some hewed to pieces, others run through with their rapiers, so that they were quickly dispatched and very few escaped. It was conceived they thus destroyed about 400 at this time. It was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the fire...horrible was the stink and scent thereof, but the victory seemed a sweet sacrifice, and they gave the prayers thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to enclose their enemies in their hands, and give them so speedy a victory over so proud and insulting an enemy."" 
The rest of the white folks thought so, too. ※This day forth shall be a day of celebration and thanksgiving for subduing the Pequots,"" read Governor John Winthrop＊s proclamation. The authentic Thanksgiving Day was born. 
Most historians believe about 700 Pequots were slaughtered at Mystic. Many prisoners were executed, and surviving women and children sold into slavery in the West Indies. Pequot prisoners that escaped execution were parceled out to Indian tribes allied with the English. The Pequot were thought to have been extinguished as a people. According to IndyMedia , ※The Pequot tribe numbered 8,000 when the Pilgrims arrived, but disease had brought their numbers down to 1,500 by 1637. The Pequot ＆War＊ killed all but a handful of remaining members of the tribe.§ 
But there were still too many Indians around to suit the whites of New England, who bided their time while their own numbers increased to critical, murderous mass. 
Guest＊s head on a pole 
By the 1670s the colonists, with 8,000 men under arms, felt strong enough to demand that the Pilgrims＊ former dinner guests the Wampanoags disarm and submit to the authority of the Crown. After a series of settler provocations in 1675, the Wampanoag struck back, under the leadership of Chief Metacomet, son of Massasoit, called King Philip by the English. Metacomet/Philip, whose wife and son were captured and sold into West Indian slavery, wiped out 13 settlements and killed 600 adult white men before the tide of battle turned. A 1996 issue of the Revolutionary Worker provides an excellent narrative. 
In their victory, the settlers launched an all-out genocide against the remaining Native people. The Massachusetts government offered 20 shillings bounty for every Indian scalp, and 40 shillings for every prisoner who could be sold into slavery. Soldiers were allowed to enslave any Indian woman or child under 14 they could capture. The ""Praying Indians"" who had converted to Christianity and fought on the side of the European troops were accused of shooting into the treetops during battles with ""hostiles."" They were enslaved or killed. Other ""peaceful"" Indians of Dartmouth and Dover were invited to negotiate or seek refuge at trading posts 每 and were sold onto slave ships. 
It is not known how many Indians were sold into slavery, but in this campaign, 500 enslaved Indians were shipped from Plymouth alone. Of the 12,000 Indians in the surrounding tribes, probably about half died from battle, massacre and starvation. 
After King Philip's War, there were almost no Indians left free in the northern British colonies. A colonist wrote from Manhattan's New York colony: ""There is now but few Indians upon the island and those few no ways hurtful. It is to be admired how strangely they have decreased by the hand of God, since the English first settled in these parts."" In Massachusetts, the colonists declared a ""day of public thanksgiving"" in 1676, saying, ""there now scarce remains a name or family of them [the Indians] but are either slain, captivated or fled."" 
Fifty-five years after the original Thanksgiving Day, the Puritans had destroyed the generous Wampanoag and all other neighboring tribes. The Wampanoag chief King Philip was beheaded. His head was stuck on a pole in Plymouth, where the skull still hung on display 24 years later. 
This is not thought to be a fit Thanksgiving tale for the children of today, but it＊s the real story, well-known to the settler children of New England at the time 每 the white kids who saw the Wampanoag head on the pole year after year and knew for certain that God loved them best of all, and that every atrocity they might ever commit against a heathen, non-white was blessed. 
There＊s a good term for the process thus set in motion: nation-building. 
Roots of the slave trade 
The British North American colonists＊ practice of enslaving Indians for labor or direct sale to the West Indies preceded the appearance of the first chained Africans at the dock in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619. The Jamestown colonists＊ human transaction with the Dutch vessel was an unscheduled occurrence. However, once the African slave trade became commercially established, the fates of Indians and Africans in the colonies became inextricably entwined. New England, born of up-close-and-personal, burn-them-in-the-fires-of-hell genocide, led the political and commercial development of the English colonies. The region also led the nascent nation＊s descent into a slavery-based society and economy. 
Ironically, an apologist for Virginian slavery made one of the best, early cases for the indictment of New England as the engine of the American slave trade. Unreconstructed secessionist Lewis Dabney＊s 1867 book ※ A Defense of Virginia § traced the slave trade＊s origins all the way back to Plymouth Rock: 
The planting of the commercial States of North America began with the colony of Puritan Independents at Plymouth, in 1620, which was subsequently enlarged into the State of Massachusetts. The other trading colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut, as well as New Hampshire (which never had an extensive shipping interest), were offshoots of Massachusetts. They partook of the same characteristics and pursuits; and hence, the example of the parent colony is taken here as a fair representation of them. 
The first ship from America, which embarked in the African slave trade, was the Desire , Captain Pierce, of Salem; and this was among the first vessels ever built in the colony. The promptitude with which the ""Puritan Fathers"" embarked in this business may be comprehended, when it is stated that the Desire sailed upon her voyage in June, 1637. [Note: the year they massacred the Pequots.] The first feeble and dubious foothold was gained by the white man at Plymouth less than seventeen years before; and as is well known, many years were expended by the struggle of the handful of settlers for existence. So that it may be correctly said, that the commerce of New England was born of the slave trade; as its subsequent prosperity was largely founded upon it. The Desire , proceeding to the Bahamas, with a cargo of ""dry fish and strong liquors, the only commodities for those parts,"" obtained the negroes from two British men-of-war, which had captured them from a Spanish slaver. 
Thus, the trade of which the good ship Desire , of Salem, was the harbinger, grew into grand proportions; and for nearly two centuries poured a flood of wealth into New England, as well as no inconsiderable number of slaves. Meanwhile, the other maritime colonies of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and Connecticut, followed the example of their elder sister emulously; and their commercial history is but a repetition of that of Massachusetts. The towns of Providence, Newport, and New Haven became famous slave trading ports. The magnificent harbor of the second, especially, was the favorite starting-place of the slave ships; and its commerce rivaled, or even exceeded, that of the present commercial metropolis, New York. All the four original States, of course, became slaveholding. 
The Revolution that exploded in 1770s New England was undertaken by men thoroughly imbued with the worldview of the Indian-killer and slave-holder. How could they not be? The ※country§ they claimed as their own was fathered by genocide and mothered by slavery 每 its true distinction among the commercial nations of the world. And these men were not ashamed, but proud, with vast ambition to spread their exceptional characteristics West and South and wherever their so-far successful project in nation-building might take them 每 and by the same bloody, savage methods that had served them so well in the past. 
At the moment of deepest national crisis following the battle of Gettysburg in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln invoked the national fable that is far more central to the white American personality than Lincoln＊s battlefield ※Address.§ Lincoln seized upon the 1621 feast as the historic ※Thanksgiving§ 每 bypassing the official and authentic 1637 precedent 每 and assigned the dateless, murky event the fourth Thursday in November. 
Lincoln surveyed a broken nation, and attempted nation-rebuilding, based on the purest white myth. The same year that he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, he renewed the national commitment to a white manifest destiny that began at Plymouth Rock. Lincoln sought to rekindle a shared national mission that former Confederates and Unionists and white immigrants from Europe could collectively embrace. It was and remains a barbaric and racist national unifier, by definition. Only the most fantastic lies can sanitize the history of the Plymouth Colony of Massachusetts. 
§Like a rock§ 
The Thanksgiving holiday fable is at once a window on the way that many, if not most, white Americans view the world and their place in it, and a pollutant that leaches barbarism into the modern era. The fable attempts to glorify the indefensible, to enshrine an era and mission that represent the nation＊s lowest moral denominators . Thanksgiving as framed in the mythology is, consequently, a drag on that which is potentially civilizing in the national character, a crippling, atavistic deformity. Defenders of the holiday will claim that the politically-corrected children＊s version promotes brotherhood, but that is an impossibility 每 a bald excuse to prolong the worship of colonial ※forefathers§ and to erase the crimes they committed. Those bastards burned the Pequot women and children, and ushered in the multinational business of slavery. These are facts. The myth is an insidious diversion 每 and worse. 
Humanity cannot tolerate a 21st Century superpower, much of whose population perceives the world through the eyes of 17th Century land and flesh bandits. Yet that is the trick that fate has played on the globe. We described the roots of the planetary dilemma in our March 13 commentary, ※ Racism & War, Perfect Together. § 
The English arrived with criminal intent - and brought wives and children to form new societies predicated on successful plunder. To justify the murderous enterprise, Indians who had initially cooperated with the squatters were transmogrified into ""savages"" deserving displacement and death. The relentlessly refreshed lie of Indian savagery became a truth in the minds of white Americans, a fact to be acted upon by every succeeding generation of whites. The settlers became a singular people confronting the great ""frontier"" - a euphemism for centuries of genocidal campaigns against a darker, ""savage"" people marked for extinction. 
The necessity of genocide was the operative, working assumption of the expanding American nation. ""Manifest Destiny"" was born at Plymouth Rock and Jamestown, later to fall (to paraphrase Malcolm) like a rock on Mexico, the Philippines, Haiti, Nicaragua, etc. Little children were taught that the American project was inherently good, Godly, and that those who got in the way were ""evil-doers"" or just plain subhuman, to be gloriously eliminated. The lie is central to white American identity, embraced by waves of European settlers who never saw a red person. 
Only a century ago, American soldiers caused the deaths of possibly a million Filipinos whom they had been sent to ※liberate§ from Spanish rule. They didn＊t even know who they were killing, and so rationalized their behavior by substituting the usual American victims. Colonel Funston , of the Twentieth Kansas Volunteers, explained what got him motivated in the Philippines: 
""Our fighting blood was up and we all wanted to kill 'niggers.' This shooting human beings is a 'hot game,' and beats rabbit hunting all to pieces."" Another wrote that ""the boys go for the enemy as if they were chasing jack-rabbits .... I, for one, hope that Uncle Sam will apply the chastening rod, good, hard, and plenty, and lay it on until they come into the reservation and promise to be good 'Injuns.'"" 
Last week in northern Iraq another American colonel, Joe Anderson of the 101st Airborne (Assault) Division, revealed that he is incapable of perceiving Arabs as human beings. Colonel Anderson, who doubles as a commander and host of a radio call-in program and a TV show designed to win the hearts and minds of the people of Mosul, had learned that someone was out to assassinate him. In the wild mood swing common to racists, Anderson decided that Iraqis are all alike 每 and of a different breed. He said as much to the Los Angeles Times . 
""They don't understand being nice,"" said Anderson, who helps oversee the military zone that includes Mosul and environs. He doesn't hide his irritation after months dedicated to restoring the city: ""We spent so long here working with kid gloves, but the average Iraqi guy will tell you, 'The only thing people respect here is violence＃. They only understand being shot at, being killed. That's the culture.' ＃ Nice guys do finish last here."" 
Col. Anderson personifies the unfitness of Americans to play a major role in the world, much less rule it. ""We poured a lot of our heart and soul into trying to help the people,§ he bitched, as if Americans were God＊s gift to the planet. ""But it can be frustrating when you hear stupid people still saying, 'You're occupiers. You want our oil. You're turning our country over to Israel.'§ He cannot fathom that other people 每 non-whites 每 aspire to run their own affairs, and will kill and die to achieve that basic right. 
What does this have to do with the Mayflower? Everything. Although possibly against their wishes, the Pilgrims hosted the Wampanoag for three no doubt anxious days. The same men killed and enslaved Wampanoags immediately before and after the feast. They, their newly arrived English comrades and their children roasted hundreds of neighboring Indians alive just 16 years later, and two generations afterwards cleared nearly the whole of New England of its indigenous ※savages,§ while enthusiastically enriching themselves through the invention of transoceanic, sophisticated means of enslaving millions. The Mayflower＊s cultural heirs are programmed to find glory in their own depravity, and savagery in their most helpless victims, who can only redeem themselves by accepting the inherent goodness of white Americans.

Donald Trump is mostly bad news for Africa, including reduced U.S. aid and possibly more support for ※imperial African adventurism"" 每 unless, of course, Africa uses Trump＊s lemons to make lemonade. His isolationism ※could give Africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops.§ On climate policy, Trump is an unmitigated disaster. What Does a Trump Victory Mean for Africa? by Patrick Bond 
This article previously appeared in Pambazuka News . 
※ Trump will sabotage the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and similar strategies to solve global problems.§ 
The most catastrophic long-term consequence is climate change. This is because Trump is a denialist who will give the green light to widespread fracking, coal and oil exploration. Africa will be the most adversely affected continent. United Nations scientists estimate that 9 out of 10 small-scale farmers are unlikely to farm by 2100 due to drying soils and global warming, plus extreme weather will also cause 180 million unnecessary African deaths by then, according to Christian Aid. 
Under Trump, we can safely predict that Washington will no longer seek to control United Nations climate negotiations, as did Barack Obama＊s administration. The WikiLeaks Clinton emails and State Department cables revealed blatant manipulations of the Copenhagen and Durban climate summits. Instead, Trump will simply pull the US out of the 2015 Paris agreement, as did George W. Bush from the Kyoto Protocol. 
By good fortune, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change annual summit is underway this week in Morocco. The only logical move, if the delegates have any spine, is to expel the US State Department and establish the machinery for a major carbon tax applied to products associated with countries 每 the US especially 每 which raise emissions and threaten the survival of many species across the globe. 
※Trump will simply pull the US out of the 2015 Paris agreement, as did George W. Bush from the Kyoto Protocol.§ 
Trump also heralds a rise in US racism and xenophobia, parallel to the Brexit vote by the British white working class. In neither case will local solutions be effective for the simple reason that neither Trump nor Theresa May (UK Prime Minister) are interested in the income redistribution required to benefit their economies. 
And African elites who have 每 with a few exceptions 每 climbed over each other to please Washington, won＊t find themselves welcome in the White House. 
Hopefully the contagion of Trump＊s racism 每 which will make life for Africans much harder 每 will be met by a major resistance movement including Africans from all walks of life in solidarity with various groups that stand to be oppressed by the US 每 women, African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims, environmentalists, progressives of all sorts. This movement can shape up in the same spirit to those that gave solidarity during the fight against apartheid. 
What are the likely economic consequences? 
Consistent with his isolationism, world trade stagnation will continue. In the case of Africa, Trump is likely to retract benefits under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act and reduce US aid. 
That isolationism, in turn, could give Africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops. Africa must focus on localizing its economies to be able to meet basic needs. 
Trump＊s hatred of what he terms the ※globalists§ is probably just hot electioneering rhetoric. It＊s fair to predict that pro-corporate candidates will come forward as Trump allies to calm the crashing stock markets. 
The ※neoliberal§ group of policy wonks who expressed disgust with Trump and favored Hillary Clinton will quickly make inroads into the new administration. They will ensure that the continuing US dominance in Western-leaning multilateral institutions is not disturbed. 
We can simply anticipate more brazen US self-interest, as witnessed during the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush regimes, with less of the confusing rhetoric promoted by Obama and his allies. 
What US policies on Africa are likely to change? With what impact? 
To be frank, we can only offer guesses. Trump said literally nothing about Africa during his campaign. He wants to ※rebuild US military power,§ which might include strengthening the Pentagon＊s controversial Africa Command, known as Africom. 
Economically, it is worth noting Trump＊s close relations to the oil and gas industry which comes via Vice President Mike Pence. This suggests that multinational corporations in the extractive industries who desire more explicit imperial support for African adventurism will be served well by Trump＊s bully-boy mentality. 
What does this mean for multilateral institutions and how will this affect Africa? 
The US＊s role in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will become nastier given the veto power it enjoys, holding more than 15% of the voting shares. Trump will probably hire a brutal neoliberal as his IMF executive director, someone who will tighten the screws on Africa using Washington＊s veto power. The leaders of two big African economies are desperate for IMF credits: Nigeria ($29 billion) and Egypt ($12 billion). 
In relation to the United Nations, an interesting question comes to mind: should the UN leadership now sitting in Trump＊s Manhattan East Side neighborhood not develop a contingency plan to move UN headquarters out of the US? Trump promises to make life very hard for visitors who are Muslims, Libyans, Syrians and Mexicans 每 amongst others 每 so holding multilateral events in the US may soon be impossible. 
The period ahead demands a very different multilateralism due to a number of expectations. The first is that Trump will sabotage the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and similar strategies to solve global problems, and wreck nuclear non-proliferation strategies such as the agreement that Obama painstakingly reached with Iran earlier this year. 
And the second is that three of the BRICS＊ nationalistic leaders 每 Vladimir Putin in Russia, Nahendra Modi in India and Michel Temer in Brazil 每 can be expected to establish much closer ties to Trump. This is likely to affect the balance of power between geographical regions, added to which are the drift of Pakistan, Turkey and the Philippines away from Washington. Trump＊s hatred of China is another indeterminate factor. 
Regardless of the geopolitical maneuvers, it＊s time for a ＆multilateralism-from-below＊ in which traditional progressive movements in civil society find common cause, because this is the most serious threat to humanity, the world economy and environment we＊ve seen in living memory.

( UR ) Beijing 〞 In a move signaling a point of no return in Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte＊s recent pivot to China, it was reported Tuesday the Philippines have granted a state-owned Chinese infrastructure group the right to build artificial islands in the South China Sea 〞 they very practice Duterte＊s predecessor had sought to restrict via U.N. intervention. 
※China Communication Construction Company (CCCC), a State-owned infrastructure group, recently signed a contract with the Philippines＊ Mega Harbour Port and Development Inc. to conduct a 208-hectare land reclamation project in Davao＊s harbour,§ wrote China＊s state-run People＊s Daily . 
To be built just off the Philippines＊ southern coast by ※moving sediment from the seafloor to a reef,§ the four islands ※will be used for government offices, businesses, residences, ports and industrial land.§ 
The CCCC Dredging chairman stated ※the project will elevate cooperation between China and the Philippines＊ port construction companies to a new height§ and that he ※expects the project to become a model for future cooperation between the two nations.§ 
It was barely three months ago that a United Nations arbitration court ruled China＊s nearly all-encompassing claim of territorial rights to the South China Sea was invalid. That case had been brought by the administration of Duterte＊s predecessor, President Benigno Aquino, because China had begun to construct artificial islands in those waters. 
Such a drastic shift in policy 〞 and the, admittedly, somewhat puzzling nature of it 〞 was remarked on by Steve Mollman who, writing for Quartz , reported on the new China-Philippines deal on Thursday: 
※You＊d think that rewarding China＊s dredging sector would be the last thing the Philippines wants to do. After all, in recent years Chinese dredging ships have been an unwelcome presence in parts of the South China Sea near the Philippines, helping to build islands atop reefs that then became Chinese military bases, complete with runways and ports.§ 

South China Sea, with Paracel and Spratly Islands. [Public domain] 
Indeed, for awhile it appeared the navies of China and the United States 〞 who physically intervened on the side of the Philippines 〞 would succumb to all-out war in the South China Sea. 
Tensions have since deescalated considerably, however, due in large part to the fact that Duterte, who＊s officially announced he intends for his country＊s future to unfold within the Chinese sphere of influence, has taken away the one thing the U.S. needed to stick its nose in the affairs of the region 〞 an excuse. 
※In this venue, your honors, in this venue, I announce my separation from the United States,§ Duterte said while speaking at the Great Hall of the People during a historic trip to Beijing last week. 
In that speech, the Filipino president made his reasoning for the pivot quite clear. ※America has lost,§ he said flatly. He made equally clear he wants to be a part of what he feels is the winning side: ※I＊ve realigned myself in your ideological flow and maybe I will also go to talk to (Russian President) Putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world 〞 China, Philippines and Russia. It＊s the only way.§ 
So Duterte is now allowing China to build fake islands in the South China Sea. 
That statement, in itself, is enough to raise the eyebrows of people following the developments in that region. And with regard to the South China Sea dispute 〞 on the Philippines front, at least 〞 Duterte, in a very real sense, is right. American has lost. Because, after all, it＊s awfully hard to convince folks of Chinese aggression when China and the country in question are cooperating voluntarily.",english,2016-10-28T05:04:59.821+03:00,blacklistednews.com,US,93026,Duterte Pulls a 180: China to Build Fake Islands Right Off Philippine Coast,0,http://www.blacklistednews.com/images/blacklistednews-LOGO-c1.png,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Protein From Meat: Which One Is Better For Your Body? by Arawma - Dulciuri Raw Vegane,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter It＊s very easy to come across conflicting information, especially in regards to the science of health and even more so when it comes to examining meat-based diets in comparison to plant-based ones. Plant-based diets can help prevent over over 60% of chronic disease deaths , yet people are still arguing whether veganism is a safe and sustainable diet. This is largely due to ※food industry science,§ which is full of bias and false information that＊s constantly used in both our education and health care systems. This is neither a secret nor a conspiracy theory, as many people within these industries have come out publicly to address these issues and emphasize the same points.   ※It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine§ 每 Dr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime Editor-in-Chief of the New England Medical Journal ( source ) A couple years ago, Dr Richard Horton, the current Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet, which is considered to be one of the most reputable medical journals in the world, stated that half of all published literature may be false. In his words, ※The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.§ ( source ) These are important points to consider when talking about science and it＊s extremely apparent in the food system, especially when discussing plant-based diets. We＊ve been hammered with the idea that meat is necessary for good health, even in an age where an enormous amount of professionals and publications have proven the nutritional benefits of a plant-based diet. It seems kind of fishy, especially given the fact that several billion animals are raised and killed for meat production annually, and that＊s just in America alone. Plant-Based Diets Compared To Meat If we look at ＆mainstream＊ science, scientists are only now starting to accept plant-based diets as a sustainable, healthy option and those doing the research are living, walking and talking examples of that. For instance Dr. Ellsworth Wareham, a 100-year-old, and a recently retired heart surgeon who has been a vegan for half of his life explains that:   ※Veganism is a very fine form of nutrition. It＊s a little extreme to tell a person who is using flesh foods that you＊re going to take everything entirely away from them. When I was in practice in medicine, I would tell the patients that the vegetable-based diet was the healthy way to go, and to keep away from the animal products as much as possible. People are very sensitive about what they eat. You can talk to people about exercising relaxation, good mental attitude and they will accept that. But you talk to them about what they are eating and people are very sensitive about that. If an individual is willing to listen, I will try to explain to them on a scientific basis of how I think it＊s better for them.§ 每 Dr. Ellsworth Wareham ( source ) Another example is Kim A. Williams, M.D ., incoming president of the American College of Cardiology, who also adopted a vegan diet. He often sees patients who are overweight and struggling with hypertension, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol. One of the things he advises them to do specifically is to go vegan. He is also the Chairman of Cardiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. His enthusiasm for a planet-based diet comes from his interpretation of medical literature, having cited several studies proving that people who pursue vegetarian diets lived longer than meat eaters and have lower rates of death from heart disease, diabetes and kidney problems. ( source) According to Harvard Medical School, ※ studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating. Nowadays, plant-based eating is recognized as not only nutritionally sufficient but also as a way to reduce the risk for many chronic illnesses.§ ( source ) There are a multitude of studies showing the benefits of vegetarian and vegan diets. For example, the American Dietetic Association weighed in with a position paper, concluding that ※appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.§ ( Journal of the American Dietetic Association , July 2009) ( source) 
These diseases include heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and more. Research carried out by Dr. Dean Ornish , who found that patients who were put on a program that included a vegetarian diet had less coronary plaque and fewer cardiac events, is also commonly cited. 
It＊s also important to note that when it comes to science and making ＆associations,＊ it＊s crucial to use the Bradford Hill Criteria . We all know that correlation does not mean causation, and that sometimes, correlation could mean causation. When you have a large number of studies showing such strong correlations, it＊s generally safe to assume that correlation in certain instances does mean causation. When it comes to plant based diets, there is no shortage of evidence that clearly outlines their health benefits. Obviously, the benefits of eating more plant based foods goes far beyond just correlation. This trend is gaining more scientific inquiry as popularity grows. At least 542,000 people in Britain now follow a vegan diet 每 up from 150,000 in 2006 每 and another 521,000 vegetarians hope to reduce their consumption of animal products. It is evident that veganism has become one of the fastest growing lifestyle choices. ( Source #2 ) One of the most comprehensive studies ever performed on this subject is ※ The China Study § conducted by Drs. T. Colin Campbell and Thomas Campbell. Their findings showed direct correlations between nutrition and heart-disease, diabetes, and cancer, proving that cultures that eat primarily plant-based diets have lower to no instances of these diseases and that switching to a plant-based diet can successfully reverse diseases already established in the body. The China Study is recognized as the most comprehensive nutritional study ever conducted on the relationship between diet and disease. I highly recommend watching the documentary Forks Over Knives (available on Netflix), which delves into this in more detail. 
The list of studies goes on and on, and if you＊d like to find more information, we recommend you research this subject yourself as there are far too many studies to include in this article. Plant Protein Compared To Vegan Protein ※The protein in animal products is filled with fats and chemicals and all sorts of stuff that＊s harmful to you. When I was competing and stuffing down all that stuff, I had lots of digestive problems, I was constipated and bloated, just miserable all the time. I don＊t concern myself with protein anymore, because there is enough in what I eat. I am not only healthy, but I feel better about myself and how I relate to other creatures in the world.§ Above are the words of Jim Morris , one of many competitive vegan bodybuilders, who has been vegan for most of his life. The last time we saw a vegan bodybuilder he was competing at this years Olympic Games in Brazil. His name is Kendrick Farris and he was the only American male weightlifter to compete in the Rio Olympics. You can read more about that here . If someone tells you, ※I need my protein,§ and that＊s why they eat meat, they are vastly misinformed. You don＊t need protein from meat to be healthy; in fact, it is the complete opposite, as plant-based protein is a healthier alternative. Clearly, the bodybuilders adopting these vegan diets are a great example, but let＊s look at what some of the ＆experts＊ have to say. According to Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a Harvard Medical School professor and Editor-in-Chief of the Harvard Heart Latter, ※When it comes to getting protein in your diet, meat isn＊t the only option. Mounting evidence shows that reducing meat and increasing plant-based protein is a healthier way to go. A diet with any type of meat raises the risk of heart disease and cancer, when compared with a vegetarian diet.§ ( source ) Evolve Your Inbox & Stay Conscious Daily Inspiration and all our best content, straight to your inbox. A more recent study conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital followed more than 130,000 people for 36 years, monitoring illnesses, lifestyles, diets and mortality rates. They found that substituting between 15g and 19g of animal protein, the equivalent of a single sausage, for legumes, pulses, nuts and other planet protein, significantly decreased the risk of early death. Replacing eggs with plant-based protein also lead to at 19 percent reduction in death risk. Researchers found that a 10 percent higher intake of meat was associated with a two percent higher mortality rate and an eight percent higher chance of cardiovascular death. According to Dr. T. Colin Campbell, mentioned earlier in the article from The China Study , ※What I did during the early part of my career was nothing more than what traditional science would suggest. I made the observation that diets presumably higher in animal protein were associated with liver cancer in the Philippines. When coupled with the extraordinary report from India showing that casein fed to experimental rats at the usual levels of intake dramatically promoted liver cancer, it prompted my 27-year-long study The China Project, of how this effect worked. We did dozens of experiments to see if this was true and, further, how it worked.§ 
In the study, Campbell emphasized the fact that they used the traditional criteria to decide what is a carcinogen (in regards to animal-based proteins) from the government＊s chemical carcinogenesis testing program. Campbell also stated that, ※this is not a debatable subject and the implications of this conclusion are staggering in so many ways.§ 
It also showed, among others, that animal protein is very acidic, and leak, and body takes calcium and phosphorus from the bones to neutralize the acidity. 
Below is a video of him explaining some of his findings. So, Which One Is Better? Obviously, there is information on both sides. The main point to remember here is that protein isn＊t the same. Protein is built from building blocks known as amino acids, and our bodies make them in two different ways. Perhaps not everybody＊s body is the same, and some can require what they need from scratch, or by modifying others. A short list of amino acids known as the essential amino acids need to come from food. According to current education, which is largely funded by food corporations who control animal agriculture, preaches that animal sources of protein tend to deliver all the amino acids we need. What they leave out about the animal protein is what you just read above. Other sources of protein lack one or more essential amino acids, but all a vegetarian or vegan individual needs to do is make sure they contain a variety of protein containing foods, which will help the body make more protein. That being said, studies on caloric restriction and fasting have shown that a high protein intake, too much, is definitely something you don＊t want. If you want to learn more about that, you can check out Dr Valter Longo , or check out some more of our articles on fasting . Certain meats have also been linked to several diseases. For example, research conducted at Harvard School of Public Health has found that eating even small amounts of red meat, especially processed red meat, on a regular basis is linked to an increased risk of heart disease and stroke, and the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease or any other cause. Certain meats are also known to cause cancer, and several other diseases. Replacing these meats with healthier sources of protein reversed the effects. ( source )( source ) Processed foods/meat are also known to cause cancer. While underconsumption of protein is harmful to the body, overconsumption comes with risks as well. In the United States, the average omnivore gets more than 1.5 times the optimal amount of protein , and most of that protein is from animal sources. This is bad news, because excess protein is turned into waste or turned into fat. This stored animal protein contributes to weight gain , heart disease , diabetes , inflammation and cancer . On the other hand, the protein contained in whole plant foods is connected to disease prevention. According to Michelle McMacken , MD, a board-certified internal medicine physician and an assistant professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine: ※[T]he protein found in whole plant foods protects us from many chronic diseases. There is no need to track protein intake or use protein supplements with plant-based diets; if you are meeting your daily calorie needs, you will get plenty of protein. The longest-lived people on Earth, those living in the ※ Blue Zones ,§ get about 10% of their calories from protein, compared with the U.S. average of 15-20%.§ 
Obviously, there are is a great wealth of information out there, and what I＊ve presented here is just a tidbit. There are also other factors to consider these days as well, such as industry influence over scientific publications, and more.

Exclusive: Filipino President Duterte oversaw a brutal anti-drug campaign but is now seeking peace with leftist revolutionaries and rejecting U.S. pressure for more counterinsurgency warfare, writes Marjorie Cohn. 
By Marjorie Cohn 
In April 2016, Rodrigo Duterte won the Philippine presidential election by a landslide, with more than 6 million votes. He openly declared that he was the nation＊s first Left president, calling himself a socialist but not a communist. So far, his regime has been controversial, to put it mildly. 
The U.S. press has focused on Duterte＊s vicious war on drugs that claimed upwards of 2,000 lives and led to the incarceration of tens of thousands of people. His decision to allow former Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos＊s burial in the National Cemetery of the Heroes also has drawn the ire of those who recall Marcos＊s brutal two-decade regime that killed more than 3,000, tortured tens of thousands, and stole $10 billion from the Philippines. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte (Photo credit: rodrigo-duterte.com) 
But, significantly, Duterte is engaging with revolutionary forces in the peace process that aims to end 47 years of armed struggle against the repressive Filipino government. And Duterte has taken actions that, for the first time, challenge the longstanding military and economic power of the United States in the Philippines. 
Peace Process With Opposition 
Since 1969, a civil war has been raging in the Philippines. The roots of the armed conflict can be traced to the colonial and neocolonial domination of the Philippines by the Spanish, then U.S. imperialism, feudal exploitation by big landlords and capitalist interests, as well as widespread bureaucratic corruption. After Duterte＊s election, he cited peace as a top priority of his administration, vowing to engage in peace negotiations with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP). 
According to JustPeacePH, an international platform that supports the Philippine peace process and takes its name from its Internet site, ※justpeace.ph,§ ※The daily, systematic and systemic injustice experienced by the people drive them to desire and seek fundamental changes in society through various means. But because the forces against fundamental social change use all means including the instruments and violence of the state to defend the status quo, many Filipinos over many generations have embraced armed struggle to overthrow the ruling system.§ 
The NDFP ※is the alliance of progressive forces seeking to bring about fundamental change in the existing social system in the Philippines through armed revolution,§ JustPeacePH states in its Primer on Just and Lasting Peace in the Philippines. The NDFP alliance includes trade unions, peasants, youth, women, national minorities, teachers, health workers, religious clergy, the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), and the New People＊s Army. 
Duterte＊s Peace Initiative 
Two rounds of peace negotiations have already occurred since Duterte took office, with a third scheduled for January 2017 in Oslo, Norway. 
In May, Duterte declared he would release all political prisoners, which number more than 400, through a presidential declaration of amnesty, provided both houses of congress approve. Nineteen NDFP consultants, who have been involved in the revolutionary movement for years, have already been released. 
Duterte offered four cabinet positions to the CCP, but they declined, stating there must first be a comprehensive peace agreement. The CCP, however, recommended a veteran peasant leader who was appointed Secretary of Agrarian Reform and a veteran academic activist leader who was named secretary of social welfare and development. 
※These are major appointments,§ Luis Jalandoni, NDFP＊s Senior Adviser on the Peace Negotiating Panel, told me at a recent conference of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers in Lisbon, Portugal. 
NDFP has a people＊s army and organs of political power with mass organizations in 71 out of the 81 provinces in the country, Jalandoni said. He noted that landlessness and poverty afflict the 100 million people in the Philippines. 
※The NDFP insists on addressing the roots of the armed conflict in order to achieve a just and lasting peace,§ Jalandoni said. 
The demands in the peace talks are: Release of all political prisoners; Land reform for the peasantry (70% of the population); National industrialization to develop the economy using available human and natural resources; Protect the environment and ancestral lands of the indigenous peoples; and Philippine national sovereignty and abrogation of all unequal treaties with the United States. 
Challenging U.S. Power 
U.S. domination and interference in the Philippines date back to 1898, when the United States annexed the Philippines. The U.S. continued to exercise colonial rule over the country until 1946, when the Philippines gained its independence although the United States retained many military installations there and the Filipino economy maintained its dependence on the U.S. President George W. Bush, seen announcing the start of his invasion of Iraq on March 19, 2003, included the Philippines in his ※global war on terror.§ 
With U.S. assistance, Marcos ruled the Philippines with an iron fist from 1965 through 1986, under martial law from 1972 to 1981. In 2002, the Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo government developed Oplan Bayanihan, a counterinsurgency program modeled on U.S. strategies. After 9/11, the Bush administration gave Arroyo $100 million to fund that campaign in the Philippines. 
Oplan Bayanihan led to large numbers of extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, torture and cruel treatment. Many civilians, including children, have been killed. Philippine military and paramilitary death squads murdered hundreds of members of progressive organizations. Communities and leaders opposed to large-scale and invasive mining have been targeted. Even ordinary people with no political affiliation have not escaped the government＊s reign of terror. 
From 2001 to 2010, the U.S. government provided more than $507 in military assistance to the Philippine government, facilitating tremendous repression. 
Between 2010 and 2015, the Philippine police, military and paramilitary forces perpetrated extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, torture, illegal arrests and forced evacuation, many to enable extraction by mining companies. 
The 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, which President Barack Obama negotiated with Duterte＊s predecessor, gave U.S. troops the right to prolonged deployment in the Philippines. The agreement is widely seen in the Philippines as a threat to the country＊s sovereignty. 
In September 2016, Duterte declared, ※I am not a fan of the Americans ＃ Filipinos should be first before everybody else.§ He added, ※In our relations to the world, the Philippines will pursue an independent foreign policy. I repeat: The Philippines will pursue an independent foreign policy.§ 
The United States has not apologized for all the atrocities it committed against the Filipino people, Duterte said. Responding to U.S. criticism of the Philippines for its human rights violations, he stated, ※Why are you Americans killing the black people there, shooting them down when they are already on the ground.§ 
Duterte promised to end joint military maneuvers with U.S. forces and expel the hundreds of U.S. troops currently stationed in the Philippines. He also expressed his intention to end bilateral agreements concluded by his predecessor with the United States and reverse permission for the United States＊ use of five Philippine military bases. 
※I will break up with America,§ Duterte said. ※I would rather go to Russia and to China.§ He vowed to rescind joint patrols with U.S. and Filipino forces against Chinese expansion in the disputed South China Sea. Indeed, Duterte recently traveled to China and secured valuable fishing rights for Filipinos in the South China Sea. 
Hope for Peace Prospects 
In an unprecedented development, both the government and the opposition declared unilateral ceasefires in August. But there are still problems with the government＊s ceasefire, says Jalandoni, as Duterte doesn＊t have full control of the military. The military and paramilitary forces, which are protected by the military, have engaged in several violations that imperil the ceasefire, he said. 
※There is high optimism that the peace talks will prosper under the presidency of Duterte,§ according to JustPeacePH. ※Unlike past presidents who harbor strong anti-communist bias, Duterte seems capable of rethinking the government＊s peace strategy since he claims to be a socialist.§ 
Opposition forces are not uncritical of the excesses in Duterte＊s war on drugs. The CCP declared the campaign is becoming anti-people and anti-democratic. Due process must be respected, human rights must be upheld; the drug users and small drug dealers, who come from poverty, require rehabilitation and care, the CCP maintains. 
※Understandably, Duterte＊s war on drugs and other crimes is given more coverage by the global media,§ JustPeacePH wrote in its primer. ※But Duterte＊s aim to establish a lasting peace in the provinces deserves even more attention as this strikes at the root causes of the problem of illegal drugs and related crimes.§ 
Jalandoni said, ※Duterte is not a saint but he stands for an independent foreign policy. His stand against the United States is respected and has received a lot of support.§ 
The NDFP, Jalandoni noted, says that ※if there are threats against Duterte by U.S. imperialism, the Left will be a reliable ally to him,§ adding, ※He is the first president to stand up to the United States.§

I＊ve written a couple pieces of the smoking hot issue in Pivotland, Philippine president Duterte＊s swerve toward a pro-PRC foreign policy, and what the U.S. and pro-American sector of the Manila elite are going to do about it. 
The first piece, Reports of death of US-Philippine alliance may be exaggerated, addresses the fact that Duterte＊s freedom of movement is constrained by the need to keep the Philippine military happy, and notes that ex-prez and retired general Fidel Ramos, who facilitated Duterte＊s entrance on the national political stage, is signaling dissatisfaction with Duterte. 
The second piece, Duterte Plays the ＆Mamasapano＊ Card, covers a Duterte counter-attack: a threat to relitigate the death of 44 Philippine National Police commandos at Mamasapano in Mindanao, a 2014 special ops fiasco conducted under the aegis of the United States which a) exposes ex-president Aquino to serious legal jeopardy b) posits that the US alliance is doing a better job of killing Filipinos than the PRC can ever hope to do. 
The US seems to be embedded in a colonial mindset when it comes to the Philippines, something along the lines of ※we＊ve been selflessly looking after the Philippines for a century, and that thug Duterte won＊t be allowed to screw that up during his brief (maybe curtailed) presidency.§ 
It takes a pretty superficial view of Philippine history, one that accepts the US self-definition as the Philippines＊ security savior while ignoring the distortions and shortcomings of the colonial and neo-colonial relationship. 
For me this tunnel vision was typified by the US media crowing over the formal delivery of a refurbished C-130 transport to the Philippine government by outgoing ambo Philip Goldberg. Message: here＊s the US making provisions for Philippine defense at the same time Duterte＊s selling out the country to China. 
To me, the inadvertent message was 1) here＊s the US blindly stroking the pivot fetish while Duterte tries to solve the Mindanao insurgency that has cost at least 400,000 lives over the last century, win his drug war, and find a place for the Philippines in Asia that doesn＊t give primacy to the US preoccupation confronting the PRC and 2) the U.S., in my opinion, pretty much has a policy of keeping the Philippines flat on its behind as an independent military force by trickling out second-hand gear to the Philippine military while the sweet stuff is dangled in front of it during US joint military maneuvers and port calls. 
But the United States is trying to find political leverage wherever it can and the Western media will, I＊m sure, put its shoulder to the wheel to help out. 
Philip Goldberg sat down for a 45-minute exit interview with Rappler. As befitting Rappler＊s origins in the Soros/Omidyar network of pro-US globalization advocacy, the interview was a stream of softballs about what to do about Duterte＊s disregard of the awesomeness of the American relationship, an awesomeness that is acknowledged by virtually all Filipinos who inexplicably (and, if the US has anything to do about it, temporarily) at the same time give Duterte approval ratings of over 80%. 
It＊s worth watching if you have the patience. Goldberg is a smooth cat, and the Rappler tonguebath gives you no inkling of the fact that he intimately familiar with the wet work of end-arounding national governments to cultivate secessionist movements, you know, like what he did in Bolivia (declared persona non grata as a result) and Kosovo, and like that thing in Duterte＊s home province of Mindanao, which in my opinion probably the main reason why Duterte wanted him out of the Philippines. 
Goldberg also discretely plays the economic threat card, concern-trolling that anti-US attitudes will dismay ※foreign investors§. 
It will be interesting to see how this plays out in subsequent weeks. As far as I can tell, the biggest U.S. factor in the domestic Philippine economy is the call-center industry. I doubt US corporations are interested in actually pulling their operations out and subjecting them to the English-language mercies of India, but certainly a call from the State Department or White House would convince them of the wisdom of at least making the threat. 
And I also wonder if expected President Hillary Clinton will find it necessary to drop the hammer on Duterte, in order to demonstrate to a rather dubious Asia that there is no alternative to loyalty to the pivot. 
I expect the next few months, in other words, to be very interesting.",english,2016-10-28T21:58:24.067+03:00,counterpunch.org,US,23950,It＊s ON! Between Duterte and America,0,http://i1.wp.com/www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/dropzone/2015/06/OGFB4.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

If there is much talk about such a possibility, it is mainly because of the tensions between the United States and Russia. Tensions between the two most powerful nuclear states in the world have never been this high since the end of the Cold War in 1989 and the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991.
There are at least two flash points, one more dangerous than the other. In Eastern Ukraine, Russian backed rebels will not surrender to the US supported regime in Kiev because they see US control over Ukraine as part of a much larger agenda to expand NATO power to the very borders of Russia. This has been happening for some years now.
But it is the Washington-Moscow confrontation in Allepo, Syria which portends to a huge conflagration. The US is protective of major militant groups such as Al-Nusra which has besieged Eastern Allepo and is seeking to overthrow the Bashar al-Assad government. Washington has also set its sight on ＆regime change＊ in Damascus ever since the latter＊s determined resistance to Israeli occupation of the strategic Golan Heights in Syria from 1967 onwards.
The drive for regime change intensified with the US-Israeli quest for a ※new Middle East§ following the Anglo-American invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003. It became more pronounced in 2009 when Bashar al-Assad rejected a proposal to allow a gas pipe-line from Qatar to Europe to pass through his country, a pipe-line which would have reduced Europe＊s dependence upon Russia for gas. Russia of course has been a long-standing ally of Syria. Together with Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah, it is helping the Syrian government to break the siege of Eastern Allepo and to defeat militants in other parts of Syria.
It is obvious that in both instances, in Ukraine and Syria, the US has not been able to achieve what it wants. The US has also been stymied in Southeast Asia where its attempt to re-assert its power through its 2010 ＆Pivot to Asia＊ policy has suffered a serious setback as a result of the decision of the new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, to pursue an independent foreign policy that no longer adheres blindly to US interests. At the same time, China continues to expand and enhance its economic strength in Asia and the world through its One Belt One Road (OBOR) projects and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and via its leadership of BRICS. China＊s regional and global economic role is leading to its pronounced presence in security and military matters. As a result of all this, the US＊s imperial power has clearly diminished. It is a hegemon in decline.
It is because it is not prepared to accept its decline that some US generals are threatening to demonstrate US＊s military might. If a hegemon is a danger to humankind when it is at its pinnacle, it becomes an even greater threat to peace when its power is diminishing. Like a wounded tiger, it becomes even more furious and ferocious. A new US president may be inclined to give vent to this frustration through an arrogant display of military power.
How can we check such wanton arrogance? There will be elements in the elite stratum of US society itself who would be opposed to the US going to war. We saw a bit of this in 2013 when those who were itching to launch military strikes against Syria based upon dubious ※evidence§ of the government＊s use of chemical weapons were thwarted by others with a saner view of the consequences of war. It is also important to observe that none of the US＊s major allies in Europe wants a war. Burdened by severe challenges related to the economy and migration, the governments know that their citizens will reject any move towards war either on the borders of Russia or in Syria and West Asia.
This also suggests that a self-absorbed European citizenry may not have the enthusiasm to mobilise against an imminent war. Let us not forget that it was in European cities from London to Berlin that the biggest demonstrations against the war in Iraq took place in 2003. Anti-war protests will have to be initiated elsewhere this time.
Governments in Moscow and Beijing, in Tehran and Jakarta, in Pretoria and La Paz, should come out openly against war. They should encourage other governments in the Global South and the Global North to denounce any move towards a war that will engulf the whole of humanity. Citizens all over the world should condemn war through a variety of strategies ranging from signature campaigns and letters to the media to public rallies and street demonstrations.
In this campaign against an imminent war, the media, both conventional and alternative, will have a huge role to play. It is unfortunate that well-known media outlets in the West have supported war in the past. It is time that they atone for their sins!

This is the only morality. 
Philippine Star : 
If his scathing and vulgar comments are causing consternation and worry among American investors and businessmen, President Duterte said yesterday they can always pack up and leave. 
Duterte was reacting to pronouncements from visiting US State Department Assistant Secretary Daniel Russel that his conflicting statements were causing jitters among US businessmen. 
a??Go ahead. Pack your bags. We will sacrifice. We will recover, I assure you. We will live and survive. We have gone through the worst of times in this planet,a?? the President said in a press briefing at the NAIA Terminal 2 shortly before his departure for Japan. 
Russel on Friday said Dutertea??s recent statements a?? especially his a??separationa?? from the US a?? have ushered in a a??climate of uncertainty.a?? 
a??The succession of controversial statements, comments and a real climate of uncertainty about the Philippinesa?? intentions have created consternation in a number of countries,a?? Russel told reporters Monday after meeting Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. in Manila. 
a??Not only in mine and not only among governments, but also growing concern in other communities, in the expat Filipino community, in corporate boardrooms as well.a?? 
Duterte called the US official gago or stupid for asking him to tone down his anti-US rhetoric, saying it was Washington that started the rift between them. 
a??I had a talk with Secretary Yasay and herea??s a guy his name is Russel, if you can just tone down our rhetoric. But I was not the one who started this rift. They are the ones who started it,a?? the President told reporters. 
He noted that during the campaign, Ambassador Philip Goldberg got his goat when the diplomat reacted to his joke about the rape-slay of an Australian missionary during a 1989 prison riot in Davao City. 
a??Remember, it all started during the election. I made a comment in narration of an actual event which happened in Davao and which was covered by all media outlets there. The ambassador said something not very nice,a?? he pointed out. 
a??You are not supposed to do that because in an election of another country, you should be careful with your mouth,a?? he said, addressing Goldberg. 
KIKE Goldberg. 
In the final stretch of the campaign, Duterte joked about the rape and murder of Australian missionary Jacqueline Hamill during a prison riot. He said Hamill looked like an actress and as mayor a??he should have been first.a?? His remarks drew condemnation from several quarters, particularly womena??s groups. 
The rising death toll in the Duterte administrationa??s war on drugs has sparked concerns among Western countries, particularly the US and the European Union. 
For Duterte, Russela??s statement was an insult. a??I said dona??t do that to me. Every time they threaten us, including the EU (European Union), they think they are brighter than us,a?? Duterte said. 
a??Then they will say a??be careful, we will put you in prison.a?? Son of a w***e. Go ahead.a?? 
Duterte maintained he would never be subservient to the interests of the US or any other foreign country. 
a??You know before we can move forward, Mr. America, there are things a?? so many things a?? the massacre of the Filipinos before. These are historical hurts that would never go away,a?? he said. He had earlier called the attention of the US to the massacre by its soldiers of hundreds of Muslims in the early 20th century. 
a??I am not also a lapdog of any country. Only the Filipinos can treat me as a lapdog. Period. Nothing else. 
a??Do not make us dogs. Do not. As if I am a dog with a leash and then you throw bread far away that I cannot reach.a?? 
Duterte had previously branded US President Barack Obama a a??son of a b***ha?? and told him to a??go to hell.a?? 
Duterte also hit Russel for supposedly being too nervous about his recent state visit to China. 
a??Now, what did I tell to China? I went there, just being nice,a?? the President said. a??I am just a small person. How can I cause distress? You are nervous because you are guilty.a?? 
Duterte said his state visit to China last week triggered a lot of speculations. 
a??Napakabilis ng malisya ng mga gago (These fools were quick to think maliciously). We did not talk about anything in China except to cook siopao and chopsuey,a?? the President said in jest. 
Duterte also scored Goldberga??s statement that the US remains committed to defend the Philippines. 
a??There will be no wars anymore. Who will wage war with us? China? What will they get? Japan? What defense? They want to talk about the boogeyman war,a?? the President said. 
a??Stop that s**t. Nobody is interested in wars anymore. And if there is a fight, you fight your wars. Do not include mine.§ 
Pure shitlordery. 
So great to see. 
And just for those who don＊t get it: Duterte is not ※anti-American,§ he is anti-ZOGmerican. Filipinos have no problem with the American people, they have a problem with being slaves to international kike financial institutions and then, as already enslaved through massive debt programs and foreign ownership of infrastructure, being told by the Jew globalists that they＊re not allowed to slaughter drug dealers because it＊s mean. 
Duterte is doing what every leader should be doing by default: defending the people from enemies foreign and domestic.

These days it＊s not very often a nation can say their leader has the approval of the Almighty God himself, but now, the Philippines can claim this distinction. 
The Washington Post : 
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has made a solemn promise: no more swearing. 
Duterte, who famously cursed the pope and used a slang term that translates as a?? son of a whore § while denouncing President Obama, said he was flying back from Japan late Thursday, looking at a vast expanse of sky, listening to his colleagues snore, when he heard a voice say, a??If you dona??t stop epithets, I will bring this plane down now.a?? 
I know many of you may be skeptical of his claim, but not me. I＊ve heard people claim they spoke to God many times in my life, and until now, there was always some personal agenda involved. When I was a kid, I had relatives tell me God wanted me to have a crew cut. Then there were the more famous situations like Oral Roberts saying that if his flock didn＊t send him ten million dollars by a specified date, God would kill him, personally. 
Then you had guys like Ted Haggard. I＊m pretty sure God told him it wasn＊t a good idea to be snorting meth off the units of male prostitutes while he was the pastor of an evangelical megachurch and spiritual advisor to the likes of George W. Bush, but if so, God＊s words went unheeded. 
Not so with the infamous Flip shitlord. 
a??And I said, a??Who is this?a?? So, of course, a??ita??s God,a??a?? he told Filipino journalists late Thursday. 
a??So, I promise God,a?? he continued, a??Not [to] express slang, cuss words and everything. So you guys hear me right always because [a] promise to God is a promise to the Filipino people.a?? God＊s servant on Earth, Rodrigo Duterte, contemplating the sound of one hand killing all the drug lords. 
Now there＊s a man with his priorities straight. He identifies the speaker, and makes his promise, publicly, to God and his people, that he will obey. Of course, all fascists believe in a natural hierarchy, so his obedience just makes sense. 
An important thing to note is, when God speaks, what he doesn＊t say is just as important as what he said. He told Duterte, ※stop cussing.§ Nothing more. 
Thank goodness he did not say ※stop killing criminals.§ I was pretty sure he wouldn＊t, but you never know. What a relief＃

Donald Trump is warning America that Hillary Clinton＊s insane idea to create a no-fly zone over Syria would lead to World War Three with Russia, Syria and Iran.
Setting up a no-fly zone over Syria means telling the government of Syria (as well as Russia) they＊re not allowed to fly planes over their own country, even though they＊re in the middle of a war with ISIS and other US-backed rebel terrorist groups.
It＊s completely psychotic, that＊s why even leftists like Green party candidate Jill Stein have said Hillary is ※much scarier§ than Trump and could slide us ※into a nuclear war§ with Russia .
As you＊ll see in this article, Reuters asked Hillary to defend her insane plan but she just dodged the question and instead attacked Trump as ※unfit to be commander-in-chief.§
From Reuters :
U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Democrat Hillary Clinton＊s plan for Syria would ※lead to World War Three,§ because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear-armed Russia.
In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State is a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy.
Trump questioned how Clinton would negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin after demonizing him; blamed President Barack Obama for a downturn in U.S. relations with the Philippines under its new president, Rodrigo Duterte; bemoaned a lack of Republican unity behind his candidacy, and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders would support him.
※If we had party unity, we couldn＊t lose this election to Hillary Clinton,§ he said.
On Syria＊s civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict.
Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ※safe zones§ on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets.
※What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,§ said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. ※You＊re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.
※You＊re not fighting Syria any more, you＊re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,§ he said.
Clinton＊s campaign dismissed the criticism, noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts have denounced Trump as unfit to be commander-in-chief.
※Once again, he is parroting Putin＊s talking points and playing to Americans＊ fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria,§ Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said in a statement.
Trump said Assad is much stronger now than he was three years ago and said getting Assad to leave power was less important than defeating Islamic State.
※Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,§ he said.
A memo was leaked earlier this year showing Hillary Clinton＊s State Department said on December 31, 2012 that overthrowing Syria was the ※best way to help Israel.§ 

The foreign policy goals in that State Department memo just so happen to align with the goals of this powerful Israeli think tank :

Seeing as how the U.S. just last month conducted an airstrike on a group of Syrian fighters to help ISIS overrun one of their positions , it＊s not unreasonable to question what the hell is actually going on here.
Uniting with Assad and Russia to destroy ISIS, as Trump has said he would do, is without a doubt the sane plan in Syria if one wants to pursue America＊s interests. Instead, Clinton and Obama are trying to both overthrow Assad by arming ※good§ rebel groups and somehow also kill ISIS on the side 每 though it just so happens the weapons they＊re giving to the ※good§ rebels keep falling into ISIS＊s hands.
The result has been what we＊re seeing in Syria 每 an endless, drawn out war leading to untold human misery, suffering, death and the migrant crisis.

W ars are not fought against flags or ideas, nations or demonized dictators. They are fought against people, 98 percent of whom are resistant to killing, and most of whom had little or nothing to do with bringing on the war. One way to dehumanize those people is to replace all of them with an image of a single monstrous individual. 
Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, said that war is ※easier for people to understand if there＊s a face to the enemy.§ He gave examples: ※Hitler, Ho Chi Minh, Saddam Hussein, Milosevic.§ Fitzwater might well have included the name Manuel Antonio Noriega. When the first President Bush sought, among other things, to prove he was no ※wimp§ by attacking Panama in 1989, the most prominent justification was that Panama＊s leader was a mean, drug-crazed, weirdo with a pockmarked face who liked to commit adultery. An important article in the very serious New York Times on December 26, 1989, began ※The United States military headquarters here, which has portrayed General Manuel Antonio Noriega as an erratic, cocaine-snorting dictator who prays to voodoo gods, announced today that the deposed leader wore red underwear and availed himself of prostitutes.§ Never mind that Noriega had worked for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), including at the time he＊d stolen the 1984 election in Panama. (U.S. outrage at interference in elections is extremely new.) Never mind that his real offense was refusing to back U.S. war making against Nicaragua. Never mind that the United States had known about Noriega＊s drug trafficking for years and continued working with him. This man snorted cocaine in red underwear with women not his wife. ※That is aggression as surely as Adolf Hitler＊s invasion of Poland 50 years ago was aggression,§ declared Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger of Noriega＊s drug trafficking. The invading U.S. liberators even claimed to find a big stash of cocaine in one of Noriega＊s homes, although it turned out to be tamales wrapped in banana leaves. And what if the tamales really had been cocaine? Would that, like the discovery of actual ※weapons of mass destruction§ in Baghdad in 2003 have justified war? 
Fitzwater＊s reference to ※Milosevic§ was, of course, to Slobodan Milosevic, then president of Serbia, whom David Nyhan of the Boston Globe in January 1999 called ※the closest thing to Hitler Europe has confronted in the last half century.§ Except, you know, for all the other ones. By 2010, the practice in U.S. domestic politics of comparing anyone you disagreed with to Hitler had become almost comical, but it is a practice that has helped launch many wars and may still launch more. However, it takes two to tango: in 1999, Serbs were calling the president of the United States ※Bill Hitler.§ 
In the spring of 1914, in a movie theater in Tours, France, an image of Wilhelm II, the Emperor of Germany, came on the screen for a moment. All hell broke loose. 
※Everybody yelled and whistled, men, women, and children, as if they had been personally insulted. The good natured people of Tours, who knew no more about the world and politics than what they had read in their newspapers, had gone mad for an instant,§ according to Stefan Zweig. But the French would not be fighting Kaiser Wilhelm II. They would be fighting ordinary people who happened to be born a little ways away from themselves in Germany. 
Increasingly, over the years, we＊ve been told that wars are not against people, but purely against bad governments and their evil leaders. Time after time we fall for tired rhetoric about new generations of ※precision§ weapons that our leaders pretend can target oppressive regimes without harming the people we think we＊re liberating. And we fight wars for ※regime change.§ If the wars don＊t end when the regime has been changed, that＊s because we have a responsibility to take care of the ※unfit§ creatures, the little children, whose regimes we＊ve changed. Yet, there＊s no established record of this doing any good. The United States and its allies did relatively well by Germany and Japan following World War II, but could have done so for Germany following World War I and skipped the sequel. Germany and Japan were reduced to rubble, and U.S. troops have yet to leave. That＊s hardly a useful model for new wars. 
With wars or warlike actions the United States has overthrown governments in Hawaii, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Nicaragua, Honduras, Iran, Guatemala, Vietnam, Chile, Grenada, Panama, Afghanistan, and Iraq, not to mention the Congo (1960); Ecuador (1961 & 1963); Brazil (1961 & 1964); the Dominican Republic (1961 & 1963); Greece (1965 & 1967); Bolivia (1964 & 1971); El Salvador (1961); Guyana (1964); Indonesia (1965); Ghana (1966); and of course Haiti (1991 & 2004). We＊ve replaced democracy with dictatorship, dictatorship with chaos, and local rule with U.S. domination and occupation. 
In no case has a U.S. war clearly reduced evil. In most cases, including Iran and Iraq, U.S. invasions and U.S.-backed coups have led to severe repression, disappearances, extra-judicial executions, torture, corruption, and prolonged setbacks for the democratic aspirations of ordinary people. 
The focus on rulers in wars is not motivated by humanitarianism so much as propaganda. People enjoy fantasizing that a war is a duel between great leaders. This requires demonizing one and glorifying another.

By now it should be clear to all but the blindest (or rabidly disingenuous) that the United Nations is an organization that has been co-opted by the nefarious interests of Muslim nations and their despotic third world allies. It is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy. An organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as today's greatest purveyor of Judeophobia, historical revisionism and conspiracy theories. This fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) that deny the indisputable Jewish nexus to the holy city. 
On April 12, the 58-member body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly one-sided resolution that referred to Jewish holy sites in Jerusalem exclusively by their Muslim names and designated the Temple Mount, Judaism＊s holiest site, as a ※Muslim holy site of worship.§ To add insult to injury, the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that Israel was ※planting Jewish fake graves in other spaces of the Muslim cemeteries.§ 
Unsurprisingly, the resolution, which was submitted by seven Muslim nations, passed by a wide margin with 33 votes in favor, six against and 17 abstentions. Two nations were absent for the vote. France, Sweden, Slovenia and Spain shamefully supported the vile resolution. 
That the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of Muslim and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of UNESCO but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner European support and Israel could thus claim a moral victory. France with its collaborationist past and proclivity to kowtow to the world＊s despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble. 
But following the vote, a crack appeared in the fa?ade of anti-Israel invective so prevalent at the U.N. It appeared that France was having a case of buyer＊s remorse. In an address to the French parliament, Prime Minister Manuel Valls termed the resolution ※clumsy§ and ※unfortunate.§ He then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that ※France will never deny the Jewish presence and Jewish history in Jerusalem. It would make no sense; it is absurd to deny this history.§ 
France is one of Europe＊s strongest advocates for the Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority and their Muslim allies at UNESCO should have understood from Valls＊ statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic European support. Instead of declaring victory and moving on, they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in October. 
The October 13 resolution , sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the April resolution. It condemned Israel for various contrived transgressions and again severed the Jewish (and Christian) nexus to the city. This time however, the Muslim bloc was in for a rude awakening. While the resolution passed, the Muslim bloc was unable to garner a majority in the 58-member body. 
Of the 24 nations that voted in favor of the resolution (Mexico later withdrew support lowering the final tally to 23), 14 were composed of states with Muslim majorities while a fifteenth, Nigeria, is 50 percent Muslim, making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion. What was notable was the fact that this time around, the resolution failed to garner a single western European concurrence. Other developing nations, like India, which had hitherto supported Arab-sponsored drafts also abstained. Israel＊s behind-the-scenes political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the Muslim initiative was paying dividends. 
Following the resolution＊s passage, the Palestinians and their Muslim allies suffered additional political reversals. Mexico , asked for a revote because it wished to withdraw support for the motion. Mexico's Secretariat of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that his government＊s changed position ※reiterates the recognition that the Government of Mexico gives the undeniable link of the Jewish people to the cultural heritage of East Jerusalem.§ 
Brazil soon followed suit echoing Mexico＊s position. In a statement, the Brazilian government noted that it would no longer support such one-sided resolutions. Italy, which had abstained, went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told an Italian radio station that these resolutions were ※incomprehensible, unacceptable and wrong.§ He added that ※to say that the Jews have no links to Jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness.§ 
Even UNESCO＊s director-general, Irina Bokova voiced disapproval by stating that ※the heritage of Jerusalem is indivisible, and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city.§ She later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion. 
On Wednesday, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan introduced a third draft resolution to UNESCO＊s World Heritage Committee seeking to generate further political terrorism. The proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the Jewish nexus to the city and its holy sites. The 21-member WHC body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise move, Croatia and Tanzania asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the Muslim bloc. Instead of the motion passing by consensus, the vote was 10 in favor, two opposed, eight abstentions and one nation absent. 
The two nations opposing were Tanzania and the Philippines. Of the 10 ayes, seven were Muslim. It was a pyrrhic victory at best. 
Given the large number of Muslim countries represented at the U.N. and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against Israel, it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed. But as evidenced by recent Arab political reversals, gone are the days that the Palestinians can rely on automatic European and non-aligned support. 
Israel has been effectively reaching out to the so-called non-aligned nations and it is having a significant positive impact. Part of the Israeli success lies in the fact that the Jewish state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water technology, agriculture, energy, counter-terrorism, cyber warfare and arms. This outreach has translated to political dividends at the U.N. 
Nevertheless, the UNESCO resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many U.N. member states. It also underscores the need for the United States to maintain its commitment and assurance to Israel that it will never allow the U.N. to impose terms and dictates on Israel. 
There have been rumors circulating that Barack Obama in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on Israel utilizing the UN Security Council. The White House has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation. 
The administration＊s objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed anti-Israel resolution, likely introduced by France, or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto. In addition to betraying long-standing commitments to Israel and running counter to strong bipartisan opposition, the notion that the United States would throw Israel under the bus and allow those who engage in despotism and blatant anti-Semitism to have a say on Israel＊s fate, is beyond asinine. Hopefully, the outrageous conduct exhibited at UNESCO steers the administration in the right direction.",english,2016-10-28T07:55:01.169+03:00,frontpagemag.com,US,34811,The Battle at UNESCO,0,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/sw.jpg?itok=bxOjUWH-,0,1,0,0,0,hate,Neutral

In one of the immortal lines of Godfather 2 , mafia boss Michael Corleone discusses the fate of his brother, who betrayed him, with his enforcer. ※I don＊t want anything to happen to him while my mother is alive,§ Corleone said. 
Message received. The brother was murdered after their mother＊s funeral. Last week it was reported that the Obama administration has delivered a message to the Palestinian Authority. The administration has warned the PA that the US will veto any anti-Israel resolution brought before the UN Security Council before the US presidential elections on November 8. Message received. Open season on Israel at the Security Council will commence November 9. The Palestinians are planning appropriately. Israel needs to plan, too. Israel＊s most urgent diplomatic mission today is to develop and implement a strategy that will outflank President Barack Obama in his final eight weeks in power. Lobbying the administration is pointless. Obama has waited eight years to exact his revenge on Israel for not supporting his hostile, strategically irrational policies. And he has no interest in letting bygones be bygones. Before turning to what Israel must do, first we need to understand what Israel can do. A good place to begin is by considering what just transpired at UNESCO, where twice in a week, UNESCO bodies resolved to erase 3,000 years of Jewish history in Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. The fight that Israel waged at UNESCO is not the fight it needs to wage at the Security Council. The stakes at the Security Council are far higher. Like the UN General Assembly, UNESCO＊s decisions are non-binding declarations that have no legal or operational significance. As such, there is no reason to expend great resources to fight them. For Israel, the goal of the fight at UNESCO is not to defeat anti-Israel initiatives. That is impossible given the Palestinians＊ automatic majority. The purpose of the fight at UNESCO is to humiliate European governments that side with antisemitic initiatives, and to weaken the congenitally anti-Israel body itself. The government achieved both of these objectives. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi＊s disavowal of his own government＊s abstention from the vote on the first resolution 每 like the similar position taken after the fact by the Mexican government 每 was a diplomatic victory for Israel. So too, the fact that UNESCO＊s own Secretary-General Irina Bukova felt compelled to disavow her own agency＊s actions by rejecting the resolution＊s denial of the Jewish people＊s ties to Jerusalem was a significant victory for Israel. Her statement was deeply damaging for UNESCO and its reputation. Finally, the fact that Tanzania and the Philippines voted against the resolution was a testament to Israel＊s capacity to convince other governments to abandon their traditional pro-Palestinian voting pattern. The Palestinians won the vote at UNESCO because they are more powerful diplomatically than Israel. They have an automatic anti-Israel majority. But they weren＊t empowered by their victory. To the contrary. They were bloodied by it. In a sign of their weakening hold on member nations, the Palestinians and Jordanians felt compelled to send a threatening letter to the members of UNESCO＊s World Heritage Committee lest they dare to vote against the resolution. Powerful players don＊t make threats. They don＊t need to. Israel＊s experience at UNESCO teaches us that there are governments that are open to counteroffers. Israel doesn＊t need to hide in America＊s shadow. It is capable of working on its own to blunt the impact of the Palestinians＊ automatic majority. And it will need to use all of its resources to fend off a US-backed assault at the Security Council. Unlike UNESCO, the Security Council can pass legally binding resolutions. Israel needs to be prepared to bring all of its resources to bear to prevent such a resolution from being adopted against it. Obama＊s intention to abandon Israel at the Security Council means that Israel comes to this battle severely hobbled. But there is one advantage to the US＊s betrayal. Over the years, Israel＊s ability to trust the US to veto anti-Israel resolutions at the Security Council was been a mixed blessing. On the one hand, the US has secured Israel from diplomatic assaults. But on the other hand, our ability to trust Washington has made us diplomatically lazy and ineffective. Safe in Washington＊s shadow, we have behaved as through all diplomacy is public diplomacy. That is, we have pretended that statecraft begins and ends with making the moral or strategic case for our side against the other guys. But public diplomacy is just one diplomatic tool. The Syrian regime, for instance, has no moral case for securing international support. Bashar Assad didn＊t convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to support him by arguing that he is better than alternative regimes. He bought Putin＊s support by offering him permanent air and naval bases in Syria. Then there is Morocco, another weak state with no public diplomacy case to make. Last March, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon outraged Rabat when he acknowledged the plain fact that Western Sahara, which Morocco occupies, is ※occupied territory.§ Morocco quickly secured the support of Spain and France and launched an all-out onslaught against Ban. How did Morocco manage? Morocco＊s most powerful diplomatic resource is its control over migration flows from North Africa to Europe. Anytime it wishes, Rabat can open the migratory floodgates just as easily as it can keep them shut. And the French and Spanish know it. In less than a month, Ban issued repeated abject apologies. Game. Set. Match. Morocco. From reports to date, it appears that shortly after the US elections on November 8, the Malaysians or Egyptians will submit a Palestinian-backed resolution that defines Israeli communities in united Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria as illegal. If the resolution is brought to a vote, the US will fail to veto it. Such a resolution, or a resolution obligating Israel to withdraw to the 1949 armistice lines, would cause Israel grave harm. So what resources does Israel have to prevent this from happening? Of course, we have public diplomacy. And that might work with some friendly nations. But it won＊t get us over the top. We need to learn from the Syrian and Moroccan examples and consider what we have to offer Security Council members in exchange for their support in scuttling the approaching onslaught against us. One such resource is the US Congress. Israel＊s allies in Congress are sickened by the Obama administration＊s devastating Middle East policies. A solid majority of lawmakers can be trusted to support actions that will reinforce Israel＊s position. Israel has other resources as well that we can trade on. We have natural gas. And we have technologies that the governments of the world require to surmount the challenges of the 21 century. There is no reason to give these resources away when we can trade them for diplomatic support. As for the Palestinians, as the UNESCO vote showed, they are less popular now than at any time in the past 40 years. All they have to offer is threats and antisemitism. Both are powerful weapons. But they are no longer invincible. Israel＊s goal must be to use our resources at the Security Council in a manner that will make it impossible for Obama to enable an anti-Israel resolution to pass. A method for achieving this goal has two components. The first component is to convince a friendly country on the Security Council to propose a balanced resolution that would counter the Palestinian-backed Israel-bashing one. Such a resolution could include four points. First, it could deplore efforts to deny Jewish history in Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Second, it can condemn the PA/PLO for their continued unlawful funding of terrorists. Third, it can urge Israel to restrain settlement construction in areas that in previous negotiations have been identified as likely territory for a future Palestinian state. Fourth, it can call on Israel and the PA to reinstate negotiations immediately without preconditions. Israel has friendly ties with a few Security Council members, among them Uruguay and New Zealand. In the final weeks of the Obama era, it is possible that Israel will be able to convince one of them to submit a balanced resolution along these lines. Obama would be hard-pressed to oppose such a resolution in favor of one that singles Israel out for rebuke. But that still is insufficient. Obama can make Uruguay and New Zealand a better offer if he wishes. And so we move to the second aspect of the plan. If we learn nothing else from the Obama era, we must recognize that the time has come for Israel to stop sufficing with just one Security Council veto. Most states have several. And we need a few more. Russia today is the best place to start our search for a second veto. Putin is a dealmaker. As his agreement with Assad showed, he is willing to consider attractive offers. Obviously, Israel won＊t offer Russia bases. But we do have other things to offer Putin in exchange for a veto. For instance, in exchange for a Russian veto at the Security Council, Israel can offer Putin to lobby the US Congress to cancel US sanctions against Russia over Russia＊s annexation of Crimea. Israel has no dog in that fight. And the sanctions are not getting the US anywhere. Putin might go for the deal for two reasons. First, by stepping into the breach and defending Israel against Obama, he will humiliate Obama. Second, if Israel succeeds with the Congress, he will reap economic rewards. For his part, Putin wouldn＊t even have to openly side with Israel. All he would have to do is announce that in the interests of regional stability, Russia will not support an unbalanced resolution on Israel and the Palestinians. If Putin supports a balanced resolution, Obama will be checkmated. His plan to take revenge on Israel for not following him off the strategic cliff will be foiled. Israel will have survived his presidency. None of this will be easy. And success is far from assured. There are many more ways for Israel to fail than succeed. Our diplomatic weakness remains a millstone around our neck. But as the UNESCO resolutions showed, attacking Israel is no longer cost free. We are not powerless in the grip of circumstances. We have cards to play. And now is the time to play them for all they are worth.",english,2016-10-28T07:55:02.971+03:00,frontpagemag.com,US,34811,Checkmating Obama,0,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/barack_obama_with_benjamin_netanyahu_in_the_oval_office_5-18-09_2.jpg?itok=OagIot3x,0,1,0,0,0,hate,Neutral

October 31, 2016 
Originally published by the Gatestone Institute. Raymond Ibrahim is a Shillman Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. 
As the Muslim persecution of Christians continues to reach critical proportions around the world (see report below), the average American shows much more concern than the current administration. Soon after it was revealed that the Obama administration has taken in 5,435 Muslim refugees, but only 28 Christians〞even though Christians are approximately 10 percent of Syria＊s population and are classified as experiencing a genocide there〞a poll found that more than three quarters of American respondents agreed with the statement: ※It is important to me that the next US President be committed to addressing the persecution that some Christians face around the world (eg., imprisonment, beheadings, rape, loss of home and assets).§ 
The deliberate targeting and killing of Christians in Europe also reached unprecedented levels in modern times. Most notably, on the morning of July 26, ※ Allahu Akbar § shouting Muslims stormed a small church in France during morning mass. They forced 85-year-old Fr. Jacques Hamel to his knees, slit his throat, and ※ critically injured § a nun, before being killed by police. (It was later revealed that police had known that church was being targeted and had even been monitoring one of the murderers for at least one-and-a-half years.) 
Later, when a journalist asked Pope Francis if Fr. Jacques was ※ killed in the name of Islam ,§ the pope disagreed. He argued that he hears of Christians committing violence every day in Italy: ※this one who has murdered his girlfriend, another who has murdered the mother-in-law＃ and these are baptized Catholics! There are violent Catholics! If I speak of Islamic violence, I must speak of Catholic violence.§ The logic of the pope＊s statement seems to be that violence done in direct contradiction of the Judeo-Christian God＊s commandments〞such as the murder of wives and mothers-in-law〞is identical to violence done in accordance with Allah＊s commandments to wage jihad on ※infidels.§ 
In ISIS-controlled territories in Iraq and Syria, reports of Christians being tortured to convert, maimed, crucified, burned alive, beheaded, or sold into sex slavery continued to emerge. In Iraq, a report says that ※Christians and other minorities in Iraq are facing persecution at unprecedented levels and are at the verge of extinction ＃. The Christian population has dwindled from 1.4 million to 300,000 in the last decade, according to some estimates. However, Minority Rights Group put that the number at anywhere between 50,000 to 250,000.§ 
A former ISIS member exposed some of the atrocities the group commits in Syria. ※They were extremely brutal, killing women and the elderly who did not obey them. They abused and mutilated their dead bodies. They cut up the corpses, tied them to the back of the cars and dragged them along. They would find them and publicly execute them. I witnessed many executions.§ 
The remainder of July＊s roundup of Muslim persecution of Christians〞most of which was not committed by ISIS〞includes, but is not limited to, the following: Muslim Slaughter of Christians 
Nigeria : Two armed Muslim tribesmen murdered Rev. Joseph Kurah, an evangelical pastor, while he was working on his farm. They repeatedly hacked him to death with machetes. A local Muslim reportedly hired the assassins after he got into an argument with the Christian leader. Since 2001, Muslim Fulani have murdered thousands of Christians and destroyed hundreds of churches. According to a separate report , in just June and July, Muslim Fulani tribesmen targeted and invaded several Christian majority villages. They killed 133 people, destroyed 76 churches, and countless Christian properties and farms. Muslims hacked a female Christian preacher to death in the outskirts of Abuja. Eunice Elisha, a minister from the Redeemed Church of God, was found dead in a pool of her own blood after she went out to preach in the streets. A month earlier, on June 2, a Muslim mob beat Bridget Agbahime, the wife of a Christian pastor, to death with iron rods on the accusation that she blasphemed against Muhammad. About one million Christian children whose families have been displaced or affected by the violent activities of Boko Haram and Muslim Fulani herdsmen are starving. Churches, which are currently the primary supporters of these children, have gone beyond capacity and tens of thousands of children are expected to die of starvation and disease if they do not receive aid from elsewhere. According to the report, Boko Haram＊s seven-year rebellion has left 20,000 people dead and more than two million displaced. 
Philippines : Attacks and murders of Christians around Mindanao Island, which has a large Muslim population, are on the rise. Fr. Sebastiano D'Ambra, who has lived in the region for 40 years, is calling on authorities to ※find proper solutions§ to stop ※the agony of the Christian community.§ He said, ※A Christian was killed in Jolo a few days ago. A reliable source told me that 20 Christians have been targeted to be killed or kidnapped soon＃. the Christian community is suffering a form of persecution from those who are guided by bad elements who claim to do it in the name of Islam.§ 
Kenya : Muslim gunmen from Al Shabaab murdered Pastor John as he was returning home from facilitating a peacemaking training seminar. The jihadis ambushed the bus he was in killing the pastor and six other people including children. 
Democratic Republic of Congo : Suspected Muslim militants armed with guns and machetes slaughtered nine Christians in the North Kivu region. They also looted homes, seizing food and cattle as plunder. The area, which is 96 percent Christian, has seen more than 1,100 killed over the last year and a half. 
Pakistan : The 2013 Muslim bombing of the All Saints Church in Peshawar, which killed more than 100 Christian worshippers, claimed its latest victim . After battling internal injuries she had received three years earlier from the attack, Cecilia, a 42-year-old Christian nurse, died from bomb fragments embedded in her body that had turned cancerous. According to the report, ※With tearstained eyes,§ her husband noted that ※We are still losing loved ones [after the attack]. Forced Conversion, Rape and Murder of Christians 
Libya : A report documents the sufferings that Christians experience at the hands Muslim militants when they migrate through Libya in an effort to reach Europe. In one instance 11 women were abducted and kept as sex slaves underground and repeatedly raped by various jihadis for almost a year. One of the Christian women, Amal, 21, said: ※They took [the Christians] to Tripoli and kept us underground 每 we didn't see the sun for nine months＃. Sometimes we didn't eat for three days. Other times they would give us one meal a day, half a piece of bread.§ The Christian woman described how they were pressured into converting to Islam under threat of death and beaten with hoses or sticks. ※Sometimes they would frighten us with their guns, or threaten to slaughter us with their knives.§ 
Islamic State : ISIS has been making use of social media〞including Facebook, and mobile apps like WhatAPP, and Telegram〞 to sell enslaved Christian and Yazidi girls to a wider network of sadists and pedophiles. One Telegram posting showed a picture of a young girl with the caption: ※Virgin. Beautiful. 12 years old,§ the posting states. ※Her price has reached $12,500 and she will be sold soon.§ 
Nigeria: Another report says that the Muslim terrorist group, Boko Haram, has murdered 466 people, almost all of whom were Christian, for refusing to convert to Islam; they also forced 218 women and young girls to ※marry§ their fighters. 
Pakistan : Muslims kidnapped and forced a 14-year-old Christian girl to convert to Islam last May. Her father pled with them for weeks to release his daughter. They eventually pretended to relent, told him to meet them somewhere so they could return his daughter, and, once he arrived, shot him dead . The girl remains with the rapists, the slain father＊s widow and three other daughters are hiding in their home in fear of further reprisals from the kidnappers. According to Najma Bibi, the girl＊s mother: ※several months after my daughter's kidnapping, the police have not done anything because we have no money to defend our rights. We live in a hopeless situation, we need help. I pray that my daughter will continue to place hope and faith in Jesus Christ.§ Muhammad Iqrar, a Muslim man, assaulted and raped Sonia Nasar, a 16-year-old Christian girl. Although the rapist fled when her father rushed to the scene after hearing the cries of his daughter, Sonia was left in ※critical condition.§ He said that he expects no justice or follow up from local authorities, some of whom are associated with the rapist. Sobia Nadeem, a Christian girl studying for a Master＊s degree in physics, was abducted by a group of Muslims, forced to convert to Islam, and forced to marry〞at gunpoint〞a man named Mohammad Hamza in Lahore. Although the girl managed to escape back to her parents＊ home, she was taken to court where her family had to prove that her conversion and marriage were performed under force. Numerous reports continued to appear indicating that non-Muslim students, most often Christians, are being forced to convert to Islam through the public school system. Teachers force them to recite the shahada〞which when said before Muslim witnesses makes the reciter a Muslim〞and force them to study Muslim beliefs and practices. This often occurs in conjunction with denigration of the Christian faith. Due to ongoing Christian protests, the Punjab government said it would launch an inquiry. Muslim Attacks on Christian Churches and Symbols 
Turkey : During the July 15 failed coup attempt, at least two churches were attacked . ※One of the attacks happened in Trabzon. A group of 10 people attacked Santa Maria Church with paving stones and hammers to smash the windows§ said the report. One church leader in Istanbul said, ※I'm not optimistic about the plight of Christians in Turkey. Bear in mind we've had a Roman Catholic Bishop murdered, we've had clergy threatened, we've had one priest murdered 10 years ago. Any Christian leader, if they're being honest, would say that some of what's going on is quite alarming.§ 
Nigeria : On Friday, July 15, Muslims attacked a Catholic church. They were angered that Christians were praying in the church on Friday, Islam＊s ※holy day,§ when Muslims congregate and pray in mosques. According to a Christian church leader, ※Sometime around 2pm, some Muslim youths in their hundreds left their mosque after their Friday Jumat prayer and rushed to the church premises, climbed the wall and destroyed everything in the church: the windows, the altar, musical instruments, the chapel. The security man in the church premises was beaten to a pulp. Some women holding a prayer meeting were chased away. The seminarian, who is resident in the premises, was also beaten up and chased away.§ 
Iraq : According to a new report , ※All 45 churches and monasteries inside Mosul are reportedly now occupied by ISIS, who have looted, burned and destroyed property, in addition to removing the building's crosses."" Christians unable to flee are forced to pay large extortion money (jizya) or risk instant execution. 
Sudan : A report notes that by continuously bombing Christian and non-Muslim indigenous regions near South Sudan, and targeting churches and pastors＊ homes for destruction, the government is trying to ※cleanse§ the nation of Christians and create a homogenous Muslim state. In recent years, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by the violence, their homes, crops, churches, schools and hospitals destroyed. 
Indonesia : Despite receiving all legal documents and permits, a Catholic family trying to construct a shrine to the Virgin Mary on their own land since 2009 continued to face growing threats from local Muslims. In 2012, a Muslim mob set fire to the shrine site and brought construction to a halt. Most recently in July, Muslims stormed the house of a Catholic leader and ordered him to stop the work, even though he has a building permit issued by the authorities. Muslim Attacks on Christian Apostates, Blasphemers, and Preachers 
Egypt : According to a report , ※Just like the biblical character Daniel in the lions' den, an Egyptian Muslim who converted to Christianity found himself at the mercy of ferocious attack dogs that were unleashed by his jailers to torture and possibly kill him. However, law student Majed El Shafie had God on his side and, just like in the story about Daniel, the savage animals miraculously did not harm him〞to the utter astonishment of his prison guards.§ He was, however, tortured by the Muslim guards themselves. 
Uganda : Another Muslim convert to Christianity has lost his family, home, and business, and now lives in a small shanty. As a result of his apostasy, the extended family of the 53-year-old man, a former Muslim imam, stormed and eventually appropriated his ancestral home in an attempt on his life. Of that night, he said: ※I heard people talking outside my house around 8 p.m., saying that they wanted to take away my life and, ＆We cannot watch the whole family turning to Christianity.＊§ He complained to the local council after his relatives also destroyed his business, but their intervention had no effect and he now lives without any means to provide for himself. 
Pakistan : Nadeem James, a 27-year-old Christian man and father of two, was arrested in Gujarat district after a Muslim angry with him accused James of texting a poem deemed ※blasphemous§ of Muhammad. According to the accused＊s brother: ※We were not at home when the police raided our house to arrest Nadeem. However, when the cops couldn＊t find any of us in the premises, they took away two women of the family 每 my wife and the wife of my elder brother, Faryad.§ Around the same time, local mosques began calling on megaphones that if he didn＊t surrender himself, Christian homes would burn. Nadeem surrendered himself and the women were released. ※The charge against my brother is completely baseless. Nadeem is uneducated and could not have possibly sent that text message. I＊m certain that Yasir Bashir [Muslim accuser] downloaded the supposedly blasphemous text onto Nadeem＊s phone and then forwarded it to his cell number to build a case against my brother.§ Yaqoob Masih, 56, a Christian sanitary worker, was accused of committing blasphemy against Islam in Hyderabad. According to the report, ※Masih collected waste from the streets and dumped it at a specific [location], however Bakash [Muslim accuser], without verifying, tortured Masih with a stick, accusing him [of] committing blasphemy by burning pages of a book which [reportedly] carried Islamic verses. Masih was packing the garbage and waste in a trunk when Bakash accused him [of] blasphemy.§ Masih was hospitalized from his injuries. A Muslim doctor who treated a dying Christian man with medicine that was donated through zakat, Islamic charity, received death threats . The Christian was on the verge of dying without treatment. In his defense, the Muslim doctor said he did not know the man was a Christian, or that it was against some interpretations of Islamic law to use Muslim charity money to help non-Muslims. 
Iran : Three Azerbaijani pastors were arrested in Tehran during a visit. No reason was given to family and local legal experts. According to the report, ※This is the latest in a succession of pastors who have been imprisoned by Iranian authorities over many years for accusations ranging from apostasy to evangelism.§ And Ebrahim Firouzi, who has been under arrest since 2013 under vague charges 
※suffered physical abuse at the hands of prison guards when he was forced to attend an appeal hearing.§ Dhimmitude: Muslim Contempt and Hostility for Christians 
Bangladesh : Christian and Hindu businesses received notices from a banned Islamic organization ordering them to uphold a number of Islamic customs or be killed. These include hanging banners with Allah＊s name, keeping copies of the Koran, putting pictures of the Kaba in Mecca, removing pictures or statues of their own religions, creating a place for Muslims to pray, and banning music and female workers. 
Pakistan : The government in the Raiwind district flooded a Christian graveyard with sewage water and desecrated all the graves. In response, protesting Christians complained that even in the grave they can receive no peace in Pakistan. 
Sudan : Authorities insulted, forcefully arrested and jailed 14 Christians when they attempted to stop them from seizing an evangelical school on church property, which authorities plan on giving to Muslim businesses. Later, authorities returned to the same Christian school, gave letters of dismissal to the Christian headmistress, vandalized her office, and replaced her with a teacher of their own choosing. 
Egypt : After a Christian man was stabbed to death and many Christian homes and a church burned by angry Muslims because of a rumor that a church was going to be built, Coptic Christian Bishop Makarious of al-Minya was interviewed on television. Church authorities in Egypt are regularly diplomatic and sensitive to what they say, but Makarious made many revealing comments. Although only Christians, no Muslims, were killed and hurt, he wondered why the government and media continue to describe these incidents as ※clashes§〞which suggests two quarrelling parties〞when the reality is always that one side attacks the other: ※Within minutes [of the start of one of the attacks], 100 Muslims instantly appeared, fully armed, as if ready for war.§ He added: ※As long as the attackers are never punished, and the armed forces are portrayed as doing their duty, this will just encourage others to continue the attacks, since, even if they are arrested, they will be quickly released.§ When the host asked questions about who is released and why, suggesting that perhaps those released are in fact innocent of any wrongdoing against the Christians, the bishop replied: ※Well what do you think when the actual attackers themselves are arrested, with complete proofs and evidences against them, but then they are still declared innocent and released?＃ this happens every single time.§ About this Series 
The persecution of Christians in the Islamic world has become endemic. Accordingly, ※Muslim Persecution of Christians§ was developed to collate some〞by no means all〞of the instances of persecution that surface each month. It serves two purposes: 
1) To document that which the mainstream media does not: the habitual, if not chronic, persecution of Christians. 
2) To show that such persecution is not ※random,§ but systematic and interrelated〞that it is rooted in a worldview inspired by Islamic Sharia. 
Accordingly, whatever the anecdote of persecution, it typically fits under a specific theme, including hatred for churches and other Christian symbols; apostasy, blasphemy, and proselytism laws that criminalize and sometimes punish with death those who ※offend§ Islam; sexual abuse of Christian women; forced conversions to Islam; theft and plunder in lieu of jizya (financial tribute expected from non-Muslims); overall expectations for Christians to behave like cowed dhimmis , or third-class, ※tolerated§ citizens; and simple violence and murder. Sometimes it is a combination thereof. 
Because these accounts of persecution span different ethnicities, languages, and locales〞from Morocco in the West, to Indonesia in the East〞it should be clear that one thing alone binds them: Islam〞whether the strict application of Islamic Sharia law, or the supremacist culture born of it.

Is a war in the making 〞 a third world war? 
If there is much talk about such a possibility, it is mainly because of the tensions between the United States and Russia. Tensions between the two most powerful nuclear states in the world have never been this high since the end of the Cold War in 1989 and the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991. 
There are at least two flash points, one more dangerous than the other. In Eastern Ukraine, Russian backed rebels will not surrender to the US supported regime in Kiev because they see US control over Ukraine as part of a much larger agenda to expand NATO power to the very borders of Russia. This has been happening for some years now. 
But it is the Washington-Moscow confrontation in Allepo, Syria which portends to a huge conflagration. The US is protective of major militant groups such as Al-Nusra which has besieged Eastern Allepo and is seeking to overthrow the Bashar al-Assad government. Washington has also set its sight on ＆regime change＊ in Damascus ever since the latter＊s determined resistance to Israeli occupation of the strategic Golan Heights in Syria from 1967 onwards. The drive for regime change intensified with the US-Israeli quest for a ※new Middle East§ following the Anglo-American invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003. It became more pronounced in 2009 when Bashar al-Assad rejected a proposal to allow a gas pipe-line from Qatar to Europe to pass through his country, a pipe-line which would have reduced Europe＊s dependence upon Russia for gas. Russia of course has been a long-standing ally of Syria. Together with Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah, it is helping the Syrian government to break the siege of Eastern Allepo and to defeat militants in other parts of Syria. 
It is obvious that in both instances, in Ukraine and Syria, the US has not been able to achieve what it wants. The US has also been stymied in Southeast Asia where its attempt to re-assert its power through its 2010 ＆Pivot to Asia＊ policy has suffered a serious setback as a result of the decision of the new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, to pursue an independent foreign policy that no longer adheres blindly to US interests. At the same time, China continues to expand and enhance its economic strength in Asia and the world through its One Belt One Road (OBOR) projects and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and via its leadership of BRICS. China＊s regional and global economic role is leading to its pronounced presence in security and military matters. As a result of all this, the US＊s imperial power has clearly diminished. It is a hegemon in decline. Source of image: lhvnews.com 
It is because it is not prepared to accept its decline that some US generals are threatening to demonstrate US＊s military might. If a hegemon is a danger to humankind when it is at its pinnacle, it becomes an even greater threat to peace when its power is diminishing. Like a wounded tiger, it becomes even more furious and ferocious. A new US president may be inclined to give vent to this frustration through an arrogant display of military power. 
How can we check such wanton arrogance? There will be elements in the elite stratum of US society itself who would be opposed to the US going to war. We saw a bit of this in 2013 when those who were itching to launch military strikes against Syria based upon dubious ※evidence§ of the government＊s use of chemical weapons were thwarted by others with a saner view of the consequences of war. It is also important to observe that none of the US＊s major allies in Europe wants a war. Burdened by severe challenges related to the economy and migration, the governments know that their citizens will reject any move towards war either on the borders of Russia or in Syria and West Asia. 
This also suggests that a self-absorbed European citizenry may not have the enthusiasm to mobilise against an imminent war. Let us not forget that it was in European cities from London to Berlin that the biggest demonstrations against the war in Iraq took place in 2003. Anti-war protests will have to be initiated elsewhere this time. 
Governments in Moscow and Beijing, in Tehran and Jakarta, in Pretoria and La Paz, should come out openly against war. They should encourage other governments in the Global South and the Global North to denounce any move towards a war that will engulf the whole of humanity. Citizens all over the world should condemn war through a variety of strategies ranging from signature campaigns and letters to the media to public rallies and street demonstrations. 
In this campaign against an imminent war, the media, both conventional and alternative, will have a huge role to play. It is unfortunate that well-known media outlets in the West have supported war in the past. It is time that they atone for their sins!",english,2016-11-01T18:52:29.537+02:00,geoengineeringwatch.org,US,,Is A War In The Making 〞 A Third World War?

And talk about choosing his venue with aplomb; right in the heart of the Rising Dragon, no less. 
Capping his state visit to Beijing, Duterte then coined the mantra 每 pregnant with overtones 每 that will keep ringing all across the global South; ※America has lost.§ 
And if that was not enough, he announced a new alliance 每 Philippines, China and Russia 每 is about to emerge; ※there are three of us against the world.§ 
Predictably, the Beltway establishment in the ※indispensable nation§ went bananas, reacting as ※puzzled§ or in outright anger, dispersing the usual expletives on the ※crude populist§, ※unhinged leader§. 
The bottom line is that it takes a lot of balls for the leader of a poor, developing country, in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, to openly defy the hyperpower. Yet what Duterte is gaming at is pure realpolitik; if he prevails, he will be able to deftly play the US against China to the benefit of Filipino interests. 
※The springtime of our relationship§ 
It did start with a bang; during Duterte＊s China visit, Manila inked no less than $13 billion in deals with Beijing 每 from trade and investment to drug control, maritime security and infrastructure. 
Beijing pulled out all stops to make Duterte feel welcomed. 
President Xi Jinping suggested Manila and Beijing should ※temporarily put aside§ the intractable South China Sea disputes and learn from the ※political wisdom§ of history 每 as in give space to diplomatic talks. After all, the two peoples were ※blood-linked brothers.§ 
Duterte replied in kind; ※Even as we arrive in Beijing close to winter, this is the springtime of our relationship,§ he told Xi at the Great Hall of the People. 
China is already the Philippines＊ second-largest trade partner, behind Japan, the US and Singapore. Filipino exports to these three are at roughly 42.7 percent of the total, compared to 22.1 to China/Hong Kong. Imports from China are roughly 16.1 percent of the total. Even as trade with China is bound to rise, what really matters for Duterte is massive Chinese infrastructure investment. 
What this will mean in practice is indeed ground-breaking; the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) will definitely be involved in Philippine economic development; Manila will be more involved in promoting smooth China-ASEAN relations in all sorts of regional issues (it takes the rotating chair of ASEAN in 2017); and the Philippines will be more integrated in the New Silk Roads, a.k.a. One Belt, One Road (OBOR). 
Three strikes; no wonder the US is out. And there＊s even a fourth strike, embedded in Duterte＊s promise that he will soon end military cooperation with the US, despite the opposition of part of the Filipino armed forces. 
Watch the First Island Chain 
The build-up had already been dramatic enough. On the eve of his meeting with Xi, talking to members of the Filipino community in Beijing, Duterte said, ※it＊s time to say goodbye§ to the US; ※I will not ask but if they (the Chinese) offer and if they＊ll ask me, do you need this aid? [I will say] Of course, we are very poor.§ 
Then the clincher; ※I will not go to America anymore ＃ We will just be insulted there.§ Naval Base Subic Bay was a major ship-repair, supply, and rest and recreation facility of the Spanish Navy and subsequently the United States Navy located in Olongapo, Zambales, Philippines. The base was 262 square miles, about the size of Singapore. It was finally turned over to the Filipino government in 1992. 
The US was the colonial power in the Philippines from 1899 to 1942. Hollywood permeates the collective unconscious. English is the lingua franca 每 side by side with tagalog. But the tentacles of Uncle Sam＊s ※protection§ racket are not exactly welcomed. Two of the largest components of the US Empire of Bases were located for decades in the Philippines; Clark Air Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Base. 
Clark, occupying 230 square miles, with 15,000 people, was busy to death during the Vietnam War 每 the main hub for men and hardware in and out of Saigon. Then it turned into one of those Pentagon ※forward operating§ HQs. Subic, occupying 260 square miles, was as busy as Clark. It was the forward operating base for the US 7th Fleet. 
Already in 1987, before the end of the Cold War, the RAND corporation was alarmed by the loss of both bases; that would be ※devastating for regional security§. Devastating§ in the 每 mythical 每 sense of ※defending the interests of ASEAN§ and the ※security of the sea-lanes§. 
Translation; the Pentagon and the US Navy would lose a key instrument of pressure over ASEAN, as protecting the ※security of the sea-lanes§ was always the key justification for those bases. 
And lose they eventually did; Clark was closed down in November 1991, and Subic in November 1992. 
It took years for China to sense an opening 每 and profit from it; after all during the 1990s and the early 2000s, the absolute priority was breakneck speed internal development. But then Beijing did the math; no more US bases opened untold vistas as far as the First Island Chain is concerned. 
The First Island Chain is a product, over millennia, of the fabulous tectonic forces of the Ring of Fire; a chain of islands running from southern Japan in the north to Borneo in the south. For Beijing, they work as a sort of shield for the Chinese eastern seaboard; if this chain is secure, Asia is secure. 
For all practical purposes, Beijing considers the First Island Chain as a non-negotiable Western Pacific demarcation zone 每 ideally with no foreign (as in US) interference. The South China Sea 每 which in parts is characterized by Manila as the Western Philippine Sea 每 is inside the First Island Chain. So to really secure the First Island Chain, the South China Sea must be free of foreign interference. 
And here we are plunged at the heart of arguably the key 21st century hotspot in Asian geopolitics 每 the main reason for the Obama administration＊s pivot to Asia. 
The US Navy so far counted on the Philippines to oppose the proverbial, hyped up ※Chinese aggression§ in the South China and East China seas. The neocon/neoliberalcon industrial-military complex fury against ※unhinged§ Duterte＊s game-changer is that containing China and ruling over the First Island Chain has been at the core of US naval strategy since the beginning of the Cold War. 
Beijing, meanwhile, will have all the time needed to polish its strategic environment. This has nothing to do with ※freedom of navigation§ and protecting sea-lanes; everyone needs South China Sea cross-trade. It＊s all about China 每 perhaps within the next ten years 每 being able to deny ※access§ to the US Navy in the South China Sea and inside the First Island Chain. 
Duterte＊s game-changing ※America has lost§ is just a new salvo in arguably the key 21st century geopolitical thriller. A Supreme Court justice in Manila, for instance, has warned Duterte that, were he to give up sovereignty over the Scarborough Shoal, he could be impeached. That won＊t happen; Duterte wants loads of Chinese trade and investment, not abdicate from sovereignty. He＊d rather be ready to confront being demonized by the hyperpower as much as the late Hugo Chavez was in his heyday.

9f5ec2590ab3f125df63bd305952b1b525a84fef,0,shorty,2016-10-29T02:48:19.691+03:00,It＊s On: Between Duterte and America,"shorty BY PETER LEE I ＊ve written a couple pieces of the smoking hot issue in Pivotland, Philippine president Duterte＊s swerve toward a pro-PRC foreign policy, and what the U.S. and pro-American sector of the Manila elite are going to do about it. The first piece, Reports of death of US-Philippine alliance may be exaggerated, addresses the fact that Duterte＊s freedom of movement is constrained by the need to keep the Philippine military happy, and notes that ex-prez and retired general Fidel Ramos, who facilitated Duterte＊s entrance on the national political stage, is signaling dissatisfaction with Duterte. The second piece, Duterte Plays the ＆Mamasapano＊ Card, covers a Duterte counter-attack: a threat to relitigate the death of 44 Philippine National Police commandos at Mamasapano in Mindanao, a 2014 special ops fiasco conducted under the aegis of the United States which a) exposes ex-president Aquino to serious legal jeopardy b) posits that the US alliance is doing a better job of killing Filipinos than the PRC can ever hope to do. The US seems to be embedded in a colonial mindset when it comes to the Philippines, something along the lines of ※we＊ve been selflessly looking after the Philippines for a century, and that thug Duterte won＊t be allowed to screw that up during his brief (maybe curtailed) presidency.§ It takes a pretty superficial view of Philippine history, one that accepts the US self-definition as the Philippines＊ security savior while ignoring the distortions and shortcomings of the colonial and neo-colonial relationship. For me this tunnel vision was typified by the US media crowing over the formal delivery of a refurbished C-130 transport to the Philippine government by outgoing ambo Philip Goldberg. Message: here＊s the US making provisions for Philippine defense at the same time Duterte＊s selling out the country to China. To me, the inadvertent message was 1) here＊s the US blindly stroking the pivot fetish while Duterte tries to solve the Mindanao insurgency that has cost at least 400,000 lives over the last century, win his drug war, and find a place for the Philippines in Asia that doesn＊t give primacy to the US preoccupation confronting the PRC and 2) the U.S., in my opinion, pretty much has a policy of keeping the Philippines flat on its behind as an independent military force by trickling out second-hand gear to the Philippine military while the sweet stuff is dangled in front of it during US joint military maneuvers and port calls. But the United States is trying to find political leverage wherever it can and the Western media will, I＊m sure, put its shoulder to the wheel to help out. Feelings of nationalism are pervasive in the US, but Americans have difficulty understanding why people in other nations may harbor animosity toward them on account of their colonialist and imperialist experiences. P hilip Goldberg sat down for a 45-minute exit interview with Rappler. As befitting Rappler＊s origins in the Soros/Omidyar network of pro-US globalization advocacy, the interview was a stream of softballs about what to do about Duterte＊s disregard of the awesomeness of the American relationship, an awesomeness that is acknowledged by virtually all Filipinos who inexplicably (and, if the US has anything to do about it, temporarily) at the same time give Duterte approval ratings of over 80%. It＊s worth watching if you have the patience. Goldberg is a smooth cat, and the Rappler tonguebath gives you no inkling of the fact that he intimately familiar with the wet work of end-arounding national governments to cultivate secessionist movements, you know, like what he did in Bolivia (declared persona non grata as a result) and Kosovo, and like that thing in Duterte＊s home province of Mindanao, which in my opinion probably the main reason why Duterte wanted him out of the Philippines. Goldberg also discretely plays the economic threat card, concern-trolling that anti-US attitudes will dismay ※foreign investors§. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in subsequent weeks. As far as I can tell, the biggest U.S. factor in the domestic Philippine economy is the call-center industry. I doubt US corporations are interested in actually pulling their operations out and subjecting them to the English-language mercies of India, but certainly a call from the State Department or White House would convince them of the wisdom of at least making the threat. And I also wonder if expected President Hillary Clinton will find it necessary to drop the hammer on Duterte, in order to demonstrate to a rather dubious Asia that there is no alternative to loyalty to the pivot. I expect the next few months, in other words, to be very interesting.

Moscow-Beijing Express on The Saker 161029,"Nuclear weapons In fact, Russia is not about to go to war with America. Much of its language is no more than bluster. But it does pose a threat to stability and order. And the first step to answering that threat is to understand that Russian belligerence is not a sign of resurgence, but of a chronic, debilitating weakness. Vlad the invader As our special report this week sets out, Russia confronts grave problems in its economy, politics and society. Its population is ageing and is expected to shrink by 10% by 2050. An attempt to use the windfall from the commodity boom to modernise the state and its economy fell flat. Instead Mr Putin has presided over a huge increase in government: between 2005 and 2015, the share of Russian GDP that comes from public spending and state-controlled firms rose from 35% to 70%. Having grown by 7% a year at the start of Mr Putin＊s reign, the economy is now shrinking. Sanctions are partly to blame, but corruption and a fall in the price of oil matter more. The Kremlin decides who gets rich and stays that way. Vladimir Yevtushenkov, a Russian tycoon, was detained for three months in 2014. When he emerged, he had surrendered his oil company. Mr Putin has sought to offset vulnerability at home with aggression abroad. With their mass protests after election-rigging in 2011-12, Russia＊s sophisticated urban middle classes showed that they yearn for a modern state. When the oil price was high, Mr Putin could resist them by buying support. Now he shores up his power by waging foreign wars and using his propaganda tools to whip up nationalism. He is wary of giving any ground to Western ideas because Russia＊s political system, though adept at repression, is brittle. Institutions that would underpin a prosperous Russia, such as the rule of law, free media, democracy and open competition, pose an existential threat to Mr Putin＊s rotten state. For much of his time in office Mr Obama has assumed that, because Russia is a declining power, he need not pay it much heed. Yet a weak, insecure, unpredictable country with nuclear weapons is dangerous〞more so, in some ways, even than the Soviet Union was. Unlike Soviet leaders after Stalin, Mr Putin rules alone, unchecked by a Politburo or by having witnessed the second world war＊s devastation. He could remain in charge for years to come. Age is unlikely to mellow him. Mr Obama increasingly says the right things about Putinism〞he sounded reasonably tough during a press conference this week〞but Mr Putin has learned that he can defy America and come out on top. Mild Western sanctions make ordinary Russians worse off, but they also give the people an enemy to unite against, and Mr Putin something to blame for the economic damage caused by his own policies. Ivan the bearable What should the West do? Time is on its side. A declining power needs containing until it is eventually overrun by its own contradictions〞even as the urge to lash out remains. Because the danger is of miscalculation and unchecked escalation, America must continue to engage in direct talks with Mr Putin even, as today, when the experience is dispiriting. Success is not measured by breakthroughs and ceasefires〞welcome as those would be in a country as benighted as Syria〞but by lowering the chances of a Russian blunder. Nuclear miscalculation would be the worst kind of all. Hence the talks need to include nuclear-arms control as well as improved military-to-military relations, in the hope that nuclear weapons can be kept separate from other issues, as they were in Soviet times. That will be hard because, as Russia declines, it will see its nuclear arsenal as an enduring advantage. Another area of dispute will be Russia＊s near abroad. Ukraine shows how Mr Putin seeks to destabilise countries as a way to stop them drifting out of Russia＊s orbit (see article ). America＊s next president must declare that, contrary to what Mr Trump has said, if Russia uses such tactics against a NATO member, such as Latvia or Estonia, the alliance will treat it as an attack on them all. Separately the West needs to make it clear that, if Russia engages in large-scale aggression against non-NATO allies, such as Georgia and Ukraine, it reserves the right to arm them. Above all the West needs to keep its head. Russian interference in America＊s presidential election merits measured retaliation. But the West can withstand such ※active measures§. Russia does not pretend to offer the world an attractive ideology or vision. Instead its propaganda aims to discredit and erode universal liberal values by nurturing the idea that the West is just as corrupt as Russia, and that its political system is just as rigged. It wants to create a divided West that has lost faith in its ability to shape the world. In response, the West should be united and firm.

A recent cover and main article in the Economist , pictured above, reminds me of just how hyperbolic and ideological is the West＊s propaganda against Russian President Vladimir Putin. While maybe good polemical fodder as a cartoon on the editorial page, the fact that this demonic caricature merits front cover status, indicates just how programmed and institutionalized Western mainstream media is. Westerners love to insult the Anti-West press for being ※party organs§ and ※government mouthpieces§. But, why travel so far? They only need to stay home with their national New York Times, Radio France and BBC , to really appreciate Bernaysian psyops being passed off as serious journalism (as in Edward Bernays). I don＊t call it living behind the Great Western Firewall for nothing. 
I have a friend whose email signature is ※Blame it on Putin§. For a while, he changed it to ※Blame it on China§. But that didn＊t last long and he recently changed it back. As we have seen with the most depressing predictability, President Putin, specifically, and Russia in general are the voodoo pin dolls of Western racism and demonization of another people (Slavs) and other religions (Orthodox Christianity, as well as widespread Islam and Buddhism in Siberia). http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2015/10/01/slavs-and-the-yellow-peril-are-niggers-brutes-and-beasts-in-the-eyes-of-western-empire-the-saker-44-days-radio-sinoland-2015-10-1/ 
What is so remarkable is how unhinged and psychopathic the West＊s racist propaganda is against Putin & Co., compared to the attacks on China＊s President Xi Jinping (XJP) and the Chinese people. It transgresses irrational fear, to the point of being sick, black humor. Yet, about the most polemical front cover against XJP was Time magazine in April, 2016, seen below. Making China＊s leader look like a Mao Zedong- Blade Runner replicant is tame and almost quaint, compared to the Orwellian ※Emmanuel Goldstein§ tsunami being launched nonstop against Putin. 

Pretty tame stuff, this, compared to the racist feeding frenzy that Western propaganda is ginning up against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Slavic countrymen. 
True, Russia has the longest border with what in now considered ※Europe§, and there is tremendous historical Western precedence to keep Germany from forming any kind of economic or geopolitical alliance with Russia. As well, the West＊s Ukrainian color revolution turned out to be a total genocidal failure, with Russia reintegrating Crimea and Donbass biding its time for a hopeful remarriage in the years to come. Needless to say, the revenge factor, and if there is anything that Western tyranny loves more, it＊s to avenge its long list of failed chaos and extermination around the world. 
But, Russia is officially a capitalist country. Its current constitution was largely written by American fifth columnists. The Russian Central Bank is widely presumed to be under the thumb of the West＊s oil banking families. In spite of widespread ignorance around the world, on these two counts, China can definitely list itself in the opposing column. http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2016/10/18/so-called-communist-china-an-exclusive-article-for-the-all-china-review-16-10-17/ . Given America＊s post-1917, deranged, hysterical fear of, and untold billions spent to crush any communist expression at home and around the world, you would think that red China and Xi would be Public Enemy Number One. But no, it＊s Putin and the Russians. 
One factor might be Western perceptions of Russia＊s and China＊s military strength. Russians have shown off their powerful, well-run army, navy and air force in Syria and the Black Sea. The West is probably in a bit of an historic rut, when looking at China＊s rapidly modernizing People＊s Liberation Army (PLA), like back to the Korean War, when the just liberated New China had no air force, no navy and no nuclear missiles, yet still kicked the pants off Uncle Sam, using mostly World War I vintage arms. But then again, nobody in the West will ever admit that they lost the Korean War in the first place. http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2016/09/04/from-may-9th-in-moscow-to-september-3rd-in-beijing-the-anti-west-order-comes-full-circle-reprint/ . I can tell you that here in China, just like 1950-1953, XJP and the PLA do not fear American military power, not one iota. Respect it, yes. Fear it, never. President Xi has put the PLA on combat ready war footing and he means it. http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/966932.shtml 
But there is a new gadfly in America＊s imperial ointment, one who may push President Xi and the Chinese people up the racist hate-o-meter, to Slavic levels, and that menace is the Philippines＊ new president, Rodrigo Duterte. http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2016/09/17/puppet-japan-saves-uncle-sams-face-in-south-china-sea-after-philippines-principled-stand-vs-imperialism-jeff-j-brown-on-press-tv/ . This plainspoken, no bullshit world leader is Uncle Sam＊s worst nightmare. He is calling American empire what it is: genocidal, dictatorial and rapacious. Not once, but day after day, meeting after meeting, press conference after press conference. 
At September 8-9, 2016＊s ASEAN summit in Laos, Duterte showed a colonial era photo and talked about the genocide that the US committed, as it brutally conquered the Philippines, 1899-1913, killing an estimated 1.25 million people, about 25% of the nation＊s population. Western media censored it like the plague (they have been anyway, for over a century) and even semi-friendly outlets like the South China Morning Post were aghast that he actually associated the West with genocide. Heaven forbid! This, in spite of the fact the easily 80-90% of history＊s genocides and exterminations were and are being perpetrated by Eurangloland, including of course Israel. Behind the Great Western Firewall, genocide is exclusively reserved for powerless, dark skinned people and unrepentant socialists, like Serbia＊s framed and destroyed Slobodan Milosevic. President Rodrigo Duterte shows images of the Bud Dajo massacre during his speech at the 2016 Metrobank Foundation＊s Outstanding Filipinos awarding ceremony in Malaca?an＊s Rizal Hall on September 12. REY BANIQUET/PPD 
Speaking truth to imperial power, Duterte gives a blunt lesson on Western genocide, during the recent ASEAN summit in Laos. How dare you tell it like it is! (Image by Baidu.com) 
Duterte is a semi-official socialist-populist. His cabinet is inclusive and consultative, with former imprisoned and exiled political opposition leaders, including communists and Muslims. He clearly can＊t stand America＊s grotesque, imperial arrogance and tyranny, in a country that has been a pliant doormat for US mayhem and exploitation in Asia, going back to the turn of the 19 th -20 th century. When Duterte＊s hometown of Davao was hit with a very suspicious, false flag smelling public market bombing, on September 2, 2016, he suggested that the automatic-to-blame Abu Sayyef Group, a Muslim independence outfit on his island of Mindanao, is controlled by US Special Forces based there, which is of course true. But, world leaders aren＊t supposed to speak truth to power, especially ※little brown brothers§, as Filipino Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay has described America＊s attitude to his long suffering and abused nation. http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/09/17/1624575/dfa-chief-philippines-no-little-brown-brother-us 
After signing with XJP more than three times as many development deals ($15 billion), as the US has totally invested to date in the Philippines ($4.7 billion), Duterte declared to the world that the ※US has lost§ and that his country was realigning with Baba Beijing. His official government/trade delegation had an unprecedented 300 members and another 150 business people paid their own way to join the Asian lovefest. The two sides set up bilateral committees to discuss and negotiate their South China Sea claims, which is anathema to Uncle Sam, who always insists on being the rabid Rottweiler in the middle. Next stop was US prostitute Japan, where he further declared that the Philippines would be free of all foreign military (meaning US marines and special forces), something that has not happened since 1521, when Spain began colonizing and raping the archipelago. 
This is all very powerful, history changing geopolitics. Almost every other world leader who has talked and acted like this, has either been overthrown and/or murdered by the West, sooner than later. Clearly, from the perspective of the West, Duterte＊s visionary, regional reset is closely tied to President Xi and China. It is for this reason that XJP may be getting the Slavic-Putin treatment on an accelerated schedule, in a desperate attempt to trash China＊s deep, historical leadership and trust role in Asia. 
The old story about people being able to see that the emperor is not wearing any clothes, is very apropos to Duterte. He is shouting out to the world that Western empire is a colossal failure and humiliation for his impoverished, exploited citizens, and by extension, equally so for every other member of humanity outside Eurangloland. http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2016/07/16/communist-china-vs-capitalist-philippines-vs-imperial-france-china-rising-radio-sinoland-160716/ . Once one person pierces the veil, it emboldens others to finally have the courage to pile on. 
For Uncle Sam, it＊s already happening. Malaysian Prime Minster Najib Razak is visiting XJP and Co. in Beijing, October 31-November 6, 2016, an unusually long state visit by a world leader. Najib has declared that Malaysia is committed to strengthening friendship with China and pushing ties to ※new highs§. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-china-idUSKCN12R0ZU . As more and more countries embrace China＊s history founding One Belt One Road plan, in which the whole world is and will benefit into the 22 nd century, including Eurangloland, expect ever more desperate, racist demonization and dehumanization of Xi Jinping and the Chinese people, along the lines of Putin and the Russians. Maybe the CIA-MI6 can dig up that old 19 th century chestnut, ※The Yellow Peril§, and give it a modern day makeover. Stay tuned to the New York Times, Radio France and the BBC , as the propaganda psyops campaign takes shape. 
As more and more world leaders are emboldened to speak out against Western tyranny, thanks to Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte＊s courage to make a public stand, President Xi Jinping can expect his face to morph into Putin＊s, who is diabolically pictured above on a January, 2014 Newsweek cover.

I am not sure sometimes, but it is indeed worrisome that an individual has the resources and connections to even attempt a color revolution. However, a similar ※rocking of the boat§ has been taking place in the U.S. with Ayles and the Koch brothers bankrolling a deep right revolution of the government. W ikileaks＊ Podesta Files shed light on US billionaire George Soros＊ deep concerns about the lack of ※freedom§ and ※constitutional democracy§ in Malaysia under Najib Razak. Soros＊ concerns may serve as a prelude for a series of ※color revolutions§ in Southeast Asia, Mathew Maavak of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia assumed in an interview with Sputnik.
The latest set of documents released by Wikileaks indicates that George Soros and his Open Society Foundation are very concerned about the situation in Malaysia, one of the US＊ longstanding allies in Southeast Asia. 
A memo , sent by Michael Vachon, US billionaire George Soros＊※right hand,§ on March 6, 2016, to Chairman of Clinton＊s presidential campaign John Podesta shed light on the Malaysian ※corruption crisis§ and blamed the country＊s Prime Minister Najib Razak for ※damaging the US＊ credibility in the region.§ 
※Malaysia could one day be a good ally of the United States in countering Islamic State [Daesh in Arabic] extremism, but not before it has achieved the freedom and constitutional democracy that its people have been denied,§ the memo read. However, it seems that the US financial and political elite have yet another reason to be dissatisfied with the Malaysian prime minister, besides his alleged involvement in corruption scandal. ※Malaysian Prime Minster Najib Razak heads to China next week to build closer ties and seek investment, which may further dent US aims in Southeast Asia after a push by President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines to bolster China ties,§ Reuters reported Thursday. Both Malaysia and the Philippines have long been in dispute with China over the South China Sea . However, Kuala Lumpur may follow in the footsteps of Manila, seeking to ease tensions with Beijing in exchange for economic benefits, the media outlet assumed. So, what did Soros mean by highlighting the need for democratic change in Malaysia? ＆There is no Business like the Revolutions Business＊ ※First and foremost, one needs to understand Soros and his business model,§ Mathew Maavak, a doctoral researcher in Risk Foresight at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) and regular contributor to CCTV told Sputnik. ※There is no business like the ＆revolutions business.＊ It is more lucrative than the show business which can flop due to an unforeseen shortcoming. Revolutions, on the other hand, only need to tap into the evergreen market of public discontent. NGOs and the West-friendly media constitute a major subsidiary of the global social revolutions enterprise. Together, they seek out, identify and amplify public discontent in nations not aligned to the United States. Such US-engineered activisms have never led to more equitable societies; rather they have engendered endless bloodshed and global terrorism,§ the researcher emphasized. Maavak dubbed these human rights entities and philanthropists ※agitprop entrepreneurs.§ ※To the agitprop entrepreneur, the returns on revolutionary investments are immense,§ he underscored. ※A wealthy hedge fund manager can short a targeted market before executing a pre-planned ＆revolution.＊ The resultant stock market and currency meltdown would provide self-evidentiary ＆proof＊ to an anxious public, exerting more pressure on the government of the day to either capitulate or concede to ＆popular demands＊ that are actually drafted abroad, likely by the IMF!§ ※Therefore, even if a revolution fails, the subsequent economic fallout would render local assets cheap for foreign acquisition,§ the researcher remarked. Soros＊ Alleged Role in Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 Maavak referred the Asian financial crisis in 1997, which started in Thailand with the financial collapse of the Thai baht, the country＊s national currency. ※That seemed like Soros business plan for Malaysia and the ASEAN region during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis,§ he noted. Indeed, some observers blame George Soros for the slump. South China Morning Post＊s columnist Zhou Xin went even further, stressing that Soros, ※whose aggressive currency trades were blamed for destroying the Thai and Malaysian economies§ in 1997 made yet another attempt to destabilize Asia＊s economies by targeting Hong Kong markets in 1998. ※The entire region was in turmoil, and the name of George Soros featured prominently in this sordid saga. The ＆Reformasi＊ [protest] movement led by sacked [Malaysian] Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim 〞 who had close to ties to Washington hawks 〞 failed to topple the government of the day,§ Maavak recalled. The Reformasi, kicked off in September 1998, consisted of civil disobedience, demonstrations, sit-ins, rioting, occupations and online activism, involving thousands across Malaysia protesting against the government. However, despite execrating Soros for his role in shorting the Malaysian currency, the ringgit, and for supporting the Reformasi movement, former Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad did little to stem the vast NGO and alternative media networks that were being built by the Open Society Foundation and its affiliates, backed by the US State Department, Maavak pointed out. ※There was a good reason for Mahathir＊s lack of decisiveness, apart from the occasional arrests and police raids,§ Maavak suggested, ※Upon stepping down from power, he used these same networks to oust his successor Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, and is now using the same Fifth Column to attempt the ouster of current Prime Minister Najib Razak.§ A Series of Domino ＆Color Revolutions＊ in Southeast Asia ※Without chaos in ASEAN, Soros and the transnational capitalist class may stand to lose a lot of money,§ the researcher suggested. ※They need Najib ousted as a prelude to a series of domino ＆color revolutions＊ in the region. In Malaysia, the color chosen was yellow and it is used by the Bersih (Clean) coalition that probably sees [Democratic presidential nominee] Hillary Clinton as the paragon of virtue and transparent governance,§ he assumed. Maavak＊s prognosis is by no means groundless, given the fact that ASEAN countries have signaled their willingness to strengthen their ties with China, drifting away from Washington. ※Washington has suffered geopolitical setbacks in virtually every nation in Asia Pacific,§ Tony Cartalucci, a Bangkok-based geopolitical analyst, noted in his recent article for New Eastern Outlook, stressing that the US＊ influence is rapidly waning across the Asia Pacific region . 
Bidding for hegemony in Asia Pacific US financial and political elite will do whatever it takes to curtail China＊s influence and pressure ASEAN economies into obeying Washington, according to Maavak.

How will the US empire end?,"The Anti-Empire Report #146 By William Blum 每 Published November 6th, 2016 L ouis XVI needed a revolution, Napoleon needed two historic military defeats, the Spanish Empire in the New World needed multiple revolutions, the Russian Czar needed a communist revolution, the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires needed World War I, Nazi Germany needed World War II, Imperial Japan needed two atomic bombs, the Portuguese Empire in Africa needed a military coup at home, the Soviet Empire needed Mikhail Gorbachev ＃ What will the American Empire need? ABOVE: Nuremberg tribunal. A new one is in order to try most of the political leaders, CEOs, media barons and their prostitutes, and similar agents of domination, exploitation, endless war, and imperialism for the past 100 years. ※I don＊t believe anyone will consciously launch World War III. The situation now is more like the eve of World War I, when great powers were armed and ready to go when an incident set things off. Ever since Gorbachev naively ended the Cold War, the hugely over-armed United States has been actively surrounding Russia with weapons systems, aggressive military exercises, NATO expansion. At the same time, in recent years the demonization of Vladimir Putin has reached war propaganda levels. Russians have every reason to believe that the United States is preparing for war against them, and are certain to take defensive measures. This mixture of excessive military preparations and propaganda against an ※evil enemy§ make it very easy for some trivial incident to blow it all up.§ 每 Diana Johnstone, author of ※Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton§ ALL IN THE FAMILY Just pals, all of them, just pals. It＊s all been such a joyful ride. Obviously neither Clinton, nor Obama, or Carter, find anything amiss in celebrating George W Bush, one of the worst criminals in modern history. (George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, April 25, 2013. Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) In September 2013 President Obama stood before the United Nations General Assembly and declared, ※I believe America is exceptional.§ The following year at the UN, the president classified Russia as one of the three threats to the world along with the Islamic State and the ebola virus. On March 9, 2015 President Barack Obama declared Venezuela ※an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States§. Vladimir Putin, speaking at the UN in 2015, addressing the United States re its foreign policy: ※Do you realize what you have done?§ Since the end of World War 2, the United States has: Attempted to overthrow more than 50 foreign governments, most of which were democratically-elected. Dropped bombs on the people of more than 30 countries. Attempted to assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders. Attempted to suppress a populist or nationalist movement in 20 countries. Grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries.* Plus ＃ although not easily quantified ＃ has been more involved in the practice of torture than any other country in the world ＃ for over a century ＃ not just performing the actual torture, but teaching it, providing the manuals, and furnishing the equipment. *See chapter 18 of William Blum, ※Rogue State: A Guide to the World＊s Only Superpower§ On October 28, 2016 Russia was voted off the UN Human Rights Council. At the same time Saudi Arabia won a second term, uncontested. Does anyone know George Orwell＊s email address? A million refugees from Washington＊s warfare are currently over-running Europe. They＊re running from Afghanistan and Iraq; from Libya and Somalia; from Syria and Pakistan. Germany is taking in many Syrian refugees because of its World War Two guilt. What will the United States do in the future because of its guilt? But Americans are not raised to feel such guilt. ※ The Plan is for the United States to rule the world. The overt theme is unilateralism, but it is ultimately a story of domination. It calls for the United States to maintain its overwhelming superiority and prevent new rivals from rising up to challenge it on the world stage. It calls for dominion over friends and enemies alike. It says not that the United States must be more powerful, or most powerful, but that it must be absolutely powerful.§ Vice-President Dick Cheney 每 West Point lecture, June 2002 Two flew over the cuckoo＊s nest: ※We are, as a matter of empirical fact and undeniable history, the greatest force for good the world has ever known. ＃ security and freedom for millions of people around the globe have depended on America＊s military , economic, political, and diplomatic might.§ 每 Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney, ※Why the world needs a powerful America§ (2015) State Department spokesperson Mark Toner: ※Assad must go even if Syria goes with him.§ Many of the moves the Obama administration has made in terms of its Cuba policy are in lockstep with Bill Clinton＊s, as expressed in the recommendations of a 1999 task force report from the Council on Foreign Relations. The report asserted that ※no change in policy should have the primary effect of consolidating, or appearing to legitimize, the political status quo on the island.§ A successful American regime change operation in Syria would cut across definite interests of the Russian state. These include the likely use of Syria as a new pipeline route to bring gas from Qatar to the European market, thereby undercutting Gazprom, Russia＊s largest corporation and biggest exporter. Assad＊s refusal to consider such a route played no small role in Qatar＊s pouring billions of dollars in arms and funds into the Syrian civil war on behalf of anti-Assad forces. ※War with Russia will be nuclear. Washington has prepared for it. Washington has abandoned the ABM treaty, created what it thinks is an ABM shield, and changed its war doctrine to permit US nuclear first strike. All of this is obviously directed at Russia, and the Russian government knows it. How long will Russia sit there waiting for Washington＊s first strike?§ 每 Paul Craig Roberts, 2014 Iran signed the nuclear accords with the United States earlier this year by agreeing to stop what it never was doing. Any Iranian nuclear ambition, real or imagined, is of course a result of American hostility towards Iran, and not the other way around. If the European Union were an independent and rational government it would absolutely forbid any member country from stockpiling American nuclear weapons or hosting a US anti-ballistic missile site or any other military base anywhere close to Russia＊s borders. Full Spectrum Dominance , a term the Pentagon loves to use to refer to total control of the planet: land, sea, air, space, outer space and cyberspace. Can you imagine any other country speaking this way? Henry Kissinger at the Paris Peace Talks, September 1970. ※I refuse to believe that a little fourth rate power like North Vietnam does not have a breaking point.§ In 2010, WikiLeaks released a cable sent to US embassies by then- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She wrote this: ※Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, al Nusra and other terrorist groups ＃ worldwide.§ Surely this resulted in at least Washington＊s much-favored weapon: sanctions of various kinds. It did not. US General Barry McCaffrey , April 2015: ※Because so far NATO＊s reaction to Putin＊s aggression (sic) has been to send a handful of forces to the Baltics to demonstrate ＆resolve,＊ which has only convinced Putin that the alliance is either unable or unwilling to fight. So we had better change his calculus pretty soon, and contest Putin＊s stated doctrine that he is willing to intervene militarily in other countries to ＆protect＊ Russia-speaking people. For God＊s sake, the last time we heard that was just before Hitler invaded the Sudetenland.§ No, my dear general, we heard that repeatedly in 1978 when the United States invaded the tiny nation of Grenada to protect and rescue hundreds of Americans who supposedly were in danger from the new leftist government. It was all a fraud, no more than an excuse to overthrow a government that didn＊t believe that the American Empire was God＊s gift to humanity. Since 1980, the United States has intervened in the affairs of fourteen Muslim countries, at worst invading or bombing them. They are (in chronological order) Iran, Libya, Lebanon, Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo, Yemen, Pakistan, and now Syria. How our never-ending mideast horror began: Radio Address of George W. Bush, September 28, 2002: ※The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, is rebuilding the facilities to make more and, according to the British government, could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given. The regime has long-standing and continuing ties to terrorist groups, and there are al Qaeda terrorists inside Iraq. This regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, and with fissile material could build one within a year.§ Yet ＃ just six weeks before 9/11, Condoleezza Rice told CNN: ※Let＊s remember that his [Saddam＊s] country is divided, in effect. He does not control the northern part of his country. We are able to keep his arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt.§ The fact is that there is more participation by the Cuban population in the running of their country than there is by the American population in the running of theirs. One important reason is the absence of the numerous private corporations which, in the United States, exert great influence over all aspects of life. ※The U.S. is frantically surrounding China with military weapons, advanced aircraft, naval fleets and a multitude of military bases from Japan, South Korea and the Philippines through several nearby smaller Pacific islands to its new and enlarged base in Australia ＃ The U.S. naval fleet, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines patrol China＊s nearby waters. Warplanes, surveillance planes, drones and spying satellites cover the skies, creating a symbolic darkness at noon.§ (Jack A. Smith, ※Hegemony Games: USA vs. PRC§, CounterPunch) Crimea had never voluntarily left Russia. The USSR＊s leader Nikita Khrushchev, a native of the region, had donated Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Crimeans were always strongly opposed to that change and voted overwhelmingly to rejoin Russia after the US-induced Ukrainian coup in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin refers to the Ukrainian army as ※NATO＊s foreign legion§, which does not pursue Ukraine＊s national interests. The United States, however, insists on labeling the Russian action in Crimea as an invasion. Putin re Crimea/Ukraine: ※Our western partners (sic) created the ＆Kosovo precedent＊ with their own hands. In a situation absolutely the same as the one in Crimea they recognized Kosovo＊s secession from Serbia legitimate while arguing that no permission from a country＊s central authority for a unilateral declaration of independence is necessary＃ And the UN International Court of Justice agreed with those arguments. That＊s what they said; that＊s what they trumpeted all over the world and coerced everyone to accept 每 and now they are complaining about Crimea. Why is that?§ Paul Craig Roberts: ※The absurdity of it all! Even a moron knows that if Russia is going to put tanks and troops into Ukraine, Russia will put in enough to do the job. The war would be over in a few days if not in a few hours. As Putin himself said some months ago, if the Russian military enters Ukraine, the news will not be the fate of Donetsk or Mauriupol, but the fall of Kiev and Lviv.§ In a major examination of US policy vis-角-vis China, published in March 2015, the authoritative Council on Foreign Relations bluntly declared that ※there is no real prospect of building fundamental trust, ＆peaceful coexistence,＊ ＆mutual understanding,＊ a strategic partnership, or a ＆new type of major country relations＊ between the United States and China.§ The United States, the report declares, must, therefore, develop ※the political will§ and military capabilities ※to deal with China to protect vital U.S. interests.§ ※John F. Kennedy changed the mission of the Latin American military from ＆hemispheric defense＊ 每 an outdated relic of World War II 每 to ＆internal security,＊ which means war against the domestic population.§ 每 Noam Chomsky Cuban baseball players who are paid a million dollars to play for an American team are not ※defectors§, a word which has a clear political connotation. Boris Yeltsin was acceptable to American and Europeans because he was seen as a weak, pliable figure that allowed Western capital free rein in the newly opened Russian territory following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin＊s era was also a time of rampant corruption by Russian oligarchs who were closely associated with Western capital. That corrosive culture came to a halt with the election of Vladimir Putin twice as president between 2000-2008, and again in 2012. Many ISIS leaders were former Iraqi military officers who were imprisoned by American troops. The fight isn＊t against ISIS, it＊s against Assad; at the next level it isn＊t against Assad, it＊s against Putin; then, at the next level, it isn＊t against Putin, it＊s against the country most likely to stand in the way of US world domination, Russia. And it＊s forever. Connecting to the US-based Internet would mean channeling all of Cuba＊s communications directly to the NSA. George W. Bush has been living a comparatively quiet life in Texas, with a focus on his paintings. ※I＊m trying to leave something behind§, he said a couple of years ago. Yeah, right, George. We can stand up some of the paintings against the large piles of Iraqi dead bodies. Seymour Hirsch: ※America would be much better off, if, 30 years ago, we had let Russia continue its war in Afghanistan ＃ The mistake was made by the Carter administration which was trying to stop the Russians from their invasion (sic) of Afghanistan. We＊d be better off had we let the Russians beat the Taliban.§ ( Deutsche Welle , April 2, 2014 interview) We＊d be even better off if we hadn＊t overthrown the progressive, secular Afghan government, giving rise to the Taliban in the first place and inciting the Russians to intervene on their border lest the Soviet Islamic population was stirred up. The former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in an interview in 1998 summed up exactly what the US thinks of the UN: ※The UN plays a very important role. But if we don＊t like it, we always have the option of following our own national security interests, which I assure you we will do if we don＊t like what＊s going on.§ She is now a foreign-policy advisor to Hillary Clinton. ※A leader taking his (or her) nation to war is as dysfunctional in the family of humankind as an abusive parent is in an individual family.§ 每 Suey Kane ※It would be some time before I fully realized that the United States sees little need for diplomacy. Power is enough. Only the weak rely on diplomacy ＃ The Roman Empire had no need for diplomacy. Nor does the United States.§ 每 Boutros Boutros-Ghali , Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1992 to December 1996 ※Interventions are not against dictators but against those who try to distribute: not against Jim谷nez in Venezuela but Ch芍vez, not against Somoza in Nicaragua but the Sandinistas, not against Batista in Cuba but Castro, not against Pinochet in Chile but Allende, not against Guatemala dictators but Arbenz, not against the shah in Iran but Mossadegh, etc.§ 每 Johan Galtung, Norwegian, principal founder of the discipline of peace and conflict studies ※No mention was made that Iraq＊s Christians had been safe and sound under President Saddam Hussein 每 even privileged 每 until President George Bush invaded and destroyed Iraq. We can expect the same fate for Syria＊s Christians if the protection of the Assad regime is torn away by the US-engineered uprising. We will then shed crocodile tears for Syria＊s Christians.§ 每 Eric Margolis, 2014 ※Jewish Power is the capacity to silence the debate on Jewish Power.§ 每 Gilad Atzmon ※We need a trial to judge all those who bear significant responsibility for the past century 每 the most murderous and ecologically destructive in human history. We could call it the war, air and fiscal crimes tribunal and we could put politicians and CEOs and major media owners in the dock with earphones like Eichmann and make them listen to the evidence of how they killed millions of people and almost murdered the planet and made most of us far more miserable than we needed to be. Of course, we wouldn＊t have time to go after them one by one. We＊d have to lump Wall Street investment bankers in one trial, the Council on Foreign Relations in another, and any remaining Harvard Business School or Yale Law graduates in a third. We don＊t need this for retribution, only for edification. So there would be no capital punishment, but rather banishment to an overseas Nike factory with a vow of perpetual silence.§ 每 Sam Smith ※I have come to think of the export of ＆democracy＊ as the contemporary equivalent of what missionaries have always done in the interest of conquering and occupying the ＆uncivilized＊ world on behalf of the powers that be. I have said that the ＆church＊ invented the concept of conversion by any means, including torture and killing of course, as doing the victims a big favor, since it was in the interest of ＆saving＊ their immortal souls. It is now called, ＆democratization＊.§ 每 Rita Corriel ※It is more or less impossible to commemorate the war dead without glorifying them, and it is impossible to glorify them without glorifying their wars.§ 每 Paul Craig Roberts Any part of this report may be disseminated without permission, provided attribution to William Blum as author and a link to williamblum.org is provided.

Hit critiques takes on extra bite in the context of the rise of racism and xenophobia, misogyny, and the crassest brutality, in the United States. It would do everyone well to wake up and carefully look at what is happening to the left. P eople all over the world are fed up with capitalism. They don＊t always know how to formulate their aversions anymore (the result of a confusing ＆education＊ and disinformation campaign pouring out of the West), but intuitively they are increasingly longing for socialism or even Communism; definitely for some humane, compassionate system based on social justice, kindness and anti-imperialist principles.
Such sentiments are everywhere, in countries as diverse as the Philippines and Bolivia, South Africa and Kirgizstan. 
The rulers and propagandists in the West are well aware of this ＆dangerous trend＊, and they are trying to reverse it with increasing determination 每 even with brutal force. 
In the past, they used to simply try to fully ideologically discredit all socialist and Communist thoughts. Billions of dollars were spent on propaganda and disinformation, on ＆re-education＊ of the masses in all corners of the globe, on targeted scholarships and tactics aimed at dividing the Left. This approach was successful, but only to a certain degree. All over the world, the leftist revolutionary ideas would lose some ground for a while, but then they would re-emerge again, often under some new labels and banners. 
Lately, the Empire has begun changing its strategy. Instead of trying to contain its main adversaries, it has decided to exterminate them ＆intellectually＊ once and for all. And how better to do it than by what it always does the best 每 by spreading confusion, nihilism and chaos! 
* 
Instead of attacking socialism and Communism directly, the Empire has begun its massive campaign to discredit most of the countries that are being governed by left-wing governments and movements. This is of course by itself nothing new. What is ＆innovative＊ is that this time Western propaganda has actually began arguing that the anti-imperialist countries are essentially not left wing at all, that they are more capitalist than the West itself, that they are ＆anti-people＊, and sometimes even fascist. 
New derogatory and thoroughly grotesque terms like ＆state capitalism＊ have been invented and put to destructive work. These terms have then been repeated so often that they have become normalized, and eventually been adopted by the Western ＆soft left＊, the liberal media and academia, as well as by the countless ＆progressive＊ but anti-Communist movements 每 including anarchists. 
While I was told by some of the greatest revolutionary figures like Eduardo Galeano and Pramoedya Ananta Toer, that it is time for ＆un-dusting the old flags and symbols＊ (and they were clearly talking about the socialist and Communist ones), the Western official propaganda and much of the Western ＆left＊ were busy spreading their vitriolic but contagious doctrines that ＆the labels＊ should be once and for all declared obsolete. ※I don＊t want to be part of any political party or any movement§, one hears increasingly from millions of couch and cafe revolutionaries in cities like London or Paris. ※I don＊t like to be labeled§. Or typically so in those places: ※I have my own mind§. 
Except where there are no structures, no strong organization, no labels or flags, there can be no true victory. 
But who cares about victory? Soon it became clear that the ＆progressive＊ Western ＆opposition＊ was not truly seeking to take power or to implement real revolutionary changes. It wanted to ＆improve things at home＊, instead of abolishing the entire monstrous world order. It felt cozy and comfortable being a toothless discussion club, hating everything that was truly fighting, risking life while trying to stop imperialism and the Empire from devouring the Planet. 
Thus was born the grand quiet alliance of the Western establishment (the Empire), the liberals and of those undefined (or of loosely defined) movements like the anarchists. It was directly antagonistic to almost all the countries where the Left was by now holding power. It ＆distrusted＊ leading revolutionary figures. Needless to say 每 the criticism of the world revolutions has been based strictly on Western liberal values and doctrines. 
Those countries that decided to face the Western Empire were generally labeled as un-democratic, as being arch violators of human rights. Socialist nations became the main target of the propaganda. Their every move has been scrutinized, each error blown out of proportion. Grotesquely, the West was, as mentioned above, now criticizing them for ＆not being socialist enough, or socialist at all＊. It is because the demagogues in London, New York and Paris knew perfectly well that socialism, even Communism, is once again, for many people all over the world a great asset, not liability. 
In the meantime, millions of ＆purists＊ from the pseudo-Left in the West got engaged in endless and pointless theoretical debates about what was or not true socialism and Communism. 
※Is socialism, the Chinese way, truly socialism?§ they are repeating, like parrots, all over Europe and North America. ※Is Russia socialist at all, or is it governed by a strongman and by a bunch of selfish oligarchs?§ And of course: ※How socialist are countries like Iran or South Africa?§ 
The verdict of the purists is always extremely stern. Almost nobody manages to survive the scrutiny! The purists in the West don＊t hold power, and it is apparent that they don＊t really want to. They bark. They philosophize. They throw sticks into the wheels of those who are truly and determinedly fighting for a better world. They ridicule the revolutions and any powerful left-leaning state. 
Victorious and actively militant anti-imperialist governments and nations make them feel irrelevant, obsolete, embarrassing. 
And the Empire knows it. It understands. It uses the soft Western left against the arch socialist and Communist enemies. 
It is using soft left effectively because it is selfish, cowardly and it lacks discipline. But above all, because it is self enamored. 
* 
And so, in great unison with the Western Empire＊s palace propagandists, the soft Western anti-Communist ＆left＊ is arguing that the governing Left all over the world is not really true left, that the countries that call themselves socialist are in fact more capitalist than the West, and the world can only be saved by some extremely vaguely defined and abstract system of collective production means (unrealistic and utopian, as nowhere except in the West and in a handful of countries inhabited by European descendants, like Argentina, would such concepts be supported by the masses). 
The new alliance is against China, Russia, South Africa, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, Syria, Iran, Eritrea; it is basically against all countries that are still opting for an independent, anti-imperialist course. 
All these countries are ＆wrong＊. All of them are brutally ＆oppressing their people＊ and in almost all of them the local ＆oligarchs are more brutal than in the West＊. 
You look closer, and it＊s all manipulation and lies, or at best half-truths. However, ＆falsehoods repeated a thousand times have a tendency of becoming the truth＊, as an ＆icon＊ of German Nazism explained many decades ago. And so it goes＃ 
Fabrications are sinking deeper and deeper into the sub-conscience of the people, in the West but also in countries that are being targeted. Nobody dares to protest, to scream loudly: ※Nonsense! These countries are actually socialist!§ 
What eyes are seeing and what the brains are conditioned to ＆conclude＊ are suddenly two thoroughly different things. 
The strategy of the Western Empire is clear: it makes things thoroughly confused, too complex to understand, lacking in transparency. 
※Capitalist China, right-wing Russia, anti-black South Africa, state-capitalist Venezuela, monolithic and Fascist DPRK. Who would want to follow their examples? Better to accept the familiar Western fundamentalist capitalism and imperialism§. That＊s what the world is being maneuvered into thinking. 
Brilliant indoctrination strategy! Except＃ Red flags, fresh from being washed, are proudly waving all over the world, once again. In China and Russia, in South Africa and in so many other places, people are proudly returning to the old labels. 
Not everyone can understand, anymore, but many are still able too feel, instinctively, and as a result of these basic human impulses, a violent clash between depressing deceit and simple human desires and dreams will soon become imminent.

15 years ago, I was the first one to import a high quality saturated fat called ※Virgin Coconut Oil§ from the Philippines and market it in the U.S. market. Coconut oil is a traditional fat that has been consumed for thousand of years in tropical climates, where historically western diseases like heart disease, diabetes, obesity and others were not common, in spite of their high saturated fat diet. 
During World War II when the Japanese cut of the supply of the high saturated fat edible oils like coconut oil and palm oil with their occupation of the Philippines and other Southeastern nations, industry in the U.S. developed the ※expeller-pressed§ method of extracting oil from seeds that had not previously been a source of dietary oil, mainly the U.S. cash crops of soybeans and corn. These polyunsaturated oils were not shelf-stable edible oils, so the industrial process of ※homogenization§ was developed to make them more shelf stable, and behave more like shelf-stable saturated fats. 
Politics, not science, influenced government agencies like the USDA to promote these new polyunsaturated oils as more healthy than saturated fats. A new dietary dogma of ※low-fat§ was developed, and history now shows that America＊s health greatly suffered as a result. Until even today, we have seen very high numbers of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease plaguing Americans. 
So it was with much opposition 15 years ago that I presented the real science behind coconut oil and saturated fats, but many now are waking up to the terrible consequences of following the government-sponsored low-fat diet dogma for so many years. 
One can truly turn their health around by simply making a dietary choice as to the types of fats one consumes, and increase the consumption of healthy fats, particularly when those fats in the diet replace harmful processed carbohydrates.

New Order Issued for Detainment and Quarantines,"Forced vaccinations are already common around the world, and President Obama＊s Executive Order may make this a reality in the U.S. also. Photo courtesy of Dawn.com . 
by Paul Fassa Health Impact News 
Almost on the eve of the 2016 presidential election, outgoing president Barack Obama issued an executive order that is intended to coordinate all the world＊s health agencies in alignment with the CDC＊s intention to increase detainment and quarantining guidelines enforcement worldwide. 
Executive orders (EO) are legally binding as laws, though an incoming president can issue EOs to cancel or revise some of those issued by the previous president. They are handy for an administration to avoid Congressional delays and conflicts, which can create unfavorable amendments or nullifying it completely. 
Congress can also amend executive orders and the Supreme Court can nullify them. But those are lengthy and give the administration involved time to enforce the executive order through the executive branches several agencies, including the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The executive branch can end-around Congress to create statutes and enforceable policies with executive orders, euphemistically called ※presidential memoranda§ these days. Executive Order to be Used Against Vaccine Resistance? 
This recent executive order is of grave concern for advocates of health freedom. It is called ※Advancing the Global Health Security Agenda to Achieve a World Safe and Secure from Infectious Disease Threats,§ and it was signed and issued on November 4 th , 2016. 
It seems innocuous at first glance, but one set of initials shows up often, GHSA . It stands for Global Health Security Agenda. 
This term first appeared in a CDC proposal in 2014, during the Disney measles outbreak. This proposal focused mostly on its ※vaccine package.§ It rested comfortably on the nationally orchestrated outcry against vaccination resistance . Some journalists even suggested jailing parents who did not have their children vaccinated. 
Several state legislators jumped in with proposals to create laws mandating vaccinations by removing exemptions previously allowed and not allowing kids to attend school without vaccine compliance. Fortunately for the rest of the nation, only California succeeded completely with State Senator Pan＊s push of SB 277 despite strong grassroots opposition. 
The hysteria made it into presidential politics. Congressional Senator Bernie Sanders, who was vying to become the Democratic presidential nominee, declared in so many words that unvaccinated children are killers prior to his attempted run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. 
Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton openly declared: 
※The science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and vaccines work. Let＊s protect all our kids.§ 
All this innocently ignorant or pharmaceutical industry rewarded hysteria was perfect timing for the CDC to set the goals expected to be implemented within five years of 2015. Here is some of their 2014 ※suggested§ policy that is now framed within Obama＊s recent Executive Order: A functioning national vaccine delivery system that is able to respond to new disease threats. At least 90% coverage of the country＊s fifteen-month-old population with at least one dose of measles containing vaccines. Note: The CDC＊s doctored Atlanta children vaccine 2004 study threw out evidence proving children under three years of age were vulnerable to autism from the MMR, per testimony and original documents provided by CDC whistleblower Dr. William Thompson . The CDC claimed in this document that their emphasis on measles serves as a proxy for what they consider ※vaccine preventable disease (VPD)§ compliance. It also helps that most of the nation was swept up in pro-vaccination hysteria after the not so large Disney measles outbreak that resulted in no deaths. In other words, the CDC is seeking absolute 90 percent plus compliance eventually with all VPDs, even as records of outbreaks among highly vaccinated populations prove vaccines are not so effective after all. A fact denied is how extremely dangerous vaccines are and how they create lowered health among those spared serious acute vaccine injuries. (Source) 
This late 2014 CDC document is the root of Obama＊s recent (November 4, 2016) executive order that grants worldwide government health agency cooperation and police power, even from Interpol (The International Criminal Police Organization (ICPO). 
Also mentioned as sources of policing the unvaccinated and suspected disease carriers in this are the Department of Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security. Serious policing, indeed. More CDC Vaccination Policy to Bolster Their 2014 Policy ※Suggestions§ 
To bolster the initial 2014 vaccine package, the CDC issued a proposed directive for isolating and quarantining suspected disease carriers in August of 2016. This time it was a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) in the Federal Register to amend the Public Health Service Act, which governs public health law. 
It＊s uncertain if public feedback, allowed until October 14th, 2016, had any influence on this CDC proposal to amend public health policy or not. 
National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) founder Barbara Loe Fisher was on the forefront of public feedback, leading an NVIC petition to the CDC. Over 15,000 comments overall were sent to the CDC, mostly protesting this latest move toward medical tyranny. 
Often the FDA, USDA, or CDC＊s opening for public commentary is merely a procedural formality that has little to no effect on the outcome. This has apparently happened once again. 
The CDC＊s recent NPRM makes it possible for anyone, including those who are employed in travel services, to be a snitch and report suspected illness . Isolation can extend to a 72 hour detainment to determine one＊s potential or actual disease level and enforce treatment or vaccination as a condition for being released. 
After you＊ve been released, you could be electronically monitored. As usual, the viral shedding of vaccinated individuals that spreads disease is ignored. Jail time and large fines can be used against those who refuse to cooperate. 
Page 32 of this 88 page NPRM document gives examples of quarantining passengers of commercial aircraft and ocean going vessels under the heading of CONTACT INVESTIGATION (CI) CRITERIA BY DISEASE. 
Several life threatening diseases are mentioned, including Ebola, MERS, SARS, TB, and others, as well as measles . Most CIs thus far are measles cases. According to this document, CIs should be isolated according to their proximity of an individual with symptoms of any of the diseases listed. How they＊re handled is advised in the column with the heading ※Recommended activities.§ 
Here＊s the recommended activity for those in proximity of traveling measles cases (verbatim): ※MMR vaccination if unvaccinated and <72 hrs since exposure; immune globulin if indicated and within 6 days of exposure.§ (Source) False Media Fear Hysteria Helps Promote Medical Tyranny 
There＊s a chain of historical events that demonstrate the disaster of enforced vaccination policies, starting with the cowpox vaccine for small pox in England and elsewhere, excerpted from NaturoDoc.com. 
＃ compulsory smallpox vaccination campaigns in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that played a major role in decimating the populations of Japan (48,000 deaths), England and Wales (44,840 deaths, after 97 percent of the population had been vaccinated), Scotland, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, Holland, Italy, India (3 million 〞 all vaccinated), Australia, Germany (124,000 deaths), Prussia (69,000 deaths 〞 all re-vaccinated), and the Philippines. The epidemics ended in cities where smallpox vaccinations were either discontinued or never begun, and also after sanitary reforms were instituted (most notably in Munich 〞 1880, Leicester 〞 1878, Barcelona 〞 1804, Alicante 〞 1827, India 〞 1906, etc). [Emphasis added] (Source) 
Fast forward to the Swine Flu episode that led to legislated vaccine industry exemption from liability lawsuits. This episode occurred in 1976, where one Army boot camp trainee fell ill, but went on a forced full pack march and died. His was the only death from that flu. But many died or were paralyzed from the vaccine rather than the flu. Here＊s that story . 
More recently, another Swine Flu scare was exposed as false by intrepid CBS News producer Sharyl Attkinson, author of the book Stonewalled . 
Her investigative pursuit for actual facts regarding vaccines may have helped force her ※resignation§ from CBS. She and her team were investigating the 2009 and previous year＊s Swine Flu, which was classified as a pandemic or worldwide epidemic based solely on the numbers of purported stricken victims. 
After the CDC announced they were no longer tracking Swine Flu incidents and deaths, Sharyl and her team wanted to know why, but the CDC refused to respond. 
Using Freedom of Information Act＊s (FOI) provisions, they went to each state＊s Board of Health agency and discovered the actual count of H1N1 Swine Flu cases was incredibly low, single digits in some states. The majority of actual cases were not even any version of the flu. 
The CDC responded by publicly claiming there were a million or more H1N1 cases in the USA alone, and millions worldwide. The CDC and WHO simply lied about the whole thing and got away with it. (Source) 
CDC and WHO epidemics are psy-ops (psychological operations) designed to create hysteria and have everyone roll up their sleeves to receive those shots that enrich vaccine makers＊ coffers. And flu shot adverse reactions are the most commonly represented in the government＊s vaccine court , the legislatively designated ※buffer§ protecting the vaccine industry from direct lawsuits. 
What large scale death toll has occurred from any of the several contagious diseases covered by mainstream media over the past few decades since that 1976 Swine Flu debacle? None. 
Yet whether Ebola or Zika or SARs or MERs or Bird Flu or Swine Flu, the hysterical fear mongering has its way on mainstream media as though it＊s factual, actual, and pressing. 
The original 1956 movie ※Invasion of the Body Snatchers§ and its 1978 remake of the same name, both of which coined the term ※pod people,§ were about humans overtaken and recreated in pods, which then become obedient drones for the masterminds of invading aliens. 
They are beyond Sci-Fi. They are simply accurate portrayals of our current human condition: Ignoring without questioning what＊s really going on all around them over and over again and getting their vaccinations.

On the opposite side, for all his personal pathology problems and incoherent twitter-mouth ramblings, Donald Trump seemed to be on the money when he said that if elected, Hillary would use Syria to unleash WWIII.
To check out if that holds, let?s start with an essential backup.
The ?Queen of War?, at the final US presidential debate in Las Vegas: "" A no-fly zone [in Syria] can save lives and hasten the end of the conflict. ""
The ?Queen of War?, in one of her 2013 speeches to Goldman Sachs, published by WikiLeaks: a no-fly zone would "" kill a lot of Syrians .?
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, speaking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: a no-fly zone in Syria ? would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia. ""
No-fly zone would ?require war with #Syria and #Russia ? ? top US general https://t.co/veSy8uETak pic.twitter.com/zXyCmWjdXj
? RT America (@RT_America) September 22, 2016 Predictably, the Clinton (cash) machine has been relentless promoting Hillary?s no-fly zone. Whenever cornered, the machine switches the narrative to Russian hacking of the DNC. Edward Snowden, who knows a thing or two about cyberwarfare, stresses there is no solid proof Russian intel hacked the Democratic/Clinton machine. And if they actually did it, the NSA would know. The fact the NSA is mum reveals this is no more than information war.
Pass the missile launchers, please Trump seems to have been more on the money when he insisted how Hillary will be outsmarted ? as she already was in the past ? when dealing with President Putin, who she has demonized as Hitler.
I have shown how Hillary will be prevented from launching WWIII because her no-fly zone is already implemented in Syria by Russia. And the Pentagon ? reflecting Dunford?s comments - knows it, no matter how emphatically soon-to-be-unemployed Pentagon head Ash Carter threatens ? consequences .?
The Pentagon ranks Russia and China as the number one and two ?existential threats? to US national security, in that order. And the US government reserves for itself the privilege of a nuclear ?first-strike? ? which Hillary supports (but not Trump); this is part of the 2002 Full Spectrum Dominance doctrine.
The relentless hysteria now crystallized as Cold War 2.0 has led scores of analysts to game the actual ? terrifying - possibility of a US-Russia hot war. As much as the Cold War MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) doctrine may now lie in the dust ? exactly because Washington refuses to back down from ?first-strike? ? only armchair Dr. Strangeloves get their kicks with the possibility of fighting a nuclear power. Dunford does not seem to be one of them.
What Hillary Clinton will certainly do is to double down on proxy wars, Vietnam/Afghanistan-style. So expect a President Clinton to authorize full weaponization of those Beltway-loved ?moderate? Al-Qaeda-in-Syria rebels with plenty of shoulder-held missile launchers. This could easily get out of control ? with lethal, yet not nuclear, consequences.
That?s exactly the point made by Mikhail Rostovsky in Moscow daily Moskovsky Komsomolets; if Hillary ratchets up tensions, ? things could get out of hand .?
Also expect not so proxy ratcheting up of tension in the South China Sea; after all it was Hillary who claimed ?mothership? of the pivot to Asia; and it was Hillary who steered intra-South East Asian maritime disputes into the boiling cauldron of wider US-China competition.
And if that was not hard boiled enough, US frustration will be at an all-time high after Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte?s own pivot to China.
Say hello to my new Sarmat A case can be made that official Moscow is carefully getting ready to work with a Clinton ? as in Obama III ? presidency, with Hillary, a devil they know well when she was Secretary of State, to be dealt with as a pragmatist, unwilling and unable to plunge US-Russia relations into total incandescence.
A Clinton presidency for its part should know better than overestimate Russia?s financial ? weakness. ?
The national debt of Russia is only 17.7 percent of GDP; for the US it is a whopping 104.17 percent of GDP, or $19.2 trillion. Russia in 2015 had a trade surplus of $150 billion, while the US had a trade deficit of $531.5 billion. The current account surplus of Russia was 5.1 percent of GDP, or 65.8 billion, while the US ran a current account deficit of 484.1 billion, or 2.7 percent of GDP.
Besides, Russia has all the natural resources it needs; unlike the US government, which believes it needs an empire of bases overseas and ten aircraft carrier task forces to secure the resources it lacks.
Moreover, as much as the Pentagon may continue to be infested by neocon cells, sound generals are also able to identify key Russian signals ? such as the unveiling of the RS-28 Sarmat nuclear missile, which NATO calls Satan 2. The Sarmat delivers monster warheads of 40 megatons; boasts a top speed of seven kilometers per second; and is able to outfox any anti-missile shield system anywhere.

By Jeffrey D. Sachs
 Boston Globe "" - THE SINGLE MOST important issue in allocating national resources is war versus peace, or as macroeconomists put it, ?guns versus butter.? The United States is getting this choice profoundly wrong, squandering vast sums and undermining national security. In economic and geopolitical terms, America suffers from what Yale historian Paul Kennedy calls ?imperial overreach.? If our next president remains trapped in expensive Middle East wars, the budgetary costs alone could derail any hopes for solving our vast domestic problems.
It may seem tendentious to call America an empire, but the term fits certain realities of US power and how it?s used. An empire is a group of territories under a single power. Nineteenth-century Britain was obviously an empire when it ruled India, Egypt, and dozens of other colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The United States directly rules only a handful of conquered islands (Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands), but it stations troops and has used force to influence who governs in dozens of other sovereign countries. That grip on power beyond America?s own shores is now weakening.
The scale of US military operations is remarkable. The US Department of Defense has (as of a 2010 inventory) 4,999 military facilities, of which 4,249 are in the United States; 88 are in overseas US territories; and 662 are in 36 foreign countries and foreign territories, in all regions of the world. Not counted in this list are the secret facilities of the US intelligence agencies. The cost of running these military operations and the wars they support is extraordinary, around $900 billion per year, or 5 percent of US national income, when one adds the budgets of the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies, homeland security, nuclear weapons programs in the Department of Energy, and veterans benefits. The $900 billion in annual spending is roughly one-quarter of all federal government outlays.
The United States has a long history of using covert and overt means to overthrow governments deemed to be unfriendly to US interests, following the classic imperial strategy of rule through locally imposed friendly regimes. In a powerful study of Latin America between 1898 and 1994, for example, historian John Coatsworth counts 41 cases of ?successful? US-led regime change, for an average rate of one government overthrow by the United States every 28 months for a century. And note: Coatsworth?s count does not include the failed attempts, such as the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.
This tradition of US-led regime change has been part and parcel of US foreign policy in other parts of the world, including Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Wars of regime change are costly to the United States, and often devastating to the countries involved. Two major studies have measured the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. One, by my Columbia colleague Joseph Stiglitz and Harvard scholar Linda Bilmes, arrived at the cost of $3 trillion as of 2008. A more recent study, by the Cost of War Project at Brown University, puts the price tag at $4.7 trillion through 2016. Over a 15-year period, the $4.7 trillion amounts to roughly $300 billion per year, and is more than the combined total outlays from 2001 to 2016 for the federal departments of education, energy, labor, interior, and transportation, and the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
It is nearly a truism that US wars of regime change have rarely served America?s security needs. Even when the wars succeed in overthrowing a government, as in the case of the Taliban in Afghanistan, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and Moammar Khadafy in Libya, the result is rarely a stable government, and is more often a civil war. A ?successful? regime change often lights a long fuse leading to a future explosion, such as the 1953 overthrow of Iran?s democratically elected government and installation of the autocratic Shah of Iran, which was followed by the Iranian Revolution of 1979. In many other cases, such as the US attempts (with Saudi Arabia and Turkey) to overthrow Syria?s Bashar al-Assad, the result is a bloodbath and military standoff rather than an overthrow of the government.
WHAT IS THE DEEP motivation for these profligate wars and for the far-flung military bases that support them?
From 1950 to 1990, the superficial answer would have been the Cold War. Yet America?s imperial behavior overseas predates the Cold War by half a century (back to the Spanish-American War, in 1898) and has outlasted it by another quarter century. America?s overseas imperial adventures began after the Civil War and the final conquests of the Native American nations. At that point, US political and business leaders sought to join the European empires ? especially Britain, France, Russia, and the newly emergent Germany ? in overseas conquests. In short order, America grabbed the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Panama, and Hawaii, and joined the European imperial powers in knocking on the doors of China.
As of the 1890s, the United States was by far the world?s largest economy, but until World War II, it took a back seat to the British Empire in global naval power, imperial reach, and geopolitical dominance. The British were the unrivaled masters of regime change ? for example, in carving up the corpse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. Yet the exhaustion from two world wars and the Great Depression ended the British and French empires after World War II and thrust the United States and Russia into the forefront as the two main global empires. The Cold War had begun.
The economic underpinning of America?s global reach was unprecedented. As of 1950, US output constituted a remarkable 27 percent of global output, with the Soviet Union roughly a third of that, around 10 percent. The Cold War fed two fundamental ideas that would shape American foreign policy till now. The first was that the United States was in a struggle for survival against the Soviet empire. The second was that every country, no matter how remote, was a battlefield in that global war. While the United States and the Soviet Union would avoid a direct confrontation, they flexed their muscles in hot wars around the world that served as proxies for the superpower competition.
Over the course of nearly a half century, Cuba, Congo, Ghana, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Iran, Namibia, Mozambique, Chile, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and even tiny Granada, among many others, were interpreted by US strategists as battlegrounds with the Soviet empire. Often, far more prosaic interests were involved. Private companies like United Fruit International and ITT convinced friends in high places (most famously the Dulles brothers, Secretary of State John Foster and CIA director Allen) that land reforms or threatened expropriations of corporate assets were dire threats to US interests, and therefore in need of US-led regime change. Oil interests in the Middle East were another repeated cause of war, as had been the case for the British Empire from the 1920s.
These wars destabilized and impoverished the countries involved rather than settling the politics in America?s favor. The wars of regime change were, with few exceptions, a litany of foreign policy failure. They were also extraordinarily costly for the United States itself. The Vietnam War was of course the greatest of the debacles, so expensive, so bloody, and so controversial that it crowded out Lyndon Johnson?s other, far more important and promising war, the War on Poverty, in the United States.
The end of the Cold War, in 1991, should have been the occasion for a fundamental reorientation of US guns-versus-butter policies. The occasion offered the United States and the world a ?peace dividend,? the opportunity to reorient the world and US economy from war footing to sustainable development. Indeed, the Rio Earth Summit, in 1992, established sustainable development as the centerpiece of global cooperation, or so it seemed.
Alas, the blinders and arrogance of American imperial thinking prevented the United States from settling down to a new era of peace. As the Cold War was ending, the United States was beginning a new era of wars, this time in the Middle East. The United States would sweep away the Soviet-backed regimes in the Middle East and establish unrivalled US political dominance. Or at least that was the plan.
THE QUARTER CENTURY since 1991 has therefore been marked by a perpetual US war in the Middle East, one that has destabilized the region, massively diverted resources away from civilian needs toward the military, and helped to create mass budget deficits and the buildup of public debt. The imperial thinking has led to wars of regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Syria, across four presidencies: George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. The same thinking has induced the United States to expand NATO to Russia?s borders, despite the fact that NATO?s supposed purpose was to defend against an adversary ? the Soviet Union ? that no longer exists. Former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev has emphasized that eastward NATO expansion ?was certainly a violation of the spirit of those declarations and assurances that we were given in 1990,? regarding the future of East-West security.
There is a major economic difference, however, between now and 1991, much less 1950. At the start of the Cold War, in 1950, the United States produced around 27 percent of world output. As of 1991, when the Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz dreams of US dominance were taking shape, the United States accounted for around 22 percent of world production. By now, according to IMF estimates, the US share is 16 percent, while China has surpassed the United States, at around 18 percent. By 2021, according to projections by the International Monetary Fund, the United States will produce roughly 15 percent of global output compared with China?s 20 percent. The United States is incurring massive public debt and cutting back on urgent public investments at home in order to sustain a dysfunctional, militarized, and costly foreign policy.
Thus comes a fundamental choice. The United States can vainly continue the neoconservative project of unipolar dominance, even as the recent failures in the Middle East and America?s declining economic preeminence guarantee the ultimate failure of this imperial vision. If, as some neoconservatives support, the United States now engages in an arms race with China, we are bound to come up short in a decade or two, if not sooner. The costly wars in the Middle East ? even if continued much less enlarged in a Hillary Clinton presidency ? could easily end any realistic hopes for a new era of scaled-up federal investments in education, workforce training, infrastructure, science and technology, and the environment.
The far smarter approach will be to maintain America?s defensive capabilities but end its imperial pretensions. This, in practice, means cutting back on the far-flung network of military bases, ending wars of regime change, avoiding a new arms race (especially in next-generation nuclear weapons), and engaging China, India, Russia, and other regional powers in stepped-up diplomacy through the United Nations, especially through shared actions on the UN?s Sustainable Development Goals, including climate change, disease control, and global education.
Many American conservatives will sneer at the very thought that the United States? room for maneuver should be limited in the slightest by the UN. But think how much better off the United States would be today had it heeded the UN Security Council?s wise opposition to the wars of regime change in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. Many conservatives will point to Vladimir Putin?s actions in Crimea as proof that diplomacy with Russia is useless, without recognizing that it was NATO?s expansion to the Baltics and its 2008 invitation to Ukraine to join NATO, that was a primary trigger of Putin?s response.
In the end, the Soviet Union bankrupted itself through costly foreign adventures such as the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and its vast over-investment in the military. Today the United States has similarly over-invested in the military, and could follow a similar path to decline if it continues the wars in the Middle East and invites an arms race with China. It?s time to abandon the reveries, burdens, and self-deceptions of empire and to invest in sustainable development at home and in partnership with the rest of the world.

By James Petras
 Wall Street and the Pentagon greeted the onset of 2016 as a ?banner year?, a glorious turning point in the quest for malleable regimes willing to sell-off the most lucrative economic resources, to sign off on onerous new debt to Wall Street and to grant use of their strategic military bases to the Pentagon.
Brazil and Argentina, the most powerful and richest countries in South America and the Philippines, Washington?s most strategic military platform in Southeast Asia, were the objects of intense US political operations in the run-up to 2016.
In each instance, Wall Street and the Pentagon secured smashing successes leading to premature ejaculations over the ?new golden era? of financial pillage and unfettered military adventures. Unfortunately, the early ecstasy has turned to agony: Wall Street made easy entries and even faster departures once the ?honeymoon? gave way to reality. ; The political procurers persecuted center-left incumbents but, were soon to have their turn facing prosecution. The political prostitutes, who had decreed the sale of sovereignty, were replaced by nationalists who would turn the bordello back into a sovereign nation state.
This essay outlines the rapid rise and dramatic demise of these erstwhile ?progeny? of Wall Street and the Pentagon in Argentina and Brazil, and then reviews Washington?s shock and awe as the newly elected Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte embraced new ties with China while proclaiming, ?We are no one?s ?tuta? (puppy dog)!?
Argentina and Brazil: Grandiose Schemes and Crapulous Outcomes
The international financial press was ecstatic over the election of President Mauricio Macri in Argentina and the appointment of former Wall Street bankers to his cabinet. They celebrated the ouster of the ?evil populists?, accusing them of inflating economic results, reneging on debt obligations and discouraging foreign lenders and investors. Under the Macri regime all market obstacles were to be removed and all the bankers trembled with anticipation at the ?good times? to come.
After taking office in December 2015, President Macri unleashed the ?animal instincts? of the market and the carrion birds flocked in. US ?vulture funds? scooped up and demanded payment for on old Argentine debt ?valued? at $3.5 billion ? constituting a 1,000% return on their initial investment. A devaluation of the peso of 50% tripled inflation and drove down wages by 20%.
Firing over 200,000 public sector employees, slapping 400% price increases on utilities and transport, driving small and medium size firms into bankruptcy and enraged consumers into the streets ended the honeymoon with the Argentine electorate quite abruptly. This initial massive dose of free enterprise ?medicine? was prescribed by the local and Wall Street bankers and investors who had promised a new golden era for capitalism!
Now that he had banished the ?populists?, Macri was free to tap into the international financial markets. Argentina raised $16.5 billion from a bond sale taken up by the big bankers and speculators, mostly from Wall Street, who were eager to cash in on the high rates in the belief that there was no risk with their champion President Macri at the helm. Wall Street based its giddy predictions on a mere three-month experience with Mauricio!
But then some of the hedge fund managers began to raise questions about the viability of Mauricio Macri?s presidency. Instead of reducing the fiscal deficit, Macri began to increase public spending to offset mass discontent over his triple digit increases in utility fees and transportation, the mass layoffs in the public sector and the slashing of pension funds.
The major banks had counted on the abrupt devaluation of the currency to invest in the export sector, but instead they were confronted with a sudden 11% appreciation of the peso and a skyrocketing inflation of 40% leading to high interest rates. As a result, the economy fell even deeper in recession exceeding minus 3% for the year.
While most Wall Street bankers still retain some faith in the Macri regime, they are not willing to fork-over the kind of cash that might allow this increasingly unpopular regime to survive. What keep Wall Street on board the sinking ship are the political and ideological commitments rather than any objective assessment of their prot谷g谷e?s dismal economic performance. Wall Street counts on free market bankers appointed to the ministries, the massive purge of social services (health and education) personnel and the lucrative bond sales to cover the burgeoning deficit. They hope the vast increase in profits resulting from increased utility fees and the sharp cuts in salaries, pensions and subsidies will ultimately lead them into the promised land.
Wall Street has expressed dismay over Macri?s failure to stimulate growth ? in fact GDP is falling. Furthermore, their ?golden boy? failed to attract productive investments. Instead thousands of Argentine small and medium businesses have ?gone under? as consumer spending tanked and extortionate tariffs were slapped on vital public utilities and transport ? devastating profits. Inflation has undermined the purchasing power of the vast majority of households. Wall Street speculators, concentrating on fixed-rate peso denominated debt, are at risk of losing their shirts.
In other words, the administration?s ?free enterprise? regime is based largely on attracting foreign loans, plundering the national treasury, firing tens of thousands of public sector workers and slashing spending on social services and business-friendly subsidies. Macri has yet to generate any large-scale investment in new innovative productive sectors, which might sustain long-term growth.
Already facing growing discontent and a general strike of private and public sector workers, the ?bankers? regime? lacks the political links with the trade unions to neutralize the growing opposition.
To hold back the growing tidal wave of discontent, President Macri had to betray his overseas investors by boosting fiscal spending, which has had little or no impact on the national economy.
Wall Street?s hopes that President Mauricio Macri would inaugurate a ?golden era? of free market capitalism lasted less than a year and is turning into a real fiasco. Rising foreign debt, economic depression and class warfare ensures Macri?s rapid demise.
Brazil: Wall Street?s Three Month ?Whirl-Wind? Honeymoon
Most of the current elected members of the Brazilian Congress, Senate and the recently-installed (rather than elected) President, as well as his cabinet, are in trouble: The hero, Michael Temer and his argonauts, chosen by Wall Street to privatize the Brazilian economy and usher in another ?golden dawn? for finance capital, now all face criminal changes, arrest and long prison sentences for money laundering, bribery, fraud, tax evasion and corruption.
In less than four months, the entire political edifice constructed to impeach the elected President Dilma Rousseff and then de-nationalize key sectors of the economy, is shaking. So much for the financial press?s proclamation of a new era of ?business friendly? policies in Brazilia.
The pundits, politicians, journalists and editors, who prematurely celebrated the appointment of Michael Temer to the Presidency by legislative coup, now have to face a new reality. The key to understanding the rapid collapse of the New Right project in Brazil lies in the growing ?rap sheets? of the very same politicians who engineered the ouster of Rousseff.
Eduardo Cunha, the ex-president of the Congress in Brasilia, used his influence to ensure the super majority of Congressional votes for the impeachment. Cunha was godfather to ensuring the appointment of Michael Temer as interim president.
Cunha?s influence and control over the Congress was based on his wide network of bribes and corruption involving over a hundred members of congress, including the newly anointed President Temer.
Once Cunha secured the ouster of Rousseff, the Brazilian elite washed their collective hands of the ?fixer?, overwhelmed by the stench of his corruption. In September 2016, Cunha was suspended from Congress and lost his immunity. One month later, he was arrested on over a dozen charges, including fraud and tax evasion. It was public knowledge that Cunha had squirreled away a ?tidy nest? of over $70 million in Swiss banks.
Cunha directed (extorted) public and private firms to finance the campaigns of many of his political colleagues. He had intervened to secure bribes for President Temer, his foreign minister and even the next presidential hopeful, Jose Serra. One of the most powerful representatives of the new regime, Moreira Franco, Grand Wizard of the Privatization Program, was ?in hock? to Cunha.
As all this has come to light, Cunha has been negotiating a plea bargain with the prosecutor and judges in return for his ?singing? a few arias. He is facing over a hundred years in jail; his wife and daughter face trial; Eduardo Cunha is prepared to talk and finger political leaders to save his own neck. Most knowledgeable observers and judicial experts fully expect Cunha to bring down the Temer Administration with him and devastate the leadership of Temer?s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, as well as ex-president Fernando Henrique Cardoso?s Brazilian Social Democratic Party.
The Brazilian elite, Wall Street bankers and their mass media propagandists, who wrote and directed the impeachment plot scenario are now discredited and bereft of political front men. Their expectations of a new ?golden era of free market capitalism? in Brazil has turned into a political mad scramble with every politico and corporate leader desperate to save his own skin and illicit fortune by denouncing each other.
With the demise of the ?Brazilian takeover?, Wall Street and Washington are bereft of key markets and allies in Latin America.
The Philippines: The Duterte turn from the US to China
In April 2014, Washington ?secured? an agreement granting access to five strategic military bases in the Philippines critical to its ?pivot to target? China. Under the outgoing President ?Noynoy? Aquino, Jr. the Pentagon believed it had an ?iron-clad? agreement to organize the Philippines as its satrap and military springboard throughout Southeast Asia. Washington even prodded the Aquino government to bring its Spratly Island dispute with China before the obscure Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague. Washington anticipated using the Court?s ?favorable? ruling as a pretext to confront the Chinese.
All this has changed with the June 2016 ascent to the Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte: In only four months, all Washington?s imperial designs had been swept off the table. By October 21, 2016 President Duterte announced he would end military exercises with Washington because they threatened Philippine sovereignty and made his country vulnerable to a military confrontation with China. He promised to end sea patrols of disputed waters that the US uses to harass China in the South China Sea.
In advance of the Philippines President?s meeting with China, he had already declared that he would not press the Dutch-based ruling over the South China Sea island dispute against Beijing but rely on diplomacy and compromise. During the China meeting President Duterte declared that the two countries would engage in a constructive dialogue to resolve the Spratly Islands as well as other outstanding issues. The ?agreement? over US access to bases in the Philippines was put in doubt as the President declared ?a separation from the US? and promised long-term, large scale economic and investment ties with China. Undergirding the Philippines pivot to China were 13 trade and investment agreements worth more than $20 billion, covering financing of infrastructure, transport, social projects, tourism, industry and agriculture.
The military base agreement, signed by the notoriously servile ex-President Aquino without Congressional approval, was review by the Philippine Supreme Court and can be revoked by the new President Duterte by decree.
Inside of four months, the US strategy of armed encirclement and intervention against China has been dealt a major blow. The newly emerging China-Philippines linkage strikes a fatal blow to Washington?s overtly militarist ?pivot? against China.
Conclusion
2016 opened with great fanfare: The defeat of the two major center-left governments (Argentina and Brazil) and the advent of hard-right US-backed regimes would inaugurate a ?golden era of free market capitalism?. This promised to usher in a prolonged period of profit and pillage by rolling back ?populist? reforms and creating a bankers paradise. In Southeast Asia, US officials and pundits would proclaim another ?golden era?, this time of rampant militarism, encircling and provoking China on its vital sea lanes, and operating from five strategic military bases obtained through a Philippine Presidential decree by an unpopular and recently replaced puppet, ?Noynoy? Aquino, Jr.
These dreams of ?golden eras? lasted a few months before objective reality intruded.
By the autumn of 2016 the rightist regimes had been replaced in the Manila by a colorful ardent nationalist, while the ?banker boys? in Brasilia faced prison, and the ?Golden Boys? of Buenos Aires were mired in deep crisis. The notion of an easy Rightist restoration was based on several profound misunderstandings:
1) The belief that the reversal of social reforms and denial of popular demands would smoothly give way to an explosion of foreign financing and investment was shattered when private bond purchases profited the financial sector but did not bring in large-scale productive investment. Devaluation of the currency was followed by skyrocketing inflation, which led to fiscal deficits and the loss of business confidence.
2) Washington?s promotion of ?corruption investigations? started with prosecuting democratically elected center-left politicians and ended up with the arrest of Wall Street?s own prot谷g谷s encompassing the entire right-wing political class and decimating the ?Golden? regimes.
3) The belief that long-term hegemonic relations, based on client regimes in Asia, could resist the attraction of signing trade and investment agreements with the rising Chinese mega-economy, while sacrificing vital economic development, and relegating their masses to more stagnation and unemployment, collapsed with the massive electoral of nationalist Rodrigo Duterte as President of the Philippines.
In fact, these and other political assessments among the decision makers in Washington and on Wall Street were proven wrong leading to a strategic retreat of the empire in both Latin America and Asia. The policy failures were not merely ?mistakes? but the inevitable results of changing structural conditions embedded in a declining empire.
These decisions were based on a calculus of power, rooted in class and national relations that may have held true two decades ago. At the dawn of the new millennium the US still dominated Asia and China was not yet an economic alternative for its neighbors eager for investment. Washington could and did dictate policy in Southeast Asia.
Twenty years ago, the US had the economic leverage to sustain the neoliberal policies of the Washington Consensus throughout Latin America.
Today the US continues to pursue policies based on anachronistic power relations, seeming to ignore the fact that China is now a world power and a viable economic trade and investment alternative successfully competing for markets and influence in Asia. Washington is failing to compete in that marketplace and, therefore, can no longer rely on docile client state.
Washington cannot effectively control and direct large-scale capital flows to shore-up its newly installed rightist regimes in Argentina and Brazil as they crumble under their own corruption and incompetence. Meanwhile the world is watching a domestic US economy, mired in stagnation with its own political elites torn by corruption and scandals at the highest level, and staging the most bizarre presidential campaign in its history. Corruption has become the mode of governing under conditions of deregulation and rule by political warlords. Political allegiance to the empire and open doors to foreign pillage do not attract capital when those making political decisions are facing prison and the business ?doormen? are busy stuffing their suitcases with cash and making a mad-dash for the airports!
For Wall Street and the Pentagon, Latin America and Asia are lost opportunities ? betrayals to be mourned at the officers clubs and exclusive Manhattan restaurants. For the people in mass social movements these are emerging opportunities for struggle and change.
The strenuous US effort to rebuild its empire in Latin America and Southeast Asia has suffered a rapid succession of blows. Washington can still seize power but it lacks the talent and the favorable conditions to hold it.
The vision of a Brazilian state, build on the edifice of the privatized oil giant, Petrobras, and the political incarceration of its left adversaries, with foreign capital attracted and seduced by political procurers, pimps and prostitutes, has ended in a debacle.
In this vacuum, it will be up to the new governments and peoples? movements to seize the opportunity to advance their struggles and explore political and economic alternatives. The aborted rightist power grab inadvertently has done the peoples? movements a great favor by exposing and ousting the corrupt and compromised center-left regimes opening the door for a genuine anti-imperialist transformation.

November 09, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - Louis XVI needed a revolution, Napoleon needed two historic military defeats, the Spanish Empire in the New World needed multiple revolutions, the Russian Czar needed a communist revolution, the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires needed World War I, Nazi Germany needed World War II, Imperial Japan needed two atomic bombs, the Portuguese Empire in Africa needed a military coup at home, the Soviet Empire needed Mikhail Gorbachev What will the American Empire need?
?I don?t believe anyone will consciously launch World War III. The situation now is more like the eve of World War I, when great powers were armed and ready to go when an incident set things off. Ever since Gorbachev naively ended the Cold War, the hugely over-armed United States has been actively surrounding Russia with weapons systems, aggressive military exercises, NATO expansion. At the same time, in recent years the demonization of Vladimir Putin has reached war propaganda levels. Russians have every reason to believe that the United States is preparing for war against them, and are certain to take defensive measures. This mixture of excessive military preparations and propaganda against an ?evil enemy? make it very easy for some trivial incident to blow it all up.? ? Diana Johnstone, author of ?Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton?
In September 2013 President Obama stood before the United Nations General Assembly and declared, ?I believe America is exceptional.? The following year at the UN, the president classified Russia as one of the three threats to the world along with the Islamic State and the ebola virus. On March 9, 2015 President Barack Obama declared Venezuela ?an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States?.
Vladimir Putin, speaking at the UN in 2015, addressing the United States re its foreign policy: ?Do you realize what you have done??
Since the end of World War 2, the United States has:
Attempted to overthrow more than 50 foreign governments, most of which were democratically-elected. Dropped bombs on the people of more than 30 countries. Attempted to assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders. Attempted to suppress a populist or nationalist movement in 20 countries. Grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries.* Plus although not easily quantified has been more involved in the practice of torture than any other country in the world for over a century not just performing the actual torture, but teaching it, providing the manuals, and furnishing the equipment. *See chapter 18 of William Blum, ?Rogue State: A Guide to the World?s Only Superpower?
On October 28, 2016 Russia was voted off the UN Human Rights Council. At the same time Saudi Arabia won a second term, uncontested. Does anyone know George Orwell?s email address?
A million refugee from Washington?s warfare are currently over-running Europe. They?re running from Afghanistan and Iraq; from Libya and Somalia; from Syria and Pakistan.
Germany is taking in many Syrian refugees because of its World War Two guilt. What will the United States do in the future because of its guilt? But Americans are not raised to feel such guilt.
?The Plan is for the United States to rule the world. The overt theme is unilateralism, but it is ultimately a story of domination. It calls for the United States to maintain its overwhelming superiority and prevent new rivals from rising up to challenge it on the world stage. It calls for dominion over friends and enemies alike. It says not that the United States must be more powerful, or most powerful, but that it must be absolutely powerful.? Vice-President Dick Cheney ? West Point lecture, June 2002
Two flew over the cuckoo?s nest: ?We are, as a matter of empirical fact and undeniable history, the greatest force for good the world has ever known. security and freedom for millions of people around the globe have depended on America?s military , economic, political, and diplomatic might.? ? Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney, ?Why the world needs a powerful America? (2015)
State Department spokesperson Mark Toner: ?Assad must go even if Syria goes with him.?
Many of the moves the Obama administration has made in terms of its Cuba policy are in lockstep with Bill Clinton?s, as expressed in the recommendations of a 1999 task force report from the Council on Foreign Relations. The report asserted that ?no change in policy should have the primary effect of consolidating, or appearing to legitimize, the political status quo on the island.?
A successful American regime change operation in Syria would cut across definite interests of the Russian state. These include the likely use of Syria as a new pipeline route to bring gas from Qatar to the European market, thereby undercutting Gazprom, Russia?s largest corporation and biggest exporter. Assad?s refusal to consider such a route played no small role in Qatar?s pouring billions of dollars in arms and funds into the Syrian civil war on behalf of anti-Assad forces.
?War with Russia will be nuclear. Washington has prepared for it. Washington has abandoned the ABM treaty, created what it thinks is an ABM shield, and changed its war doctrine to permit US nuclear first strike. All of this is obviously directed at Russia, and the Russian government knows it. How long will Russia sit there waiting for Washington?s first strike?? ? Paul Craig Roberts, 2014
Iran signed the nuclear accords with the United States earlier this year by agreeing to stop what it never was doing. Any Iranian nuclear ambition, real or imagined, is of course a result of American hostility towards Iran, and not the other way around.
If the European Union were an independent and rational government it would absolutely forbid any member country from stockpiling American nuclear weapons or hosting a US anti-ballistic missile site or any other military base anywhere close to Russia?s borders.
Full Spectrum Dominance, a term the Pentagon loves to use to refer to total control of the planet: land, sea, air, space, outer space and cyberspace. Can you imagine any other country speaking this way?
Henry Kissinger at the Paris Peace Talks, September 1970. ?I refuse to believe that a little fourth rate power like North Vietnam does not have a breaking point.?
In 2010, WikiLeaks released a cable sent to US embassies by then- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She wrote this: ?Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, al Nusra and other terrorist groups worldwide.? Surely this resulted in at least Washington?s much-favored weapon: sanctions of various kinds. It did not.
US General Barry McCaffrey, April 2015: ?Because so far NATO?s reaction to Putin?s aggression has been to send a handful of forces to the Baltics to demonstrate ?resolve,? which has only convinced Putin that the alliance is either unable or unwilling to fight. So we had better change his calculus pretty soon, and contest Putin?s stated doctrine that he is willing to intervene militarily in other countries to ?protect? Russia-speaking people. For God?s sake, the last time we heard that was just before Hitler invaded the Sudetenland.?
 No, my dear general, we heard that repeatedly in 1983 when the United States invaded the tiny nation of Grenada to protect and rescue hundreds of Americans who supposedly were in danger from the new leftist government. It was all a fraud, no more than an excuse to overthrow a government that that didn?t believe that the American Empire was God?s gift to humanity.
Since 1980, the United States has intervened in the affairs of fourteen Muslim countries, at worst invading or bombing them. They are (in chronological order) Iran, Libya, Lebanon, Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo, Yemen, Pakistan, and now Syria.
How our never-ending mideast horror began: Radio Address of George W. Bush, September 28, 2002: ?The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, is rebuilding the facilities to make more and, according to the British government, could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given. The regime has long-standing and continuing ties to terrorist groups, and there are al Qaeda terrorists inside Iraq. This regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, and with fissile material could build one within a year.? Yet just six weeks before 9/11, Condoleezza Rice told CNN: ?Let?s remember that his [Saddam?s] country is divided, in effect. He does not control the northern part of his country. We are able to keep his arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt.?
The fact is that there is more participation by the Cuban population in the running of their country than there is by the American population in the running of theirs. One important reason is the absence of the numerous private corporations which, in the United States, exert great influence over all aspects of life.
?The U.S. is frantically surrounding China with military weapons, advanced aircraft, naval fleets and a multitude of military bases from Japan, South Korea and the Philippines through several nearby smaller Pacific islands to its new and enlarged base in Australia The U.S. naval fleet, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines patrol China?s nearby waters. Warplanes, surveillance planes, drones and spying satellites cover the skies, creating a symbolic darkness at noon.? (Jack A. Smith, ?Hegemony Games: USA vs. PRC?, CounterPunch)
Crimea had never voluntarily left Russia. The USSR?s leader Nikita Khrushchev, a native of the region, had donated Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Crimeans were always strongly opposed to that change and voted overwhelmingly to rejoin Russia after the US-induced Ukrainian coup in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin refers to the Ukrainian army as ?NATO?s foreign legion?, which does not pursue Ukraine?s national interests. The United States, however, insists on labeling the Russian action in Crimea as an invasion.
Putin re Crimea/Ukraine: ?Our western partners created the ?Kosovo precedent? with their own hands. In a situation absolutely the same as the one in Crimea they recognized Kosovo?s secession from Serbia legitimate while arguing that no permission from a country?s central authority for a unilateral declaration of independence is necessary And the UN International Court of Justice agreed with those arguments. That?s what they said; that?s what they trumpeted all over the world and coerced everyone to accept ? and now they are complaining about Crimea. Why is that??
Paul Craig Roberts: ?The absurdity of it all! Even a moron knows that if Russia is going to put tanks and troops into Ukraine, Russia will put in enough to do the job. The war would be over in a few days if not in a few hours. As Putin himself said some months ago, if the Russian military enters Ukraine, the news will not be the fate of Donetsk or Mauriupol, but the fall of Kiev and Lviv.?
In a major examination of US policy vis-?-vis China, published in March 2015, the authoritative Council on Foreign Relations bluntly declared that ?there is no real prospect of building fundamental trust, ?peaceful coexistence,? ?mutual understanding,? a strategic partnership, or a ?new type of major country relations? between the United States and China.? The United States, the report declares, must, therefore, develop ?the political will? and military capabilities ?to deal with China to protect vital U.S. interests.?
?John F. Kennedy changed the mission of the Latin American military from ?hemispheric defense? ? an outdated relic of World War II ? to ?internal security,? which means war against the domestic population.? ? Noam Chomsky
Cuban baseball players who are paid a million dollars to play for an American team are not ?defectors?, a word which has a clear political connotation.
Boris Yeltsin was acceptable to American and Europeans because he was seen as a weak, pliable figure that allowed Western capital free rein in the newly opened Russian territory following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin?s era was also a time of rampant corruption by Russian oligarchs who were closely associated with Western capital. That corrosive culture came to a halt with the election of Vladimir Putin twice as president between 2000-2008, and again in 2012.
Many ISIS leaders were former Iraqi military officers who were imprisoned by American troops. The fight isn?t against ISIS, it?s against Assad; at the next level it isn?t against Assad, it?s against Putin; then, at the next level, it isn?t against Putin, it?s against the country most likely to stand in the way of US world domination, Russia. And it?s forever.
Connecting to the US-based Internet would mean channeling all of Cuba?s communications directly to the NSA.
George W. Bush has been living a comparatively quiet life in Texas, with a focus on his paintings. ?I?m trying to leave something behind?, he said a couple of years ago. Yeah, right, George. We can stand up some of the paintings against the large piles of Iraqi dead bodies.
Seymour Hersh: ?America would be much better off, if, 30 years ago, we had let Russia continue its war in Afghanistan The mistake was made by the Carter administration which was trying to stop the Russians from their invasion of Afghanistan. We?d be better off had we let the Russians beat the Taliban.? ( Deutsche Welle , April 2, 2014 interview) We?d be even better off if we hadn?t overthrown the progressive, secular Afghan government, giving rise to the Taliban in the first place and inciting the Russians to intervene on their border lest the Soviet Islamic population was stirred up.
The former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in an interview in 1998 summed up exactly what the US thinks of the UN: ?The UN plays a very important role. But if we don?t like it, we always have the option of following our own national security interests, which I assure you we will do if we don?t like what?s going on.? She is now a foreign-policy advisor to Hillary Clinton.
?A leader taking his (or her) nation to war is as dysfunctional in the family of humankind as an abusive parent is in an individual family.? ? Suzy Kane
?It would be some time before I fully realized that the United States sees little need for diplomacy. Power is enough. Only the weak rely on diplomacy The Roman Empire had no need for diplomacy. Nor does the United States.? ? Boutros Boutros-Ghali , Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1992 to December 1996
?Interventions are not against dictators but against those who try to distribute: not against Jim谷nez in Venezuela but Ch芍vez, not against Somoza in Nicaragua but the Sandinistas, not against Batista in Cuba but Castro, not against Pinochet in Chile but Allende, not against Guatemala dictators but Arbenz, not against the shah in Iran but Mossadegh, etc.? ? Johan Galtung, Norwegian, principal founder of the discipline of peace and conflict studies
?No mention was made that Iraq?s Christians had been safe and sound under President Saddam Hussein ? even privileged ? until President George Bush invaded and destroyed Iraq. We can expect the same fate for Syria?s Christians if the protection of the Assad regime is torn away by the US-engineered uprising. We will then shed crocodile tears for Syria?s Christians.? ? Eric Margolis, 2014
?Jewish Power is the capacity to silence the debate on Jewish Power.? ? Gilad Atzmon
?We need a trial to judge all those who bear significant responsibility for the past century - the most murderous and ecologically destructive in human history. We could call it the war, air and fiscal crimes tribunal and we could put politicians and CEOs and major media owners in the dock with earphones like Eichmann and make them listen to the evidence of how they killed millions of people and almost murdered the planet and made most of us far more miserable than we needed to be. Of course, we wouldn?t have time to go after them one by one. We?d have to lump Wall Street investment bankers in one trial, the Council on Foreign Relations in another, and any remaining Harvard Business School or Yale Law graduates in a third. We don?t need this for retribution, only for edification. So there would be no capital punishment, but rather banishment to an overseas Nike factory with a vow of perpetual silence.? ? Sam Smith
?I have come to think of the export of ?democracy? as the contemporary equivalent of what missionaries have always done in the interest of conquering and occupying the ?uncivilized? world on behalf of the powers that be. I have said that the ?church? invented the concept of conversion by any means, including torture and killing of course, as doing the victims a big favor, since it was in the interest of ?saving? their immortal souls. It is now called, ?democratization?.? ? Rita Corriel
?It is more or less impossible to commemorate the war dead without glorifying them, and it is impossible to glorify them without glorifying their wars.? ? Paul Craig Roberts

In the past week, Burundi and South Africa have joined Namibia in declaring their intention to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). They are likely to be followed by a parade of other African countries, jeopardizing the future of an international court that has prosecuted 39 officials from eight African countries but has failed to indict a single person who is not African. 
Ironically, African countries were among the first to embrace the ICC, so it is a striking turnaround that they are now the first to give up on it. 
But it is the United States that has played the leading role in preventing the ICC from fulfilling the universal mandate for which it was formed, to hold officials of all countries accountable for the worst crimes in the world: genocide; crimes against humanity; and war crimes〞not least the crime of international aggression, which the judges at Nuremberg defined as ※the supreme international crime§ from which all other war crimes follow. 
As the ICC＊s founding father, former Nuremberg prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz, lamented in 2011 , ※You don＊t have to be a criminologist to realize that if you want to deter a crime, you must persuade potential criminals that, if they commit crimes, they will be hauled into court and be held accountable. It is the policy of the United States to do just the opposite as far as the crime of aggression is concerned. Our government has gone to great pains to be sure that no American will be tried by any international criminal court for the supreme crime of illegal war-making.§ 
The U.S. has not only refused to accept the jurisdiction of the ICC over its own citizens. It has gone further, pressuring other countries to sign Bilateral Immunity Agreements (BIA), in which they renounce the right to refer U.S. citizens to the ICC for war crimes committed on their territory. 
The U.S. has also threatened to cut off U.S. aid to countries that refuse to sign them. The BIAs violate those countries＊ own commitments under the ICC statute, and the U.S. pressure to sign them has been rightly condemned as an outrageous effort to ensure impunity for U.S. war crimes. 
Resistance to U.S. impunity 
To the credit of our international neighbors, this U.S. strategy has met with substantial resistance. The European Parliament overwhelmingly passed a resolution stating that BIAs are incompatible with E.U. membership, and urged E.U. member states and countries seeking E.U. membership not to sign them. 
Fifty-four countries have publicly refused to sign BIAs , and 24 have accepted cut-offs of U.S. aid as a consequence of their refusal. Of 102 countries that have signed a BIA , only 48 are members of the ICC in any case, and only 15 of those countries are on record as having ratified the BIAs in their own parliaments. 
Thirty-two other ICC members have apparently allowed BIAs to take effect without parliamentary ratification, but this has been challenged by their own country＊s legal experts in many cases. 
The U.S. campaign to undermine the ICC is part of a much broader effort by the U.S. government to evade all forms of accountability under the laws that are supposed to govern international behavior in the modern world, even as it continues to masquerade as a global champion of the rule of law. 
The treaties that U.S. policy systematically violates today were crafted by American statesmen and diplomats, working with their foreign colleagues, to build a world where all people would enjoy some basic protections from the worst atrocities, instead of being subject only to the law of the jungle or ※might makes right.§ 
U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and other multilateral treaties that our country ignores, violates or refuses to ratify.

Seitz went on to serve as Assistant Secretary of State, U.S. Ambassador to the U.K., and then vice-chairman of Lehman Brothers. 
nducted throughout the world. It was never-ending. And it is as if it never happened. 
※The United States supported and in many cases engendered every right-wing military dictatorship in the world after the end of the Second World War. I refer to Indonesia, Greece, Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Haiti, Turkey, the Philippines, Guatemala, El Salvador, and, of course, Chile. The horror the United States inflicted upon Chile in 1973 can never be purged and can never be forgiven. 
※Hundreds of thousands of deaths took place throughout these countries. Did they take place? And are they in all cases attributable to US foreign policy? The answer is yes they did take place and they are attributable to American foreign policy. But you wouldn＊t know it. 
※It never happened. Nothing ever happened. Even while it was happening it wasn＊t happening. It didn＊t matter. It was of no interest. The crimes of the United States have been systematic, constant, vicious, remorseless, but very few people have actually talked about them. You have to hand it to America. It has exercised a quite clinical manipulation of power worldwide while masquerading as a force for universal good. It＊s a brilliant, even witty, highly successful act of hypnosis.§ 
If in 2016 the world seems to be more violent and chaotic than ever, it is not because the United States lacks the will to use force or project power, as both major party candidates for president and their military advisers appear to believe, but because our leaders have placed too much stock in the illegal threat and use of force and have lost faith in the rule of law, international cooperation and diplomacy. 
After a century of commercial dominance, and 75 years of investing disproportionately in weapons, military forces and geopolitical schemes, perhaps it is understandable that U.S. leaders have forgotten how to deal fairly and respectfully with our international neighbors. But it is no longer an option to muddle along, leaving a trail of death, ruin and chaos in our wake, counting on an elaborate propaganda machine to minimize the blowback on our country and our lives. 
Sooner rather than later, Americans and our leaders must knuckle down and master the very different attitudes and skills we will need to become law-abiding global citizens in a peaceful, sustainable, multipolar world.

The True Flag: Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Twain, and the Birth of the American Empire By Stephen Kinzer Henry Holt and Company, New York. 2017 
The American empire is usually not spoken of as such within today＊s current mainstream media discussions, but is generally recognized as such during infrequent candid moments, and within discussions in much of the alternate media. The discussion is not new, and the factors within the discussion, while changing somewhat with the times, tend to have remained the same. Stephen Kinzer＊s illustrative new history, The True Flag, takes the reader back to the turn of the Twentieth Century when the first acts of overseas empire were argued and acted on. 
It can be argued that ＆empire＊ starts with the first movement across the continent by the new United States, incorporating, by various means, Florida, the Louisiana Purchase, the northern half of Mexican territory, and the lands of the native population. Kinzer acknowledges all that indirectly, as do some of the characters in the history, but his focus is on the pivotal years of 1898 to 1901 when the arguments concerning overseas territories focused on the Spanish empire in Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and the then sovereign state of Hawaii. 
The writing is history at its best. Kinzer writes an interesting history with a casual anecdotal style of reading rather than the more common dry textbook style. While doing so the reader receives a sense of the actual personality and characteristics of each person within the narrative. As the story unwinds, these personality traits become as important as the actual facts of what happened, the latter having devolved form each individual＊s interests and intentions. 
The title highlights Roosevelt and Mark Twain as the prime protagonist/antagonist pair. The history itself presents a significant group on either side: McKinley, Hearst, Lodge, and Roosevelt promoting empire; Hoar, Carnegie, Bryan, and Twain opposing the annexation/conquest of overseas territories. Many other characters come into play, but his group displays the personal characteristics that helped shape the overall argument. 
The themes of the arguments are surprisingly familiar to contemporary empire critics. 
The racist nature of U.S. endeavours runs throughout the discussion, ranging from the idea of ※benevolent assimilation§ allowing the ※blessings of good and stable government . . . under the free flag of the United States [McKinley],§ to ※the misguided Filipino [McKinley],§ but more strongly worded in the sanctimonious terms of ※savage tribes [Roosevelt]§ and from the military commander in the Philippines, a people ※in the childhood stage of race development.§ 
Sound familiar to today＊s rhetoric? So do the underlying rationalizations and apologetics for empire. The Filipinos ※shall for ages hence bless the American republic,§ for their ※emancipation§ not just from another empire but from the ※arrogant rule of a native dictator.§ On the other hand, when the fighting became bloody and fierce, the insurrection fighters were attacked as ※They assailed our sovereignty [McKinley〞again],§ while the anti-imperialists at home became ※complicit in the killing of U.S. soldiers [Roosevelt].§ Rally ＆round the flag boys. 
Other current themes run through the works. The ideas of the U.S. as a moral nation collided with the now consistent idea that ※it was foolish to dwell on constitutional niceties when vital interests were concerned.§ The concept of forceful morality came into play as it does today. Mckinley argued, Forcible intervention of the United States as a neutral to stop the war [would be] in the cause of humanity.§ The imperialists in general ※considered war purifying,§ and ※In their imagined future, humanity would be guided by a virtuous United States and disciplined by American military power.§ Sounds like something out of our contemporary Thomas Friedman and his ※hidden fist.§ 
The reality underlying most of the rhetoric was markets, resources, and profits, much as it is today with the U.S. concern for maintaining its petrodollar hegemony. With the U.S. in an economic downturn, and millions unemployed (still familiar?) the imperialists argued that ※commerce would have to be protected, or imposed on unwilling nations by naval power . . . [fusing] America＊s commercial and strategic interests into a global strategy.§ Empire would create ※outlets for the surplus§ and guarantee America＊s ※commercial supremacy.§ Cuba was already mostly owned by fruit and sugar farmers, and the Philippines represented a market of 10 million citizens who would be educated to the U.S. manner of consumption and also would serve as a stepping stone into Asian markets. 
The anti-empire people obviously lost the argument〞perhaps not the argument, but certainly the reality. Their central focus was the adverse effects overseas acquisitions would have on the very nature of the Republic that would eventually lead to its decline and its dislike and distrust by much of the world. In that sense, yes, they won the argument, but not the reality. 
Similar to his other works, Stephen Kinzer presents an easily readable, entertaining, and informative history of these important years. The True Flag is an important addition to not only understanding this particular time of imperial expansion, but also as a basis for understanding most of the subsequent events leading up to today＊s aggrandizing imperial rhetoric〞it is not new.

Our world is on the cusp of a new era. Traditional taboos are being smashed. Respect has become an old-fashioned word. Nothing is too low or too dirty to be ignored, overlooked or even applauded by some. 
The rise of antiestablishment popularism plays to the lowest common denominator and is potentially divisive and corrosive of values held dear for generations. We＊ve witnessed how a populist candidate spouting what he imagines the struggling sectors want to hear has not only lowered the tone but has dragged many of his supporters and rivals down to the same level. 
The American political sphere has turned into a swamp of muckraking, hatred of the other and threats of violence to the extent that white supremacist militias are preparing to attack African Americans if their candidate doesn＊t make the White House. 
It＊s suddenly okay for the son of one to announce the former head of the Ku Klux Klan ※desperately needs a bullet in the head.§ What happened to judicial process? On the other hand Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton cynically attempted to woo African Americans by appearing on the stage with her new buddies, celebrity black rappers. 
Robert de Niro＊s video urging voters not to support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, adding he would love to punch him in the face went viral. Trump supporters claim they are a ＆movement＊ and threaten revolution if he fails to win an election they believe may be ＆rigged.＊ Republicans anxious to keep their grip on Congress have threatened to block Clinton＊s initiatives at every turn. 
Even the feuding Justice Department and the FBI aren＊t exempt from the ire. Both are being hit by accusations of interfering in the political process. The country that＊s stood as the greatest example of democracy and the rule of law is gradually embracing the law of the jungle. I＊m amazed that most Americans see nothing amiss about their president, his wife and his vice-president spending days stumping for their candidate. Isn＊t a US president supposed to represent all Americans? 
There are echoes within the UK where politicians still quarrel over the validity of a referendum over Britain＊s exit from the EU. The High Court＊s judgment to the effect that the prime minister doesn＊t have the authority to take the country out without a parliamentary vote has resulted in media attacks on judges whose reputations were formerly unassailable. I may be wrong but I don＊t recall such venom directed at the judiciary throughout my lifetime. 
Tabloid headlines scream ※Who do you think you are? ※The judges versus the people§ and the Daily Mail has gone as far as to post photographs of three judges referring to them as ※Enemies of the People,§ describing one as being ※openly gay.§ This is nothing short of an attack on democracy＊s checks and balances. 
The High Court has pronounced on a legal point, not on the pros and cons of Brexit. The government has the right to appeal in the Supreme Court but UK Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated she will proceed with triggering Article 50 come what may. 
Charles Falconer writing in The Guardian was right to assert ※the judiciary is a vital pillar of our constitution. The government must defend it from these unconscionable attacks〞or put all our freedoms at risk.§ 
Gina Miller, an activist who lodged the legal challenge is now receiving online death threats! Britons posting on Facebook have called for her ※to be shot or hung.§ 
Populist leaders tap in to people＊s basest instincts. They are not reliant on knowledge of how the world works or of experience but rather on personal charisma and the power of persuasion. They inspire devoted followings blind to their transgressions which gives them a sense of power and infallibility. 
We＊ve seen the rise of rank outsiders in the Philippines and Indonesia whose rhetoric and policies defy all norms. 
This ＆anything goes＊ trend fuelled by fear and economic grievances is a slippery slope reminiscent of Germany in the early 1930s when Hitler wasn＊t viewed as the monster he was but as a saviour from a brutal economic depression resulting in worthless currency and unemployment in the millions. He mesmerised crowds as he vowed to make Germany strong again. Perhaps it＊s time that lessons were learnt before there＊s no going back.

Louis XVI needed a revolution; Napoleon needed two historic military defeats; the Spanish Empire in the New World needed multiple revolutions; the Russian Czar needed a communist revolution; the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empire needed World War I; Nazi Germany needed World War II; Imperial Japan needed two atomic bombs; the Portuguese Empire in Africa needed a military coup at home; the Soviet Empire needed Mikhail Gorbachev . . . What will the American Empire need? 
※I don＊t believe anyone will consciously launch World War III. The situation now is more like the eve of World War I, when great powers were armed and ready to go when an incident set things off. Ever since Gorbachev naively ended the Cold War, the hugely over-armed United States has been actively surrounding Russia with weapons systems, aggressive military exercises, NATO expansion. At the same time, in recent years the demonization of Vladimir Putin has reached war propaganda levels. Russians have every reason to believe that the United States is preparing for war against them, and are certain to take defensive measures. This mixture of excessive military preparations and propaganda against an ※evil enemy§ make it very easy for some trivial incident to blow it all up.§〞 Diana Johnstone, author of ※Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton§ 
In September 2013 President Obama stood before the United Nations General Assembly and declared, ※I believe America is exceptional.§ The following year at the UN, the president classified Russia as one of the three threats to the world along with the Islamic State and the ebola virus. On March 9, 2015 President Barack Obama declared Venezuela ※an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.§

It calls for the United States to maintain its overwhelming superiority and prevent new rivals from rising up to challenge it on the world stage. It calls for dominion over friends and enemies alike. It says not that the United States must be more powerful, or most powerful, but that it must be absolutely powerful.§ 
Two flew over the cuckoo＊s nest: ※We are, as a matter of empirical fact and undeniable history, the greatest force for good the world has ever known. . . . security and freedom for millions of people around the globe have depended on America＊s military , economic, political, and diplomatic might.§〞 
※War with Russia will be nuclear. Washington has prepared for it. Washington has abandoned the ABM treaty, created what it thinks is an ABM shield, and changed its war doctrine to permit US nuclear first strike.

US General Barry McCaffrey, April 2015: ※Because so far NATO＊s reaction to Putin＊s aggression has been to send a handful of forces to the Baltics to demonstrate ＆resolve,＊ which has only convinced Putin that the alliance is either unable or unwilling to fight. So we had better change his calculus pretty soon, and contest Putin＊s stated doctrine that he is willing to intervene militarily in other countries to ＆protect＊ Russia-speaking people. For God＊s sake, the last time we heard that was just before Hitler invaded the Sudetenland.§ No, my dear general, we heard that repeatedly in 1983 when the United States invaded the tiny nation of Grenada to protect and rescue hundreds of Americans who supposedly were in danger from the new leftist government. It was all a fraud, no more than an excuse to overthrow a government that that didn＊t believe that the American Empire was God＊s gift to humanity. 
Since 1980, the United States has intervened in the affairs of fourteen Muslim countries, at worst invading or bombing them. They are (in chronological order) Iran, Libya, Lebanon, Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo, Yemen, Pakistan, and now Syria. 
How our never-ending Mideast horror began: Radio Address of George W. Bush, September 28, 2002: ※The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, is rebuilding the facilities to make more and, according to the British government, could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given. The regime has long-standing and continuing ties to terrorist groups, and there are al Qaeda terrorists inside Iraq. This regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, and with fissile material could build one within a year.§ Yet . . . just six weeks before 9/11, Condoleezza Rice told CNN: ※Let＊s remember that his [Saddam＊s] country is divided, in effect. He does not control the northern part of his country. We are able to keep his arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt.§ 
The fact is that there is more participation by the Cuban population in the running of their country than there is by the American population in the running of theirs. One important reason is the absence of the numerous private corporations which, in the United States, exert great influence over all aspects of life. 
※The U.S. is frantically surrounding China with military weapons, advanced aircraft, naval fleets and a multitude of military bases from Japan, South Korea and the Philippines through several nearby smaller Pacific islands to its new and enlarged base in Australia . . . The U.S. naval fleet, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines patrol China＊s nearby waters. Warplanes, surveillance planes, drones and spying satellites cover the skies, creating a symbolic darkness at noon.§ (Jack A. Smith, ※Hegemony Games: USA vs. PRC,§ CounterPunch) 
SR＊s leader Nikita Khrushchev, a native of the region, had donated Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Crimeans were always strongly opposed to that change and voted overwhelmingly to rejoin Russia after the US-induced Ukrainian coup in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin refers to the Ukrainian army as ※NATO＊s foreign legion,§ which does not pursue Ukraine＊s national interests. The United States, however, insists on labeling the Russian action in Crimea as an invasion. 
Putin re Crimea/Ukraine: ※Our western partners created the ＆Kosovo precedent＊ with their own hands. In a situation absolutely the same as the one in Crimea they recognized Kosovo＊s secession from Serbia legitimate while arguing that no permission from a country＊s central authority for a unilateral declaration of independence is necessary . . . And the UN International Court of Justice agreed with those arguments. That＊s what they said; that＊s what they trumpeted all over the world and coerced everyone to accept〞and now they are complaining about Crimea. Why is that?§ 
Paul Craig Roberts: ※The absurdity of it all! Even a moron knows that if Russia is going to put tanks and troops into Ukraine, Russia will put in enough to do the job. The war would be over in a few days if not in a few hours. As Putin himself said some months ago, if the Russian military enters Ukraine, the news will not be the fate of Donetsk or Mauriupol, but the fall of Kiev and Lviv.§ 
In a major examination of US policy vis-角-vis China, published in March 2015, the authoritative Council on Foreign Relations bluntly declared that ※there is no real prospect of building fundamental trust, ＆peaceful coexistence,＊ ＆mutual understanding,＊ a strategic partnership, or a ＆new type of major country relations＊ between the United States and China.§ The United States, the report declares, must, therefore, develop ※the political will§ and military capabilities ※to deal with China to protect vital U.S. interests.§

Boris Yeltsin was acceptable to American and Europeans because he was seen as a weak, pliable figure that allowed Western capital free rein in the newly opened Russian territory following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin＊s era was also a time of rampant corruption by Russian oligarchs who were closely associated with Western capital. That corrosive culture came to a halt with the election of Vladimir Putin twice as president between 2000每2008, and again in 2012. 
Many ISIS leaders were former Iraqi military officers who were imprisoned by American troops.

The former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in an interview in 1998 summed up exactly what the US thinks of the UN: ※The UN plays a very important role.

China＊s state-run media has been inundated with rant on the subject of their military and sway. China＊s Global Times ventured to test Australia specifically, saying: ※If Australia ventures into the South China Sea waters, it will be a perfect focus for China to caution and strike.§ 
On Weibo, a state-controlled blogging website, Lian Fang, a teacher at the military 每run National Defense University said that ※The Chinese military will venture up hard and China will never submit to any nation on matters of sway,§ 
Wanquan apparently put forth the expression while investigating army bases in China＊s eastern beach front region of Zhejiang. The Defense Minister said the Chinese open ought to be instructed about national protection issues in light of the fact that the nation＊s power and its regional uprightness are at danger. 
Wanquan additionally cautioned of seaward security dangers, and the need to recognize the gravity of danger to China＊s national security. He promote charged the whole security device of the nation, including military, police, together with subjects to get ready for assembly to protect their national sway and regional respectability. 
Pundits likewise trust that China has a solid conviction that the United States actuated the Philippines to question the South China Sea so that the United States could exploit and adventure the territory for its advantage. 
The Free Thought Project affirms that several boats and submarines from every one of the three armadas of China＊s People＊s Liberation Army directed broad live ammo drills in the nation＊s East, North, and South Seas as a show of hostile and protective capacities. 
A war amongst China and its neighbors additionally has the risky probability to separate the world. The U.S. will most likely go to the guide of its partners, and China and Russia have expanded military ties which could assist muddle the situation.

A perfect example of this is unfolding in the dramatic unraveling of US-Philippine relations where any and every means of finding leverage over Washington＊s wayward ally is being brought to bear on Manila. The most recent manifestation of this occurred when the US blocked the shipment of US rifles destined for the Philippines＊ police forces. PhilStar Global＊s article, ※ Duterte cancels rifle sale blocked by US over rights concerns ,§ would report that: The US State Department had earlier halted the sale of about 26,000 rifles to the Philippines when US Sen. Ben Cardin said that he will oppose it due to concerns over human right violations attributed to the government＊s war on drugs. At face value, and ignoring any wider context, it would appear that the United States took a moral stand on what would have otherwise been a lucrative arms deal and would have helped draw Washington and Manila closer together politically. However, zooming out slightly from Manila, the situation in Asia Pacific finds the US being incrementally pushed out of the region as a geopolitical power broker. As nations, including the Philippines rebuff the United States and its attempts to reassert itself vis-角-vis China, Washington has resorted to leveraging human rights issues, economic pressure and even covert political and military pressure to maintain its grip on each respective nation in the region. Putting pressure on Manila through a humiliating political stunt, not adhering to moral convictions, is the primary factor driving Washington＊s decision to block its own delivery of weapons to the Philippines＊ police forces. And beyond simply identifying the true motive of America＊s recent stunt, there is the matter of overt hypocrisy to account for. Philippines Denied Rifles, Saudis Given Tanks, Warplanes and Bombs While the US poses as morally bound to block its weapons deal with the Philippines, it continues to supply the nation of Saudi Arabia with billions of dollars of advanced weaponry, including air-delivered munitions, warplanes and main battle tanks. In fact, according to the Guardian , in 2010 the US approved of a record weapons deal amounting to $60 billion, the largest such deal in US history. It included the delivery of additional F-15 fighters, Apache gunships and Black Hawk transport helicopters, many of the weapons now being used in armed aggression against neighboring Yemen. The war in Yemen prosecuted by Riyadh with US and European weaponry, has become a growing humanitarian disaster with even the US and Europe＊s own human rights advocacy groups forced to acknowledge the growing abuses being carried out by America and Europe＊s close Arab ally. And just this year, Reuters would report that the US Senate approved of an additional $1.15 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia for the delivery of over 130 M1 Abram main battle tanks as well as 20 armored recovery vehicles and addition equipment to support the newly acquired systems. Absent amid these immense weapon deals with Saudi Arabia, noted globally as a dictatorship, guilty of brutalizing its own people including through the use of public beheadings and torture, was any semblance of hesitation based on moral convictions. Indeed, the torrent of weapons the United States supplies the Saudis, in the face of a recent block on rifle sales to the Philippines, proves the United States places politics over principles. Special interests in Washington use such principles merely as a politically-convenient prop when the opportunity presents itself, and otherwise views such principles as a surmountable obstacle to be effortlessly skipped over. A United States guided by true convictions would be arming neither nation. A United States that sees convictions as politically convenient gimmicks, easily denies the Philippines rifles based on selective moral outrage while propping up a regime on the Arabian Peninsula that is brutalizing its people at home, prosecuting a devastating war in a neighboring nation and sponsoring terrorism worldwide. It is this lack of genuine, consistent moral principles that undermines the United States＊ own self-declared status as a global leader, undermining its credibility along with the faith both Americans and foreigners alike have in the waning superpower.

President Duterte＊s comments have ranged from reasonable, to utterly indifferent regarding fears of extrajudicial executions, vigilantism, and very real human rights abuses 每 opening a door of opportunity for his political opponents both at home and abroad. President Duterte＊s inability to clearly condemn extrajudicial executions and vigilante violence, along with his inflammatory, provocative, even dangerously demagogic statements both invites further abuses, as well as both legitimate and opportunistic criticism of him, his administration, and his policies. While legitimate criticism is both necessary and justified, it is undermined by disingenuous political opportunism, wielded by hypocrites who only stand to compound the Philippines＊ current crisis, not solve it. America the Humane? Among President Duterte＊s more opportunistic political opponents is the United States. While the United States would otherwise be justified and morally grounded in its criticism of President Duterte＊s administration, there are some current and past complications that reveal such criticism as stark hypocrisy, crass opportunism, and even the cynical political exploitation of abuse, rather than any genuine attempt to constructively address or stop it. The most recent manifestation of America＊s feigned concern regarding the Philippines＊ ongoing campaign against accused illicit narcotic dealers was the blocking of a shipment of US-made rifles destined for Philippine police units. Some 26,000 rifles were on order before being blocked by the US Senate based on ※concerns about human rights violations.§ These concerns, however, have not prevented the US from selling billions of dollars worth of weapons, including warplanes, munitions, tanks, and helicopters to Saudi Arabia, who is using this vast US-made arsenal to oppress its own people and execute a war of aggression against neighboring Yemen. Saudi Arabia is also admittedly involved in arming and funding terrorist organizations in Syria and Iraq, including with US-made weapons 每 particularly anti-tank TOW missiles. This hypocrisy exposes US ※concerns§ as merely politically motivated, designed to put pressure on Manila in an effort to reassert US influence over the Southeast Asian state. Not only has the US previously enjoyed greater influence over the Philippines since the end of World War II, but before the war, and for half a century, the United States literally controlled the Philippines as a US territory. It seized the Philippines in a bloody 1899-1902 war that claimed the lives of over a quarter of a million people ( some sources estimate over half a million ), and initiated an occupation marked by brutality, oppression, and torture, including the introduction of water boarding (then called ※water curing§) conducted by the US as a means of attitude adjustment for local Philippine leaders. It is ironic and telling that both water boarding and attempts by the US to maintain influence over the Philippines both persist to this day. Attempts by the US to predicate its desire to control Manila on ※concerns about human rights violations§ not only is bitterly ironic, it undermines those genuinely attempting to expose and stop real abuses taking place amid the Philippines＊ current crisis. President Duterte has been able to insulate himself from criticism precisely because of US hypocrisy and meddling. Had independent, local activists and media platforms 每 networked with regional and international organizations 每 attempted to expose and rein in President Duterte＊s anti-crime campaign, it would have been immeasurably more difficult to dismiss the facts and continue with impunity. The US has in essence discredited genuine human rights concerns by hijacking them for self-serving political objectives. Extrajudicial executions, vigilante violence, and President Duterte＊s indifference, even defense of both, needs to be opposed 每 but by the people of the Philippines 每 not disingenuous, exploitative, and self-serving foreign interests who are not only notorious human rights abusers today 每 worldwide 每 but who have carried out campaigns of extermination, torture, and human rights abuses in the Philippines itself, as a foreign conqueror and occupier. For President Duterte, it is more than possible for him to lead a more dignified and just campaign against criminals operating across the Philippines. Nations like Singapore have used stern, popular, but legitimate judicial measures to rein in the drug trade and organized crime, so can the Philippines. Doing so would close this door of opportunity President Duterte himself opened to the Americans, and leaves open with his current policies.

The world is suddenly in disarray, in panic. A man notorious for his bigoted rhetoric, a man who believes in American exceptionalism, who wants to build the walls and to ＆restore order＊, has been elected the 45 th President of the mightiest nation on Earth. His nation is doubtlessly in decline; it is indebted and some would even argue, hopelessly bankrupt, but it is still the Empire, the sole one to this day. Below the surface, Mr. Trump may not be any viler than the Democratic candidate Mrs. Clinton and her clan has been for years. The establishment with which she has been inseparably intertwined for years and decades has been murdering millions all over the world, looting entire continents, and brutally guaranteeing that the Western world would always stay firmly in control of the entire Planet. Throughout the years, Mrs. Clinton has been using ＆politically correct＊ rhetoric, mainly (and often in a twisted way) in order to silence those who dared to criticize her deeds. Still, no matter what her words were stating, millions of people have been vanishing, worldwide, as a result of the policies introduced by her and by her former boss, President Barack Obama. Donald Trump is brusque, aggressive, narcissistic and most likely, brutally honest. What he says is often pure trash, but whatever it is, he is not embarrassed to parade it in public. He has been giving many advanced warnings to both his supporters (including his voters) and to his adversaries. Objectively speaking, he is not any more or any less dangerous than Mrs. Clinton. Both candidates come from the moneyed, pro-establishment milieu. Yet Mr. Trump evokes much greater fear all over the world than his rival, from Asia and Africa to Latin America. It is at least partially because the mainstream Western propaganda rallied determinedly behind the well-tested and ＆reliable＊ Mrs. Clinton (she has proven to be subservient to the Western imperialist regime and to market fundamentalist dogmas), and the Western mainstream media is exactly what is giving ＆marching orders＊ to the local press, particularly in ＆client＊ states in all parts of the world. * Nonetheless, Mr. Trump is definitely frightening on his own account, and just because he ran against (and defeated) the establishment candidate, does not make him less so. Rowan Wolf, Managing Editor at The Greanville Post and publisher of Uncommon Thought , recently summarized what I felt about the recent elections, when she wrote to me (it was right after the results were announced): ※ I am frightened over the election of Trump. Things were going to be bad here even without that because his position as the candidate for president legitimated the ugliest bigotry and violence. His election, legitimates and institutionalizes it at the highest levels possible. It is not as if this ugliness was not present in the US as it certainly was, but it was not celebrated. His racism extends outside the US and he has already stated numerous times that he would use nukes in the Middle East and just take the oil. He also hates the Earth. He plans to reverse or remove all environmental protections and regulations, and he doesn＊t ※believe§ in global warming. His presidency could not happen at a worse time for our planet.§ * I had the extremely bad fortune of spending ＆the day after＊ in the den of the Western pro-establishment mainstream media based in Asia Pacific 每 the Foreign Correspondents＊ Club of Thailand (FCCT). Or perhaps it was not only ＆bad fortune＊ but also some type of perverse desire to witness the great and genuine desperation of those who have, for years and decades, been serving the Empire and its ＆liberal＊ dogmas, twisting the truth and manufacturing hyper-reality. Even before my arrival at the FCCT, the results of elections were finalized. I expected a great mess, and mess it was. I witnessed depressed glances, nervous laughter, small talk, and an excessive consumption of booze. Speeches soon followed: made by the members of Western human rights organizations, of several NGO＊s, and press corps. Some Iranian exile began trashing Iran, somehow loosely connecting it to the US elections. Someone else had a go at the Philippine＊s anti-imperialist President Duterte. And of course, China was hit on several occasions, and so was Russia, particularly that ＆evil＊ Putin. One after another, speakers mimicked Ms. Clinton＊s derogatory pronunciation of Russian President＊s name. No one mentioned Thailand or Indonesia even once. It was all grotesque and endlessly sad. Then the chest beating and insulting the voters slowly began＃ a slow masochistic public orgy. In the end, several well-behaved members of the public began queuing in front of the microphone, asking polite questions. Not sending the panelists to hell, not insulting them directly to their faces＃ Nothing like that! People were just asking non-confrontational questions, and then, patiently and politely waiting for replies. The ＆client＊ states of the West were still very far from the rebellion. * Then my phone became extremely active, as I began receiving messages from all corners of the globe. From Sudan: ※I never thought Donald would win! The Sudanese are making fun of Trump saying that he looks like our President Al-Basheer.§ From Italy: ※Better than Killary, but still disgusting§. From Uganda: ※Our government is acting as if it didn＊t back Hillary before the elections.§ From Argentina: ※Now in the US they will have to eat their own crap＃ as they made others eat it for decades.§ From Indonesia: ※Trump said that he would increase tariffs on imported products. In that case he＊ll have to pay more for his suits, as he apparently wears some that are made in Indonesia§. * ※Where were you on the 9-11?§ Or now: ※Where were you on 11-8?§ Some people compare these two events. On both occasions (or before), no one bothered to listen, to face reality, and as a result, some terrible events took place. On 11-8 I was in Bangkok. On 9-11 in Hanoi, Vietnam, sipping coffee, and looking out of my window. The apartment was on a higher floor of the ※Hanoi Tower§. The building was literally growing out from the old French prison, where Vietnamese patriots used to be tortured, raped and executed by the French colonialists. If I were to walk all the way towards the very glass panel, I would be able to see, far below, two shiny guillotines, preserved for people to remember the ＆great enlightened rule of the West over Asia＊. Suddenly on the horizon, the sky lit up in a tremendous explosion of colors. The villages surrounding Hanoi were shooting firecrackers and makeshift rockets up to the sky. It was a great fireworks display, something I had never seen before. I turned my television set on. On the BBC coverage, two airplanes were flying, in slow motion, towards the towers of the World Trade Center. A few minutes later I received a phone call from my best friend in Santiago de Chile. ※You would not believe what is happening here,§ he reported to me, breathless. ※People, total strangers, are stopping here, in the middle of the street. They are crying, falling into each other＊s arms, and whispering: ※Justice takes time, but it always comes!§ They were referring to 9-11-1973, when the United States overthrew one of the oldest and greatest democracies on Earth. Chile was raped, its people murdered, its form of government and its economic model were shattered. A few hours after the ※event§, both the Vietnamese and Chilean governments expressed their shock and support for the American people. In Vietnam, the celebrations were not reported. But they took place. Everyone knew it. The great anger against the Empire could be felt, and is still felt, not only in those two great nations, but also all over the world. People are outraged. Those in the United States are＃ and also those in the rest of the world are＃ although they are outraged for totally different reasons＃ but outraged they all are nevertheless! ※Democracy§ is the rule of people. It does not mean the ＆Western multi-party system＊. It only means the ＆rule of the people＊, in Greek. It can be based on the ancient ＆heavenly mandate＊ on which the Chinese system is based even now. It can be the modern Latin American form of participatory democracy＃ as long as people are ruling. However, they are not ruling. Not in the West, nor in most of the countries of the rest of the world, where the governments are forced upon them by Western imperialism to defend their states and to often adopt very tough measures to do so. People in the United States had spoken, expressing their frustration and anger. People in the rest of the world were not asked who should be leading the world. The next, the most logical step for the world should now be, immediately to reject the leadership of both the United States and Europe. Brexit and 11-8 should be followed by the WORLD-EXIT. What does it mean? Simple: ＆Let the West eat its own shit, alone, finally＊! And let the world be free from those governments and economic and colonialist concepts, which no one here (in Asia, Africa, Latin America or the Middle East) really elected and wants! Once we are at exiting, rejecting and defending, let＊s also build huge protective walls around all non-Western countries. To defend them from the Crusaders and hordes that have been looting and plundering the entire Planet for centuries. The citizens of the United States have spoken. Oh yes! So let the rest of the world do the same! Let them vote on WORLD EXIT! It is clear what the result will be!

One need to keep in mind that many US states allowed early voting, so millions of Americans had already cast their ballots beforehand; they and perhaps Kerry too did not have to be in their home districts on polling day, or perhaps he did not want to wait in long lines like in places like Ohio where the number of polling stations were reduced to keep some categories from voting. Presumably John Kerry is not one of these and his vote would have been counted. It will be remembered that Kerry stood for president himself, against George W. Bush, and would have beaten him if he had won Ohio, which he failed to do by only a few thousand votes. So you would imagine a man of such experience and seniority would be out on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton right until the polls close in the East of the country, which is when candidates traditionally claim victory or concede defeat. But Kerry wasn＊t even in the country in November 8th. He was considered so important that he had been sent to 每 of all places 每 the South Pole. While the rest of his party was hard campaigning for Clinton he was chilling it at the US military-scientific facilities there, apparently looking into something to do with ※ environmental policy § which wasn＊t part of his job description last time anyone looked. However, perhaps now, in retrospect, he knew the election results that many are now claiming was a total surprise〞how all the poll results were wrong and the American people had spoken in rejecting the status quo, and all what Clinton and those who stand behind her stand for. Nonetheless, on a lighter note, no one knows the full extent of the US footprint in Antarctica as it is all classified. The bases there are known primarily for drug abuse, which was once widespread, with the US itself supplying the drugs to its own employees as it did in Vietnam. But Kerry＊s visit there was unlikely to have influenced the outcome of the election, or indeed much else. Unless the US is willfully changing the environment of regional countries from its Antarctic bases it seems very odd that Kerry should have gone to the South Pole, and then followed up with a tour of the Southern hemisphere countries, to discuss such an issue at such an inopportune time. So why was Kerry sent to the South Pole, about as far away from the election as possible? There are plenty of possibilities, many of which are credible. But as ever, the most unlikely one is the most likely to be true 每 and it isn＊t pretty. Poles not so far apart One day the performance artist Laurie Anderson decided she would go and visit the North Pole, just like that. She managed to get near it and found it was a restricted area, owned by the US military, so she couldn＊t actually reach the pole itself . Anderson＊s North Pole trip was in 1974. Five years later a New Zealand airliner crashed into one of the Antarctic mountains, or so we were told. As a result, all civilian over flights of the South Pole were also banned. The US doesn＊t extend as far north as the North Pole, or as far south as the South Pole, but they have somehow become US-controlled territory regardless, part of the vast swathe of land where the US exacts different forms of taxation without giving the inhabitants representation. In Merab Ratishvili＊s novel White Lama the leading character ends up going to the South Pole. He finds a gap in the ice and discovers a hidden colony of very tall psychics, who live in a temperate climate and grow tropical fruit trees . That is only a story, but it is based on a real event: the attempted Nazi colonisation of Antarctica in 1938. These characters are alleged to be descendants of those Nazis, maintained by foreign powers for the own purposes . For many years it has been rumoured that the Nazis built some sort of scientific-military base in Antarctica. They are most unlikely to have gone all that way on a fishing expedition. As their victims knew, the Nazis were very well-organised and efficient. We know for example that if they had invaded England they were intending to use the town of Bridgenorth as their UK operations base 每 a very sensible choice, as it is near the geographical centre of the UK, between its two main industrial hubs of the time and gives easy access to all the important cross-country transport and communications routes. Operation Highjump After the Second World War a number of leading Nazis were spirited away to the US on ratlines so that they would neither stand trial for their crimes or have their knowledge fall into the hands of the Russians. In 1947 US Admiral Richard E. Byrd led 4,000 American , British and Australian troops in an invasion of Antarctica called ※Operation Highjump§. This and at least one follow-up expedition was called off because the troops came under attack by what are described as ※flying saucers§. Even in the country whose citizens went running to the hills when Orson Welles told them that the Martians had landed their military do not run away from flying saucers. Why is the US unable to describe what forces were unleashed against the invasion force, and by whom? What truth is so frightening it has to be shrouded in science fiction terms in order for people to dismiss the reports? Whatever the Nazis did in Antarctica, the US probably found out about it. The US biolab in Tbilisi is one of a number of dubious former Soviet facilities it has taken over and turned into restricted areas in the same way. It would be in character for the US Antarctic base to have once been operated by a foreign power, and have been taken over for ※scientific purposes§ most self-respecting scientists would never touch, those with military applications the US always denies until it can gain political capital from them. Cats among the penguins Kerry does have an indirect connection with the Nazis. Like the Bush family, he too is part of the Skull n Bones secret society. George Bush Sr＊s father, Prescott Bush, ran the Bank of America which financed the Nazi Party＊s initial bid for power, and got its own money from somewhere. Antarctic expeditions cost a lot of money, particularly when a country is spending vast amounts on armament production preparing for war. Kerry may have a personal connection with whatever is going on down there now, which the US keeps strictly under wraps. But there are also precedents for sending important people to the South Pole at historic turning points, which this US election is bound to be, whoever wins. The most famous concerned Colonel Leroy Fletcher Prouty, Chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President John F. Kennedy. He was on his way to the South Pole on a government mission at the time John F. Kennedy was shot, and for the rest of his life maintained that that was not a coincidence but a deliberate attempt to get him out of the way so that he could not impede what he later stated was a plot. Prouty retired from military service soon after the assassination, despite the siren call of the pension, and always maintained that the CIA assassinated Kennedy to prevent him taking it over after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in Cuba. He also maintained that the CIA itself answered to a shadowy global elite rather than the US government, and that this elite acts with impunity throughout the world. If so, it does so through secret societies, like Skull n Bones. As Colonel Prouty had worked in senior CIA roles for years he had considerable inside knowledge of how that organisation operated and who did what. He was dismissed as a crackpot, as all those who dispute the official version of the Kennedy assassination are, but his claim that Edward Lansdale, the basis of Burdick and Lederer＊s novel The Ugly American, was present at the scene as one of the ※Three Tramps§ is perfectly consistent with what the public knows about Lansdale and his work, let alone what Prouty must have known. We should all hope that no one is planning a political assassination. But there is some reason why Kerry was being kept out of the way. We can speculate what his connections with the shadowy global elite are, but we know his connections with the US government. If the government wanted him out of the way on Election Day, with all his campaign experience, we can assume that whatever someone doesn＊t want him to see, or he himself doesn＊t want to be implicated in, involves the current US administration itself. He who knows least lives longest Though various Americans once claimed to have been the first man to reach the North Pole the claims of each one were disputed, largely by other Americans. The first people who undoubtedly reached the North Pole were the crew of the airship Norge, which flew over it in 1926. Their commander was Roland Amundsen, who had also famously been the first person to reach the South Pole in 1912, that time by land . Amundsen did not enjoy this triumph for long, as he disappeared along with his plane and five crewmen two years later. He was searching for the missing crew of the Airship Italia, commanded by one of his 1926 crew, Umberto Nobile. Neither most of Amundsen＊s plane, or any of the bodies, have ever been found. The Airship Italia disaster aroused a lot of suspicion at the time and since. The Italian government refused to fund this polar flight. When the airship crashed one of the crew twice tried to commit suicide. The Italian ship supposedly monitoring the distress signals from the survivors ignored them and the Italian government made no attempt to rescue its stranded citizens. Eventually Captain Nobile and his pet dog were rescued while his men were left on the ice, most unusually, and many of these later disappeared without trace, just as Amundsen was later to do, having volunteered as a private citizen to lead a rescue attempt. Maybe Nobile himself didn＊t know what his polar mission was supposed to accomplish. But it was clearly something people in high places did know, and were embarrassed by. Amundsen＊s death left Nobile as the person who knew more about the two poles than anyone else, and he was subject to a smear campaign which had the effect of damaging anything he might say later, just as the one against Prouty did. Now we have a situation where the poles are considered so important that they are restricted areas controlled by the world＊s only superpower. But few people fight over other inhospitable areas. This is why various Eskimo and desert peoples are allowed to continue their traditional way of life, rather than being forcibly ※civilized§ by great powers, as, for example, the highly cultured Tibetans are by the Chinese. This changes when energy resources are involved. But even then the oil and gas-rich zones do not become restricted. They may be taken over by big corporations working hand in glove with foreign governments, but what they are doing is trumpeted to the skies, not restricted to an inner circle which probably doesn＊t include most of those carrying out the work. Frozen before the politicians get there John Kirby, the man who is trying to minimise terrorism and helping John Kerry prevent the Saudi government being prosecuted for their part in 9/11, was apparently expecting to go along with Kerry to the South Pole base when he gave his briefing. We do not know what is going on at the US South Pole base but we do know what is happening at some other US bases with a similar classified level. In each case, what we know is connected with terrorism: manufacturing biological weapons, arming and training terrorists, spying on the local population and then strangely failing to discover successful terrorist outrages in advance, despite the US admitting straight after them that it knows a great deal about the terrorists involved. At one time the Southern hemisphere wasn＊t a problem to the US. A string of compliant democratic governments and military dictatorships kept things under control well enough, despite some local terrorist groups doing their best to remove them. It could concentrate on other parts of the globe, like the Middle East, and simply send in new diplomats, or CIA torture trainers, to sort out any government that started backsliding. Now the worm has begun to turn. The Broad Left remains in control of Uruguay, despite being composed of former urban guerrillas who were tortured by previous US-backed regimes. Philippines president Roberto Duerte is cosying up to China and telling the US it has lost an ally, and despite his backtracking on this in later statements his new deals with China remain in place . Chile and Paraguay have elected leaders determined to move on from the US-controlled past, and even Nauru, the tiny phosphate-rich but future-challenged Pacific state, is selling itself to the highest bidder, a new one every week, whatever the US thinks about it . So there are reasons Kerry wanted to go to the Southern hemisphere and find new levers of influence. But he doesn＊t know whether he will be Secretary of State after the election, or who any new Secretary of State will report to. Whatever Kerry does now the new US president, Donald Trump, will just have to tolerate. Of course Kerry cannot take overtly political initiatives without knowing who the new president was going to be. But he started his diplomatic tour by having visited the South Pole 每 as mysterious, but nevertheless blatant, a command and control centre as the US has anywhere, as its own behaviour towards it makes clear. It may well be true that Kerry went to the South Pole to keep him away from something serious the US government or Soros funded NGOs are planning. But more likely his job may be to take actions which will forestall anything a new government might want to do〞such as draining the swamp. Such actions are not likely to be legal or desirable actions if they began with a visit to the US South Pole base. Whoever Kerry was really working on a highly-contested election day remains a big question; it was likely someone whose interest is in a transparent government, rule of law which are the kind of things a real democratic system is supposed to stand for.

Europe today is a powder keg, and the leaders are like men smoking in an arsenal ＃ A single spark will set off an explosion that will consume us all ＃ Otto von Bismarck, Congress of Berlin, 1878 Just when you think the loons have emptied their bag of tricks we get a week like the past one to prove you are wrong. The alleged massacre of students and teachers in the village of Hass, at the hands of the Syrian or Russian Air Forces, has had several revisions already, the truth exposed in stages. When news of the attack first broke, we saw the crazies at the UN pouring gas on a totally unproven story, delivered to us by the flagrantly CIA Syrian Observatory news front. The initial claims were backed up by the ※White Helmets§, another Western-NATO front supplying aid and comfort to the terrorists tormenting Syria under the guise of emergency workers and a multimillion NGO budget. These two ※sources§ have fed Western media a non-stop flow of alleged Damascus atrocity stories to make the casual observer think that Assad was competing with Attila the Hun for the world＊s most bloodthirsty killer award. Professional journalist and mainstream media almost never validate the claims independently as it is too dangerous for them to do so in the land of the head choppers. The Russians had little to say formally the first day, unlike all those who instantly claimed to know what happened. As they usually do they checked with all their command resources to look into what had happened. The post-strike Russian drone surveillance found no bomb holes in the roof of the school, or craters anywhere near it. The initial photo analysis mentioned images taken at different time during the day and of different locations showing damage, indicating the Islamic State media crew was using its stock footage archive once again to create a phony atrocity story. And then comes Maria Zakharovah the following day to tell us, ※An expert analysis of the photos of the Haas village in Syria revealed that there had been no air strike at the local school and that there had been no casualties. The photos are the products of computer graphics, and the killed schoolchildren are a horrible fantasy of ＆activists＊ from Al-Jazeera and The Independent.§ This news did not make the West very happy as they have walked away from the initial story like it never happened, which seems now was the case. I just checked Google and there is no updated Western media supporting the original faked version of events. Zakharovah＊s press conference report of the hoax does not even show up on Google, no surprise there. Continuing on with Syria, we have just finished another chapter in that saga, of another failed ceasefire for humanitarian purposes, getting the wounded and civilians out, and badly needed aid in, only to find the US supported insurgents blocking both. We hear only six tons of supplies were delivered to civilians. But the ※aid convoy§s must have been flowing somewhere. With the Syrian coalition planes staying ten kilometers away from Aleppo, once again the jihadis were able to get enough supplies to launch another major offensive on SW Aleppo with armored suicide vehicles, heavy artillery and armor. After making some initial gains the ※assault§ petered out and the Syrian countered attacked to recover most of the lost ground, and yet the Western press stories of Assad killing civilians in Aleppo continue to flow. The crazy award goes to the incredible media hype over the Russian flotilla heading to it station of the Syrian coast. It became a comedy like the American movie ※The Russian are Coming!§ The military and Intel factions of the NATO countries along the route spared nothing in their shameless Russian Bear mongering. Phil Butler did a wonderful piece on this story that I urge you all to read to enjoy his rapier wit. Moving over to Iraq we find the offensive to retake Mosul is being challenged by Erdogan＊s threat to send armored columns into Iraq to do a repeat ※buffer zone§ play as he did in Syria. We may see another defacto Balkanizing of a Mideast country of what has now become a Neo-pirate black flag. All you have to so is claim you are doing it to protect yourself from terrorism and invade any country you want. Iraq＊s president Abdi tells of that if Turkey follows up with its threat it will cause the breakup of Turkey, but he did not explain to us how this would happen, as I am sure Turkey would. Erdogan＊s Iraq invasion threat buried the big story of thousands of Mosul trained, head chopping, women raping, burying people alive jihadis were going to be moved to Syria to continue working for Western interests there. There was much talk of making sure they could not escape, but we do not hear a one report about one of these escaping units being shot to pieces or captured. Iran＊s famous General Qasem Soleimani has even set up a command post west of Mosul to devise an effective strategy of making sure the IS jihadis do not escape. If anybody can do it he can. Lavrov has also weighed in that the Mosul jihadis must be prevented from shifting to a new location. The war zones were not the only scenes where we say crazy things going on. We learned of Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte＊s promising to stop swearing because God threatened to take his plane down if he did not. Could the US be giving him some payback by experimenting new brain wave weapons on him for the nasty things he has said to the US? FBI Director Comey went crazy, breaking with tradition of not informing Congressional leaders about investigations, which could be leaked, especially just before an election which could be influenced. He announced an investigation into new Hillary emails on an unsecure computer, against strong Justice Department objections. We already are hearing calls for a special prosecutor to be appointed to investigate his motives in doing this. Head of Britain＊s MI-5, Andrew Parker flips out and jumps into Director Comey＊s boat on breaking with tradition by doing a public interview which an incumbent chief has never done in over 100 years. And what was his big concern he wanted to warn us about? He also was wagging the Russian Bear threat about an aggressive, expansionist Russia that was ※pushing its foreign policy abroad§ by all means. We have all been here before where the public gets the scare mongering treatment to help assure funding for way beyond the needs for real defense. A bogeyman must be dressed up and presented to justify sacrificing domestic spending to feed the military industrial complex. One would hope that Western publics would not be crazy enough to buy into this silliness. Russia is clearly interested only in protecting its most vital interests, which include helping create a multi-polar world to defend the Russian people, and others, from a US hegemony that fewer and fewer trust has benevolent intentions. The Western crazies have been indoctrinating their own people that any country or region that cannot be dominated militarily and economically as a serious threat. The official US defense policy, change under Bill Clinton, now has a clause that justifies a pre-emptive strike on a country that ※could become§ a threat in the future, even when the US and NATO defense spending and military power far surpass anyone else＊s. This of course is a blank check for wanton aggression, but to serve whose interests? Someone is either lying through their teeth to us＃or they are crazy＃or both. Jim W.

Oh good. The world reaches a crossroads, or probably a road off a cliff, just when I want to relax and watch gratuitous violence on the tube. To judge by the rapid drift of events aboard our planetary asylum, the talons of Washington and New York on the world＊s throat are fast being pried a-loose. The Global American Imperium is dying. Or so it sure looks anyway. 
I say talons of ※New York and Washington§ because America＊s foreign policy, forged in those two cities, belongs entirely to them. Americans have no influence on it. Further, none of what the Empire does abroad is of any benefit to Americans. Do you care at all what happens in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, or the South China Sea? Do you want to pay for it? America has been hijacked. 
And the Empire prospereth not. It prospereth very not. Consider the recent record of the world＊s hyperpower: 
Washington does not have control of Afghanistan, and obviously is not going to. 
Washington does not have control of Iraq, and appears unlikely to. 
Washington did not back Iran down, and isn＊t going to. 
Washington did not back Russia down in Ukraine and Crimea, and isn＊t going to. 
Washington did not back China down in the South China Sea and, while this is perhaps not over, the Empire seems to be losing. 
Washington has not backed North Korea down and is not going to. 
In the Philippines, President Duterte has told Obama to ※go to hell§ as being ※the son of a whore,§ which may be taken to indicate latent hostility. He is vigorously seeking rapprochement with China. While Washington may have him murdered, it seems to be losing control of the Little Vassals of ASEAN. 
Turkey seems to be cuddling up to Russia每that is, looking East like Duterte. Maybe Washington can turn this around temporarily, but there-s a whole lot of wavering going on. 
Meanwhile Washington thrashes around impotently as per usual in Syria, and, though the jury remains out on this one, looks to have poor prospects. If Washington每AKA New York每loses here, after doing so in Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and Afghanistan, the Empire will beyond redemption be on the downward slope. 
The United States is not in danger. The Empire is. This is not good. Empires, the Soviet Union notwithstanding, seldom go quietly. Either Washington gambles on war of some sort against Russia, or Russia and China, in the desperate hope of reversing things, or the Empire gets slowly eaten. Or not so slowly. Once one country pries itself loose, many may rush for the door. 
New York may go for calculated war against Russia每say, cyberwar expected not to turn into shooting war, shooting war in Syria not expected to turn into global shooting war, global shooting war not expected to turn into nuclear war. This will be a crapshoot. Note that America has badly misguessed the outcomes of every war since Korea. 
This is why the American election actually matters, unusual in Presidential contests. It is Blowhard against Corruption, a swell choice, but Trump is firmly against war with Russia, and Hillary for. Her military understanding is that of a fried egg. 
The woman is both a fool and a knave but, it seems, Trump has talked trash, and therefore she will likely be President. Weirdly, the future of the world depends on how an excited electorate of political middle-schoolers responds to one candidate＊s dirty talk. From a curmudgeon＊s point of view, it is pretty funny. It is funnier if one lives outside of the radiation footprint. 
But back to business. The seaboard Axis of Evil needs a war because almost every tide runs against it. Proximately, the Axis has pushed China, Russia, and Iran together against the Empire. (First rule of empire: Do not let the dissidents unite.) Many signs suggest that the world, or much of it, is beginning to see China as its future. The BRICS, the SCO, the NDB, the AAIB每all exclude the US. China becomes the major trading partner of country after country. The twilight deepens. 
Not all goes wrong for the Empire每not yet, but things are getting spooky. On the European Peninsula of Asia, countries remain docile, especially England and, much more importantly, Germany. Yet even among Washington＊s European harem, there seem to be faint stirrings of a forgotten independence. As I understand it, Germany＊s businessmen would very much like to end Washington＊s sanctions on Russia and improve trade with China, which would be greatly to the benefit of the Peninsula. Washington won＊t let them. It can＊t. If the Europeans did what would be good for themselves, and looked to Eurasia, then the fat lady, already warming up, would burst into full bellow. 
Which, methinks, raises the likelihood that Washington will in desperation do something phenomenally stupid. At this writing Hillary＊s camp seems to be prepping the public for war with Russia. The telescreen tells us day after day that Putin is Hitler, that Russia is expanding, that the Russkies are hacking the election, that they cause indigestion and falling hair. Is this just Hillary waggling her codpiece in the expectation that Moscow will demurely back down, as God intended? Or will she again send other people＊s children to fight for her in somebody else＊s country? 
The larger picture, assuredly obvious to New York, is truly grim每for New York, not for Americans. China has a huge population of a billion Han Chinese, versus two hundred million Caucasian Americans每these being the scientific, technological and entrepreneurial brains of the Empire. One must not notice this, but you can bet that New York and Beijing do. Economically China is growing hugely, advancing technologically at a high rate, building rail lines that now extend from the Chinese Pacific coast to Madrid. It will increasingly dwarf the Empire no matter what happens每short of a world war. 
The curtain falls in ways unnoticed. China recently launched a communications satellite, the world＊s first employing quantum cryptographic links, which cannot be intercepted. The intention of this, as well of the QC link from Beijing to Shanghai, is to keep the NSA off China＊s back. A small thing, perhaps. Yet if successful and adopted en masse by other countries weary of Washington＊s meddling, the result will be a loosening of the Empire＊s grip on everybody＊s communications. 
For the Empire it is, as Elvis sang, ※now or never.§ Lenin spoke of ※useful idiots.§ Ours aren＊t even useful, but they call the shots.

MINNEAPOLIS 〞 With just days to go before the election, a two-year-old speech to a prominent global bank provides new insight into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton＊s possible agenda if she takes control of the White House. 
Clinton delivered the speech on Oct. 7, 2014 to Deutsche Bank in New York , but the content of that speech and an ensuing Q&A session wasn＊t made public until WikiLeaks released it as part of the organization＊s ongoing publication of emails and files taken from the private Gmail account of John Podesta, Clinton＊s campaign chair. 
Clinton has faced pressure to release her speeches to banking executives throughout her presidential campaign, and particularly while vying for the Democratic nomination against Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who made campaign finance reform a central plank in his presidential platform. 
In her speech, Clinton acknowledged the pressures facing Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. She referenced the legacy of President Theodore Roosevelt in calling for moderate economic reforms: 
※Remember what Teddy Roosevelt did. Yes, he took on what he saw as the excesses in the economy, but he also stood against the excesses in politics. He didn＊t want to unleash a lot of nationalist, populistic reaction. He wanted to try to figure out how to get back into that balance that has served America so well over our entire nationhood.§ 
Roosevelt was known as a ※trust buster§ who was responsible for breaking up massive corporations, and he was outspoken about his wariness of big banks and wealthy business executives. 
Clinton also acknowledged ※that many Americans feel frustrated, some even angry,§ about the economic downturn, adding: ※And a lot of that anger has been directed at the financial industry.§ 
While recognizing the need for reforms, Clinton also seemed to suggest that the financial sector might be allowed to police itself: 
※Today, there＊s more that can and should be done that really has to come from the industry itself, and how we can strengthen our economy, create more jobs at a time where that＊s increasingly challenging, to get back to Teddy Roosevelt＊s square deal. And I really believe that our country and all of you are up to that job.§ 
According to one analysis of the speech and related emails, this attempt to acknowledge critics of the banking industry could have been intended as a way to placate Clinton＊s critics in the event of the eventual release of the speeches. 
※In an email on November 20, 2015 Clinton speechwriter Dan Schwerin explicitly noted how he left an ＆easter egg＊ in the DB speech precisely in case the world came knocking and asking for Hillary＊s speeches,§ wrote an anonymous contributor at Zero Hedge using the name ※Tyler Durden,§ a shared pseudonym adopted by many writers at the site, in an analysis of the speech published on Wednesday. 
In the 2015 email , Schwerin wrote: 
※I wrote her a long riff about economic fairness and how the financial industry has lost its way, precisely for the purpose of having something we could show people if ever asked what she was saying behind closed doors for two years to all those fat cats. It＊s definitely not as tough or pointed as we would write it now, but it＊s much more than most people would assume she was saying in paid speeches. ＃ Perhaps at some point there will be value in sharing this with a reporter and getting a story written.§ 
Ultimately, ※Tyler Durden§ noted, the Clinton campaign opted not to release the speeches . 
Elsewhere in the Deutsche Bank speech, Clinton acknowledged the crucial role big banks will play in Washington＊s strategic pivot to Asia. She said: 
※Will we have the discipline and dexterity to follow through on our pivot to Asia where so much of the history of the 21st century will be written, while managing new and old crises in the Middle East and Europe? 
Can we get our relationship with China right, navigating between the twin shoals of excessive accommodation and the potential for dangerous conflict? 
Will our traditional allies in Europe and East Asia step up and share the responsibilities of upholding a global order under pressure from so many fronts?§ 
The focus on Asia, started under the Obama administration and likely to continue under Clinton, if her speech is any indication, involves encircling China with economic and military allies as a way to undercut China＊s growing global influence. However, some historic allies like the Philippines have begun to push back against U.S. influence in the region. 
Many analysts see the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a controversial trade deal, as a key element to the U.S. pivot to Asia. While initially supportive of the deal, Clinton now promises to oppose the TPP as president after facing intense pressure from Sanders and activists opposed to the deal .",english,2016-11-04T18:11:36.587+02:00,mintpressnews.com,US,68691,"Leaked Deutsche Bank Speech Shows Clinton Asking Wall Street To Police Itself, Supporting US Pivot To Asia",0,http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AP_332360628323-001-800x500.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during a news conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, December 5, 2012. 
NEW YORK 〞 As the bizarre 2016 presidential election nears its end, activists in the United States are considering the prospects for war and peace under the next administration. 
And with Hillary Clinton leading comfortably in most polls, the Democratic nominee＊s militaristic record, as well as her promises to expand the use of force, are sparking concern. 
※Clinton is one of the biggest war-mongers the country has,§ Joe Lombardo, co-coordinator of the United National Antiwar Coalition , told MintPress News. 
※She pushed for the bombing of Libya and the regime change in that country. She has supported a no-fly zone in Syria, which can put the U.S. in direct conflict with Russia.§ 
On the campaign trail, Clinton has repeatedly advocated a ※no-fly zone§ in Syria, an aggressive move necessarily accompanied by a widespread bombing campaign, similar to those in Iraq and Libya, which were followed by expanded interventions to impose regime change. 
Senior U.S. military pilots have warned that the proposal could plunge the United States into direct conflict with Russia, whose air force is currently deployed over Syria. 
In September, Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate that the prospect ※requires us to go to war against Syria and Russia.§ 
＆Kill a lot of Syrians＊ 
※It is critical that we not be confused about what Clinton＊s promise of a no-fly zone will mean,§ Meredith Aby of the Minneapolis-based Anti-War Committee told MintPress. 
※It is an escalation of U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war and it will mean an increase in casualties.§ 
In 2013, Clinton herself admitted in a paid speech to Goldman Sachs, obtained and released by WikiLeaks in September, that her proposal would ※kill a lot of Syrians.§ 
※To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas,§ she said. 
Beyond Syria, Clinton has also threatened to attack and ※totally obliterate§ Iran , and she has repeatedly promised to take the United States＊ ties with Israel ※to the next level.§ 
In August, after accusing Russia and China of hacking U.S. computer systems, she warned : ※We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.§ 
＆A voice for war since 2002＊ US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, left, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talk in Jerusalem, Israel, Monday, July 16, 2012. 
These statements, along with Clinton＊s long, unbroken record of supporting military interventions, have anti-war activists eying the future warily. 
※Many in the anti-war movement understand the dangers of a Clinton presidency,§ Aby said. 
※From her resume it is fairly obvious she will be a hawk, more so than President Obama and President Clinton. She has been a voice for war since 2002 when she voted for war in Iraq.§ 
Beyond Clinton＊s explicit threats of wars, her administration may also seek to expand the use of ※soft power,§ ranging from diplomatic assistance and military aid to subversion and coups, in pursuit of its foreign policy goals. 
※She has called for boosting U.S. support for Israeli missile defense systems and supports helping Israel with technology to fight in Gaza,§ Aby said, adding: ※On the campaign trail, she has denounced the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement as a threat to Israel. And while she hasn＊t campaigned on it, she is no friend of Latin America. Her own emails show the role she played in helping provide support for the coup in Honduras.§ 
Lombardo also noted that regions further removed from the headlines than flashpoints like Syria could face similar threats from a Hillary Clinton administration. 
※The Philippines is heating up and Clinton has a history in Latin America, where there are many places that the U.S. would like to see regime change,§ he said. 
＆A very unpopular president from day one＊ 
In the waning months of the campaign, both Clinton and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, have emerged as historically unpopular candidates , more so than others in the era of scientific polling. 
Indeed, while Trump＊s aggression has kept his popularity below Clinton＊s, she recently surpassed the bellicose billionaire as the least-liked candidate in history. 
A poll released by ABC News and the Washington Post on Tuesday showed Clinton＊s unpopularity had reached a record-breaking 60 percent, while Trump＊s stood at 58 percent. 
Despite her jingoism and promises to expand U.S. military efforts far beyond those of Barack Obama, organizers hope this public disdain may give them room to maneuver. 
※Although Clinton will win the presidency, she will be a very unpopular president from day one, which will give us the political space to organize opposition to her foreign policy,§ Aby said. 
Lombardo agreed. ※Clinton is very unpopular, and while the election of Obama put a damper on the anti-war movement, I believe we will see that turn around under Clinton.§ 
He also noted the growth of domestic social movements, like Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter, that could herald a resurgence in mobilization. 
※There is a downturn in the economy, distrust of the government and the system as a whole,§ Lombardo said. ※The connections with the wars abroad and the wars at home is clear to more and more people. I think a movement against increased war can be explosive and powerful during a Clinton administration.§ 
But he added that there was much work to be done. ※Although anti-war sentiment in the U.S. is high, the anti-war movement in weak compared to where it was in the past.§ 
＆No optimism, only apprehension＊ A woman with the words ※hands off§ painted on her face takes part in a protest organized by the Stop the War coalition calling for no military attack on Syria from the U.S., Britain or France, across the road from the entrance of Downing Street in London, Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2013. 
As the clock ticks down to the election, numerous organizations have launched new efforts they hope will preempt the war drive expected to start soon after Jan. 20. 
Along with other groups and individual supporters, the United National Antiwar Coalition launched a ※Hands Off Syria Coalition§ and accompanying statement against further U.S. intervention in the war-torn country. 
The effort ※is getting a tremendous response,§ Lombardo said. 
Other organizations, including the ANSWER Coalition and International Action Center , have called for protests against the inauguration in Washington. 
※There＊s no optimism, only apprehension,§ International Action Center co-director Sara Flounders told MintPress. ※People know in their bones that a larger war is coming. From the first day of a new administration, we need to send an angry warning.§ 
But with the United States fatigued from a grueling election season that has left few residents with positive impressions of either candidate, widespread distrust of the political system may deny the new president the mandate he or she would need to embark on new military adventures. 
※I think people are less naive now then they were eight years ago,§ Aby said. ※People understand that foreign policy is not an issue that truly separates the two major party candidates.§ Be Sociable, Share!",english,2016-11-07T16:40:48.816+02:00,mintpressnews.com,US,68691,Anti-War Movement Anticipates More War Under A Clinton Presidency,0,http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AP_376997528384-800x541.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

※Many in the anti-war movement understand the dangers of a Clinton presidency,§ Aby said.
※From her resume it is fairly obvious she will be a hawk, more so than President Obama and President Clinton. She has been a voice for war since 2002 when she voted for war in Iraq.§
Beyond Clinton＊s explicit threats of wars, her administration may also seek to expand the use of ※soft power,§ ranging from diplomatic assistance and military aid to subversion and coups, in pursuit of its foreign policy goals.
※She has called for boosting U.S. support for Israeli missile defense systems and supports helping Israel with technology to fight in Gaza,§ Aby said, adding:
※On the campaign trail, she has denounced the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement as a threat to Israel. And while she hasn＊t campaigned on it, she is no friend of Latin America. Her own emails show the role she played in helping provide support for the coup in Honduras.§
Lombardo also noted that regions further removed from the headlines than flashpoints like Syria could face similar threats from a Hillary Clinton administration.
※The Philippines is heating up and Clinton has a history in Latin America, where there are many places that the U.S. would like to see regime change,§ he said.
＆A very unpopular president from day one＊ In the waning months of the campaign, both Clinton and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, have emerged as historically unpopular candidates , more so than others in the era of scientific polling.
Indeed, while Trump＊s aggression has kept his popularity below Clinton＊s, she recently surpassed the bellicose billionaire as the least-liked candidate in history.
A poll released by ABC News and the Washington Post on Tuesday showed Clinton＊s unpopularity had reached a record-breaking 60 percent, while Trump＊s stood at 58 percent.
Despite her jingoism and promises to expand U.S. military efforts far beyond those of Barack Obama, organizers hope this public disdain may give them room to maneuver.
※Although Clinton will win the presidency, she will be a very unpopular president from day one, which will give us the political space to organize opposition to her foreign policy,§ Aby said.
Lombardo agreed. ※Clinton is very unpopular, and while the election of Obama put a damper on the anti-war movement, I believe we will see that turn around under Clinton.§
He also noted the growth of domestic social movements, like Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter, that could herald a resurgence in mobilization.
※There is a downturn in the economy, distrust of the government and the system as a whole,§ Lombardo said. ※The connections with the wars abroad and the wars at home is clear to more and more people. I think a movement against increased war can be explosive and powerful during a Clinton administration.§
But he added that there was much work to be done. ※Although anti-war sentiment in the U.S. is high, the anti-war movement in weak compared to where it was in the past.§
＆No optimism, only apprehension＊ A woman with the words ※hands off§ painted on her face takes part in a protest organized by the Stop the War coalition calling for no military attack on Syria from the U.S., Britain or France, across the road from the entrance of Downing Street in London, Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2013.
As the clock ticks down to the election, numerous organizations have launched new efforts they hope will preempt the war drive expected to start soon after Jan. 20.
Along with other groups and individual supporters, the United National Antiwar Coalition launched a ※Hands Off Syria Coalition§ and accompanying statement against further U.S. intervention in the war-torn country.
The effort ※is getting a tremendous response,§ Lombardo said.
Other organizations, including the ANSWER Coalition and International Action Center , have called for protests against the inauguration in Washington.
※There＊s no optimism, only apprehension,§ International Action Center co-director Sara Flounders told MintPress. ※People know in their bones that a larger war is coming. From the first day of a new administration, we need to send an angry warning.§
But with the United States fatigued from a grueling election season that has left few residents with positive impressions of either candidate, widespread distrust of the political system may deny the new president the mandate he or she would need to embark on new military adventures.
※I think people are less naive now then they were eight years ago,§ Aby said. ※People understand that foreign policy is not an issue that truly separates the two major party candidates.§",english,2016-11-07T18:31:43.152+02:00,mintpressnews.com,US,68691,Anti-War Movement Anticipates More War Under A Clinton Presidency,0,https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AP_376997528384-800x541.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Amid the seemingly friendlier atmosphere in the South China Sea, China was reportedly in a ＆ready for combat＊ position as it prepares to position its first aircraft carrier in the region. 
While some claimant countries in the highly disputed maritime zone, such as the Philippines, have shifted their foreign policies and began dealing with China bilaterally, tension in the region is far from over. Asserts Position In The Region 
As reported by the state-run news website the Global Times , China is battle ready and is prepared for any possibilities or conflict that may arise in the region. The aircraft carrier, Liaoning, is the first of its kind in the Chinese Navy. 
Also Read: South China Sea Row 每 What Will Happen Now As Donald Trump Enters The Picture? 
The 60,000-ton Liaoning sports a launch pad that is much wider than a typical football field. This aircraft launcher also features high-tech military capabilities that China can use in performing its patrols and surveillance in the region. 
But Li Dongyou, a Chinese political commissar who was aboard the Liaoning, said the showing off of the aircraft carrier was not intended to ignite tension in the region. Always War Ready 
※As a military force, we are always prepared for war and our combat capacity also needs to be tested by war. At this moment, we are doing our best to promote our strength and use it to prevent war, and are prepared for actual combat at any time,§ Dongyou was also quoted saying by the Global Times .

Members of local and foreign media were allowed to board the massive aircraft carrier, but the tight security measure has been implemented. Chinese officials also admitted that they specifically told those who were invited on what they can see and not see. 
While the world awaits Donald Trump＊s position in the region, his close aide hinted that the president-elect won＊t abandon its Asian allies, the Associated Press reported.

To say that this is the election from hell is to insult hell. 
There＊s been nothing like this since Washington forded the Rubicon or Trump crossed the Delaware or delivered the Gettysburg Address (you know, the one that began ※Four score and eleven women ago＃§) 〞 or pick your own seminal moment in American history. 
Billions of words, that face, those gestures, the endless insults , the abused women and the emails, the 24/7 spectacle of it all＃ Whatever happens on Election Day, let＊s accept one reality: we＊re in a new political era in this country. We just haven＊t quite taken it in. Not really. 
Forget Donald Trump. 
Doh! Why did I write that? Who could possibly forget the first presidential candidate in our history preemptively unwilling to accept election results? (Even the South in 1860 accepted the election of Abraham Lincoln before trying to wave goodbye to the Union.) Who could forget the man who claimed that abortions could take place on the day of or the day before actual birth? Who could forget the man who claimed in front of an audience of nearly 72 million Americans that he had never met the women who accused him of sexual aggression and abuse, including the People magazine reporter who interviewed him? Who could forget the candidate who proudly cited his positive polling results at rallies and in tweets, month after month, before (when those same polls turned against him) discovering that they were all ※ rigged §? 
Whatever you think of The Donald, who in the world 〞 and I mean the whole wide world (including the Iranians ) 〞 could possibly forget him or the election he＊s stalked so ominously? When you think of him, however, don＊t make him the cause of American political dysfunction. He＊s just the bizarre, disturbed, and disturbing symptom of the transformation of the American political system. 
Admittedly, he is a one-of-a-kind ※politician,§ even among his associates in surging right-wing nationalist and anti-whatever movements globally. He makes France＊s Marine Le Pen seem like the soul of rationality and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte look like a master tactician of our age. But what truly makes Donald Trump and this election season fascinating and confounding is that we＊re not just talking about the presidency of a country, but of the country. The United States remains the great imperial state on Planet Earth in terms of the reach of its military and the power of its economy and culture to influence the workings of everything just about everywhere. And yet, based on the last strange year of election campaigning, it＊s hard not to think that something 〞 and not just The Donald 〞 is unnervingly amiss on Planet America. 
The World War II Generation in 2016 
Sometimes, in my fantasies (as while watching the final presidential debate), I perform a private miracle and bring my parents back from the dead to observe our American world. With them in the room, I try to imagine the disbelief many from that World War II generation would surely express about our present moment. Of course, they lived through a devastating depression, light years beyond anything we experienced in the Great Recession of 2007-2008, as well as a global conflagration of a sort that had never been experienced and 〞 short of nuclear war 〞 is not likely to be again. 
Despite this, I have no doubt that they would be boggled by our world and the particular version of chaos we now live with. To start at a global level, both my mother (who died in 1977) and my father (who died in 1983) spent decades in the nuclear age, the era of humanity＊s greatest 〞 for want of a better word 〞 achievement. After all, for the first time in history, we humans took the apocalypse out of the hands of God (or the gods), where it had resided for thousands of years, and placed it directly in our own. What they didn＊t live to experience, however, was history＊s second potential deal-breaker, climate change, already bringing upheaval to the planet, and threatening a slow-motion apocalypse of an unprecedented sort. 
While nuclear weapons have not been used since August 9, 1945 , even if they have spread to the arsenals of numerous countries, climate change should be seen as a snail-paced version of nuclear war 〞 and keep in mind that humanity is still pumping near-record levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. I imagine my parents＊ amazement that the most dangerous and confounding issue on the planet didn＊t get a single question , not to speak of an answer, in the three presidential debates of 2016, the four and a half hours of charges, insults, and interruptions just past. Neither a moderator, nor evidently an undecided voter (in the town hall second debate), nor either presidential candidate 〞 each ready to change the subject on a moment＊s notice from embarrassing questions about sexual aggression, emails, or anything else 〞 thought it worth the slightest attention. It was, in short, a problem too large to discuss, one whose existence Donald Trump (like just about every other Republican) denies, or rather, in his case, labels a ※hoax§ that he uniquely blames on a Chinese plot to sink America. 
So much for insanity (and inanity) when it comes to the largest question of all. On a somewhat more modest scale, my mom and dad wouldn＊t have recognized our political world as American, and not just because of Donald Trump. They would have been staggered by the money pouring into our political system 〞 at least $6.6 billion in this election cycle according to the latest estimate, more than 10% of that from only 100 families. They would have been stunned by our 1% elections ; by our new Gilded Age ; by a billionaire TV celebrity running as a ※populist§ by riling up once Democratic working-class whites immiserated by the likes of him and his ※brand§ of casino capitalism, scam, and spectacle; by all those other billionaires pouring money into the Republican Party to create a gerrymandered Congress that will do their obstructionist bidding; and by just how much money can be ※invested§ in our political system in perfectly legal ways these days. And I haven＊t even mentioned the Other Candidate, who spent all of August on the true ※campaign trail,§ hobnobbing not with ordinary Americans but with millionaires and billionaires (and assorted celebrities ) to build up her phenomenal ※ war chest .§ 
I would have to take a deep breath and explain to my parents that, in twenty-first-century America, by Supreme Court decree, money has become the equivalent of speech, even if it＊s anything but ※free.§ And let＊s not forget that other financial lodestone for an American election these days: the television news, not to speak of the rest of the media. How could I begin to lay out for my parents, for whom presidential elections were limited fall events, the bizarre nature of an election season that starts with media speculation about the next-in-line just as the previous season is ending, and continues more or less nonstop thereafter? Or the spectacle of talking heads discussing just about nothing but that election 24/7 on cable television for something like a full year, or the billions of ad dollars that have fueled this never-ending Super Bowl of campaigns, filling the coffers of the owners of cable and network news? 
We＊ve grown strangely used to it all, but my mom and dad would undoubtedly think they were in another country 〞 and that would be before they were even introduced to the American system as it now exists, the one for which Donald Trump is such a bizarre front man. 
What Planet Is This Anyway? 
I wish I still had my high school civics text. If you＊re of a certain age, you＊ll remember it: the one in which a man from Mars lands on Main Street, USA, to be lectured on the glories of American democracy and our carefully constructed, checked-and-balanced tripartite form of governance. I＊m sure knowledge of that system changed life on Mars for the better, even if it was already something of a fantasy here on Earth in my parents＊ time. After all, Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower 〞 my mom and dad voted for Democrat Adlai Stevenson 〞 was the one who, in his farewell address in 1961, first brought ※the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power§ and ※the military-industrial complex§ to the attention of the American people. 
Yes, all of that was already changing then, as a peacetime war state of unparalleled size developed in this country. Still, 30-odd years after my father＊s death, surveying the American landscape, my parents might believe themselves on Mars. They would undoubtedly wonder what exactly had happened to the country they knew. After all, thanks to the Republican Party＊s scorched-earth tactics in these last years in bipolar Washington, Congress, that collection of putative representatives of the people (now a crew of well-paid, well-financed representatives of the country＊s special interests in a capital overrun with corporate lobbyists), hardly functions anymore. Little of significance makes it through the porticos of the Capitol. Recently, for instance, John McCain (usually considered a relatively ※moderate§ Republican senator) suggested 〞 before walking his comments part way back 〞 that if Hillary Clinton were elected president, his fellow Republican senators might decide a priori not to confirm a single Supreme Court justice she nominated during her tenure in office. That, of course, would mean a court now down to what looks like a permanent crew of eight would shrink accordingly. And his comments, which once would have shocked Americans to the core, caused hardly a ripple of upset or protest. 
On my tour of this new world, I might start by pointing out to my mom and dad that the U.S. is now in a state of permanent war , its military at the moment involved in conflicts in at least six countries in the Greater Middle East and Africa. These are all purely presidential conflicts, as Congress no longer has a real role in American war-making (other than ponying up the money for it and beating the drums to support it). The executive branch stands alone when it comes to the war powers once checked and balanced in the Constitution. 
And I wouldn＊t want my parents to simply look abroad. The militarization of this country has proceeded apace and in ways that, I have not the slightest doubt, would shock them to their core. I could take my parents, for instance, to Grand Central Station in midtown Manhattan, their hometown and still mine, and on any day of the week they would see the once-inconceivable: actual armed soldiers on guard in full camo. I could mention that, at my local subway stop, I＊ve several times noted a New York police department counterterror squad that could be mistaken for a military Special Ops team, assault rifles slung across their chests, and no one even stops and gawks anymore. I could point out that the police across the country increasingly have the look of military units and are supplied by the Pentagon with actual weaponry and equipment directly off distant U.S. battlefields, including armored vehicles of various sorts. I could mention that military surveillance drones, those precursors of future robotic warfare (and, for my parents, right out of the childhood sci-fi novels I used to read), are now regularly in American skies ; that advanced surveillance equipment developed in far-off war zones is now being used by the police here at home; and that, though political assassination was officially banned in the post-Watergate 1970s, the president now commands a formidable CIA drone force that regularly carries out such assassinations across large swaths of the planet, even against U.S. citizens , and without the say-so of anyone outside the White House, including the courts. I could mention that the president who, in my parents＊ time, commanded one modest-sized secret army, the CIA＊s paramilitaries, now essentially presides over a full-scale secret military, the Special Operations Command: 70,000 elite troops cocooned inside the larger U.S. military, including elite teams ready to be deployed on what are essentially executive missions across the planet. 
I could point out that, in the twenty-first century, U.S. intelligence has set up a global surveillance state that would have shamed the totalitarian powers of the previous century and that American citizens, en masse, are included in it; that our emails (a new concept for my parents) have been collected by the millions and our phone records made available to the state; that privacy, in short, has essentially been declared un-American. I would also point out that, on the basis of one tragic day and what otherwise has been the most modest of threats to Americans, a single fear 〞 of Islamic terrorism 〞 has been the pretext for the building of the already existing national security state into an edifice of almost unbelievable proportions that has been given once unimaginable powers, funded in ways that should amaze anyone (not just visitors from the American past), and has become the unofficial fourth branch of the U.S. government without either discussion or a vote. 
Little that it does 〞 and it does a lot 〞 is open to public scrutiny. For their own ※safety,§※the People§ are to know nothing of its workings (except what it wants them to know). Meanwhile, secrecy of a claustrophobic sort has spread across significant parts of the government. The government classified 92 million documents in 2011 and things seem not to have gotten much better since. In addition, the national security state has been elaborating a body of ※ secret law §〞 including classified rules, regulations, and interpretations of already existing law 〞 kept from the public and, in some cases, even from congressional oversight committees. 
Americans, in other words, know ever less about what their government does in their name at home and abroad. 
I might suggest to my parents that they simply imagine the Constitution of the United States being rewritten and amended in secrecy and on the fly in these years without as much as a nod to ※We, the People.§ In this way, as our elections became elaborate spectacles, democracy was sucked dry and ditched in all but name 〞 and that name is undoubtedly Donald J. Trump. 
Consider that, then, a brief version of how I might describe our new American world to my amazed parents. 
America as a National Security State 
None of this is The Donald＊s responsibility. In the years in which a new American system was developing, he was firing people on TV. You could, of course, think of him as the poster boy for an America in which spectacle, celebrity, the gilded class of One Percenters, and the national security state have melded into a narcissistic, self-referential brew of remarkable toxicity. 
Whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is elected president, one thing is obvious: the vast edifice that is the national security state, with its 17 intelligence agencies and enormous imperial military, will continue to elaborate itself and expand its power in our American world. Both candidates have sworn to pour yet more money into that military and the intelligence and Homeland Security apparatus that goes with it. None of this, of course, has much of anything to do with American democracy as it was once imagined. 
Someday perhaps, like my parents, ※I§ will be called back from the dead by one of my children to view with awe or horror whatever world exists. Long after the America of an unimaginable Donald J. Trump presidency or a far-more-imaginable Hillary Clinton version of the same has been folded into some god-awful, half-forgotten chapter in our history, I wonder what will surprise or confound ※me§ then. What version of our country and planet will ※I§ face in 2045? 0 0 0 0 0 0",english,2016-11-04T09:29:57.208+02:00,nakedcapitalism.com,US,54210,"Comment on Creating a National Security State ＆Democracy,＊ Or How the American Political System Changed and No One Noticed by James Miller",0,http://www.tomdispatch.com/images/managed/shadowgovengelhardt.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

The Democrat establishment was warned about their weak candidate, and they were presented with a popular and well-funded alternative: Bernie Sanders. Instead, as the Podesta emails show in lavish detail, they used their control of the party machinery and their service providers in our famously free press to rig the election in their favor at every turn. When their candidate was nominated, the Democrat establishment tacked right, and proceeded to explain to Sanders voters that their voters were not needed because, as #BernieBros, they were racist and sexist. Sanders supporters have every right to say #WeWereRight and #WeToldYouSo. 
If this were Japan, we＊d be seeing Democrat Party leaders committing seppuku, or cutting off their little fingers or 〞 supposing them not to be gangsters 〞 ritually and tearfully bowing to the people they betrayed.

Honey for the Bears: ※The growth in U.S. imports of goods has been stubbornly low since the second quarter of 2015, with an average annual growth rate of 0.7 percent. Growth has been even weaker for non-oil imports, which have increased at an average annual rate of only 0.1 percent. This is in sharp contrast to the pattern in the five quarters preceding the second quarter of 2015, when real non-oil imports were growing at an annualized rate of 8 percent per quarter§ [ Liberty Stree t]. ※How has the recent slowdown in U.S. investment affected U.S. imports? The next chart shows that U.S. capital goods imports are very highly correlated with equipment investment〞a category that excludes intangibles, residential investment, and changes in inventories. Equipment investment has been unusually weak, with its four-quarter percentage change falling into negative territory, which is unusual outside a recession period. These data suggest that the slowdown in import growth likely stems from whatever is behind the weakness in equipment, rather than from trade-specific factors such as trade policies or higher trade costs.§ Well, we do have a capitalist economy＃

※An American Tragedy§ [David Remnik, The New Yorker (2:40AM). ※That the electorate has, in its plurality, decided to live in Trump＊s world of vanity, hate, arrogance, untruth, and recklessness, his disdain for democratic norms, is a fact that will lead, inevitably, to all manner of national decline and suffering.§ Notice the flaccidity of the language: ※democratic norms§; ※all manner of§; ※a fact＃ that will lead to.§ Remnik really needs an editor.

※Americans are not and have never been united by blood or creed, but by allegiance to a democratic system of government that shares power, cherishes the rule of law and respects the dignity of individuals. We hope our newly elected president will show respect for that system. Americans must stand ready to support him if he does, and to support the system whether he does or does not§ [Editorial Board, WaPo ]. Would that any of those things were true. Perhaps for the individuals on WaPo＊s editorial board, they are.

I＊ve always wondered why the Democrats never really work to extent the franchise. Here at least we have the ideological justification. 
※Today the world has seen the end of two centuries of Anglo-Saxon dominance 每 a hundred years of Britain, from the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 to the Battle of the Somme, and a hundred years of the United States, ending today, with the election as president of the US of a fascist ＆television personality＊ married to a nude model§ [ Splash 247 ]. ※＆Decadence＊ is the term that we need, here 每 decadence on a scale not seen in the world since the fall of the Roman Empire 每 which fell in much the same way, for much the same reasons.§ 
We have now seen a hat trick of ＆democratic＊ events in which men who come from the elite, and who have betrayed their class 每 Roderigo Duterte, in the Philippines, on May 9, was the straw in the wind, he was followed by Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage in the UK, on June 23, and today by Donald Trump in the US, and they have, with the use of the internet social media, most especially Mark Zuckerberg＊s Facebook, successfully suckered the soggy mass of lazy, ill-educated, ill-read and ill-informed proles, and a good supply of what V.I. Lenin called ※useful idiots§, in three nations, into putting them into power, by telling lies and by promising the proles what they want. 
What the proles want is ＆good jobs＊ but with the ability to buy the stuff they buy now at cheap prices, because it is made by under paid, hardworking, men and women in other countries who have ＆stolen their jobs＊, and they want ＆no foreigners＊. They can＊t have this, of course, but no matter, they don＊t read, they just look at ＆memes＊, and the damage is done. 
Leave it to the Brits to work in the class angle, quote Lenin, and toss in an Orwell reference! 
※Trump voters will not like what happens next§ [Garrison Keillor, WaPo ]. ※America is still the land where the waitress＊ kids can grow up to become physicists and novelists and pediatricians, but it helps a lot if the waitress and her husband encourage good habits and the ambition to use your God-given talents and the kids aren＊t plugged into electronics day and night.§ Help me. 
※Americans have done a very dangerous thing this week. Because of what they have done we all face dark, uncertain and fearful times§ [ Guardian ]. 
※＆Dear God, America what have you done?＊: How the world and its media reacted as Donald Trump became US President-elect§ [ Telegraph ]. A nice round-up of front page images. 
Policy 
※Trump won largely because people couldn＊t bring themselves to vote for Clinton, and not so much because anyone like him or his presumed agenda. And along the way he destroyed the Republican party, which may or may not sit so well with Republicans in Congress§ [ Mosler Economics] . ※So it＊s not like he has a mandate to do anything or that he can rely on Republican support for anything.§ I＊m not so sure; I see the Republican primary and the general taken together a repudiation of both party establishments and the political class in its totality. That said, this is important: 
Regarding his proposed tax cuts, under current law bills can＊t be introduced in Congress unless they are ＆paid for＊, so, for example, to introduce a tax cut it has to be paid for by spending cuts. Yes, Congress could change the law or override it but that would require Senate approval, and that takes a 60% majority that Republicans don＊t have. 
So my point is that at best it＊s going to take a very long time to get anything done. And the way all the charts are decelerating it could all get pretty ugly waiting for the kind of fiscal adjustment needed to reverse course. 
※The new Senate＊s Republican majority will remain short of the 60 votes needed for a full repeal. But Congress demonstrated in the past year that it could use the upper chamber＊s reconciliation process 〞 requiring just 50 votes 〞 to send a bill undoing major ACA elements to the White House. Last winter, President Obama vetoed that legislation§ [ WaPo ]. Meaning, of course, that the Democrats could have done exactly the same thing in 2009, but passed HR676 or SB703. That, throwing a bankster or two in jail, and a decent stimulus package instead of the one Larry Summers deked Obama into approving, and the Democrats might control all three branches of government today. And so it goes. 
The Voters 
※As of 11:55 a.m. ET, Clinton had amassed 59,458,295 votes nationally, to Trump＊s 59,265,380 〞 a margin of 192,915 that puts Clinton on track to become the fifth U.S. presidential candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election§ [ NPR ]. But the first woman!

The play develops with the .1% quarterback doing a reverse pivot (causing the progressive linebackers to hold their position instead of rushing to sack the QB), faking a quick toss to the left outside, where only the down ballot players are located, turns and runs toward the right, threatening to keep the ball, pitch it to Icame/HenowDed or throw downfield to MSM. 
MSM does one hell of a fake job getting the gullible and other gatekeepers to concentrate on stopping the OrangeOne, while the down ticket no names streak down the left side of the field in a space created by sleight of hand of the .1%. Many in the crowd could see what was developing, but they were mesmerized and sickening quiet as the .1% dollars reverse flowed to those down ticket of Orange the Dickless. Barrel of Dollars from the Quantitative Facilities. License DMCA - Advertisement - 
I have no right to complain even though I suspected a trick play as the .1% came up to the line. Why would the.1% risk having a blabber mouth plant the idea that NATO had outlived its usefulness? Or that the trade deals were a bunch of crap for the 99.99%, certainly the 50%? No, it would not have been prudent. The .1% is not yet prepared to go for total population control this early in their Plan that a Trumpet presidency would cause: riots in the American cities and countryside and the resulting roll out of permanent martial law and surveillance. Their plate was full and their cup runneth over with the likes of a failed coup in Turkey for whom they and their western cohorts must pay the chump change of a couple of billion dollars in extortion demanded by Erdogan or face his unleashing of leased terrorists in European cities. Yes their bloody hands were full from bombed and drone attacked civilians in funeral processions, and UN humanitarian convoys, patients, doctors and nurses in hospitals one of which where those anti-globalist doctors without borders were aiding the sovereign government, droning on and on to Libya, Yemen with a drone strike here and there, keeping a peering eye on Mo-uglies friends in Mogadishu, trying to pave a road to Tehran, while prepping the former Russian protectorates for turmoil and division, aka The Stans, and talking smack to the Russians about the Crimea, as they move to conduct war execercises in Poland and place missile systems in not only Poland but Romania all the while letting the Chinese know that they are pivoting toward them with Australia and the Philippines in tow -- That's a lot all right. I could have edumacated myself about who was running down ticket and yelled and screamed and organize but I was too focused on the fact that the .1% was so obvious that everyone would know to vote downtown to throw out the .1% cronies. 
Unfortunately the .1% has a deep bench, and the defense was unprepared. Sucked in by the expectation that the court of referees would throw yellow flags against the .1% for voter interference, personal fouls, holding and widespread unsportsmanlike conduct of the Clinton primaries, I now watch in disbelief as the refs picked up their god damn flags and put them back into their pockets with only seconds left, while the .1% cronies stroll down field pushing barrels of quantitatively eased dollars to win over the brain dead including those with no brains. 
I don't think I can stuff any more allegory into this sports analogy, I could talk about the after game show, arm chair quarterbacking by the losing team, but by now I think you have got the freakin picture. 
Perhaps someone would like to take a crack along similar lines of the big bad wolf huffing and puffing? We can leave any time we want, so don't cry for us. License DMCA

License DMCA 
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in Beijing, China announcing separation from the United States Considering US belligerence in the world particularly since 9/11, the idea of a countries elected leader standing up and defying the US hyper power is something to behold. The latest leader to exercise his countries right of sovereignty is Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte speaking during a state visit to Beijing, China announced, ""Your honors, in this venue, I announce my separation from the United States...both in military and economics also"".[1] He said, ""America has lost"" while announcing a new alliance the Philippines, China and Russia, ""there are three of us against the world"". Of course Duterte is not the first leader to poke his middle finger at the US imperialist. Fidel Castro did it with Cuba in 1959, as did Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1999. Two at least who spoke truth to power, put his people first at great risk to himself when they separated their country from US hegemony over them, survived many US attempts to undermine or assassinate and overthrow them. There's too many others to mention here that didn't survive or were overthrown in CIA initiated coups, color revolutions, regime change et al. Is this somehow subversive coming from an American extolling foreign leaders that have defied the US? Or is it an acknowledgement that we, the US, can't dictate to the world. That it's a countries elected leaders purpose to exercise his judgment to do right by his people, follow an independent course to best serve his people, not be subservient and dictated to by the US. If the people disagree with such a leader they can elect someone else or impeach him for felonious behavior. Maybe that's a bit naive, too ideal for the complex world we live in today. - Advertisement - But we as a country have completely lost our way, been an imperialist bully, initiating illegal wars and occupations, aggression against countries that are no threat, imminent or otherwise to America. Authorized torture, indefinite detention, extraordinary rendition, kill innocents in drone strikes and missile attacks, order the targeted assassination of anyone, anywhere, including American citizens if the president alone so decides. Initiate coups and regime change against any country that defies the US while conducting surveillance of ALL electronic communications of everyone in the world. This is not the behavior of a country capable of having mutual respect for others particularly those countries taking an independent course and not bowing to US diktat. We Americans can close our eyes, pretend or ignore what we have become; a rogue actor on the world stage. Yes rogue. What gave us the right to be the ""indispensible country"", exceptional, entitled, run roughshod against any leader-Putin being the leader now most demonized in US crosshairs. As for the Philippines, we took it as well as Cuba and Puerto Rico; booty from Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish American war of 1898. - Advertisement - Of course earlier in our countries inglorious history we stole much of what is now California, Texas and the southwest from Mexico while committing genocide and stealing most of the arable and tribal lands of the indigenous native peoples all in the name of ""manifest destiny"", as if it was some benign, natural, yet inexorable happenstance. Yeah right. Let's admit it. Today we're the beneficiaries of our countries earlier ""successful"" aggression against the indigenous peoples as well as a country built on slavery; peoples the government has never formally apologized to. We can ignore the truth of this aggressive history, believe it to have been the inevitable consequence overthrowing British colonialism and ridding the country of what the government and most white people then referred to as Indian ""savages"". Then later came the masses of millions of mostly European immigrants; those ancestors who came to America, a consequence of repression, lack of opportunity, religious intolerance they suffered in their native countries. And with them the American demographic changed forever from its colonial past. So now we're a mass of different peoples, mostly adapted to our earlier British colonial heritage, ""connected"" to those who threw off British tyranny, declared their independence, formed a union and soon thereafter a formal constitution of rights under the rule of law. A country that began not wanting to engage in foreign entanglements, fiercely independent, embracing the protestant work ethic, most probably considered inward looking by today's standards. It feels quaint, distant, a different sort of people than most in America now.",english,2016-10-27T09:02:15.713+03:00,opednews.com,US,61423,Throwing off the shackles,0,http://www.opednews.com/populum/cachedimages/s_650_i_ytimg_com_40828_uTKFsgurotc_mqdefault.gif,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Neutral
