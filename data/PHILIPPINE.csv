MANILA, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) â€?This is a tutorial on how to ride the jeepney which is an important mode of mass transportation in many cities and towns in the Philippines. 
Many of you may already be familiar with these rules, etiquette and tricks but for those who are visiting the country for the first time or are returning nationals (balikbayan) who have been away for a long time, you might want to keep this tutorial handy. First of all, not all jeepneys you encounter are as colorful, shiny and clean as the one pictured here. If you are bothered by smoke or the smell of gasoline, remember to always carry and wear a disposable surgical mask. It also helps with, you know, body odor. In most cases, there are no jeepney stops like there are bus stops. Wherever you are, be rest assured that so long as there is room for one more passsenger, the jeepney will stop for you. Speaking of room, when the driver says the capacity of his jeepney is 10 passengers on either side, you canâ€™t argue. Ten means ten, even if only half your butt sits comfortably on the padded seat. Only cash payment is accepted, but you probably already know that. Exact fare is appreciated but Mr. Driver is happy to provide change except very early in the day. â€œBarya lang po sa umaga!â€?No five hundred peso bills in the morning, please. Jeepney fare is passed on from one passenger to another until it reaches the driver. The same is true for any change back due the passenger. It takes a village to ride the jeepney you know. If you donâ€™t want to be bothered by other passengers asking you to pass on the fare to the driver, sit as far as possible from the driver, assuming that premium spot is vacant. The jeepney driver would appreciate it so much if you pay your fare before you start texting on your mobile phone. â€œGod knows who doesnâ€™t pay,â€?says one jeepney sign. There are two phrases you need to learn when riding the jeepney: â€œBayad poâ€?(hereâ€™s my fare) and â€œPara poâ€?(this is my stop). If you donâ€™t speak the language, no worries. Just pass on your fare to the passenger next to you and he or she will know what to do. And if you need to disembark, just knock on the jeepneyâ€™s roof. It also means â€œplease stop.â€?There are discounted fares for students and seniors. Be sure to say â€œone seniorâ€?or â€œone studentâ€?when paying your fare. Otherwise, you pay full fare. Filipinos have learned to respect seniors and people with disabilities. The spot closest to the jeepney entrance (farthest from the driver) is reserved for them. Isnâ€™t that nice? As always, hold on to the hand rails. It can be a very bumpy ride.

MAKATI CITY, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles) â€?When completed by the end of 2016, the Trump Tower in the Philippines will be among the countryâ€™s tallest buildings . But the Trump name may disappear from this upscale residential building. 
Launched in 2012, Trump Tower is a joint venture between Century Properties and the Trump Organization. It will be managed by Century Properties Management Inc. To rise at 250 meters above ground, the 56-story building is designed by award-winning international architectural firm Broadway Malyan. 
â€œItâ€™s really just an iconic, modern building, very tall, very chic, something that really symbolizes everything that a Trump project means,â€?said Eric Trump, son of Donald, and executive vice president of development and acquisition. 
It is located at the corner of Kalayaan Avenue and Salamanca Street in Makati City. 
But today, Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte issued an executive order canceling the building permit of the Trump Tower. 
Duterte called Donald Trump and his organization â€œpersona non grataâ€?for the Republican presidential candidateâ€™s recent comments about the Philippines. 
It will be recalled that in one of his campaign speeches, Trump lumped the Philippines with other countries with terrorism links, calling for the banning Filipinos from immigrating to the United States. Duterte even challenged Trump to a fist fight. 
â€œIf we, Filipinos, are not welcome in the United States, why would we welcome Trump in the Philippines,â€?Duterte said. 
Asked by The Adobo Chronicles what the Philippine government plans to do with the Trump Tower, Duterte replied, â€œI will make it a rehabilitation center for the more than half a million Filipino drug users who surrendered as part of my war on drugs.â€?

MANILA, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) â€?Rappler CEO Maria Ressaâ€™s widely-quoted statement, â€œTime to take back the Internetâ€?might just come back to haunt her. Just in time for Halloween. 
Ressa has been very vocal about the proliferation of â€œfakeâ€?news sites and trolls that have left her online news organization lagging behind in terms of followers and reader engagements. She was particularly critical of entertainer-turned-political blogger, Mocha Uson, who has more than 4 million followers, twice that of Rappler. 
Now, the Philippine government may soon â€˜take back the Internetâ€?from Rappler because it appears it has violated the Philippine Constitution. 
Article XVI, Section 11 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution specifically states that the mass media must be wholly-owned and managed by citizens of the Philippines. 
But Rappler is partly-owned by a foreign company, Omidyar Network. How do we know? Rappler itself told us so way back on November 5, 2015: 
So, before Rappler can take back the Internet, it may first have to give it up!

MANILA, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) â€?Advertising company McCann Worldgroup Philippines will be in charge of crafting the new tourism campaign of the country, the Department of Tourism (DOT) said over the weekend. 
Tourism undersecretary for advocacy and public affairs Katherine de Castro said the P650-million contract with McCann, which won the bid to be the advertising and promotions partner of the DOT for one year, includes the production and positioning of marketing materials, as well as the formulation of a new tourism slogan. 
The Adobo Chronicles spoke with a McCann spokesperson who informed us that the slogan selected for the 2017 tourism year is a take-off from the previous â€œItâ€™s More Fun in the Philippines.â€?
The new slogan is â€œMore Fun in P.I.â€?
P.I. of course stands for Philippine Islands (although the country is now known by the acronym of â€˜PH.â€? 
But it also stands for â€˜P*tang Inaâ€?(Son of a Whore), the cuss words often heard from President Rodrigo Roa Duterte in his speeches and interviews. 
â€œPresident Duterteâ€™s rhetoric and cussing have put the Philippines on the world map and we would like to capitalize on that,â€?the McCann spokesperson said. 
He added: â€œWhy reinvent the wheel when we can just tweak it to reflect the current situation in the Philippines?â€?,english,2016-11-25T08:08:35.160+02:00,adobochronicles.com,US,,Comment on Philippinesâ€?Department Of Tourism Unveils New Promo Slogan"," A Double Entendre by Koel@WritingSouls""",0,https://adobochroniclesdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/img_7221.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,fake,Negative,,,,,
