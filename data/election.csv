Democrat Dr. Brenda Snipes was appointed by Jeb Bush in 2003 and is no stranger to controversy. On October 20, the Sun Sentinal reported that former Oakland Park Commissioner Anne Sallee noticed something troubling about her vote-by-mail ballot. It is missing Constitutional Amendment 2, the medical marijuana question. 
Sallee, now Broward chapter director of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, knows her way around government. Yet she said she spent a week unsuccessfully trying to get someone at the Broward elections office to pay attention to her complaint. 
She was cleared on Wednesday of another election snafu, the early posting of primary election results. Her office also was criticized for sending out inaccurate voter ID cards, and for printing ballots for November that include the word ‚Äúno‚Ä?in the ‚Äúyes‚Ä?line on the county‚Äôs transportation sales surtax question.

MATH SHOWS Trump Would Have Beaten Obama In Romney-Obama Election ¬ª 100percentfedUp.com,"Email For Republican politicians like Ohio Governor John Kasich who refused to get behind Donald J. Trump‚Ä¶it turns out Trump was right‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt need you. In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the ‚Äònever Trumpers‚Ä?from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten him‚Ä?
It‚Äôs easy to glance at Tuesday‚Äôs popular vote ‚Ä?which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 ‚Ä?and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obama‚Äôs 2012 totals in several Midwestern states ‚Ä?Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin ‚Ä?Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What‚Äôs more, she far surpassed Obama‚Äôs 2012 vote total in Florida, the country‚Äôs biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. 
A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the country‚Äôs most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation‚Äôs most critical battleground states. Let‚Äôs look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren‚Äôt yet final because not all precincts have reported.

Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire 
The longer this soap opera drags on, it‚Äôs becoming more and more evident that the Russian government did not ‚Äòhack‚Ä?into the DNC, and Moscow is not feeding John Podesta‚Äôs emails to Wikileaks. For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, this might be a hard pill to swallow. 
The White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that ‚ÄòPutin is hacking the US elections.‚Ä?In response, the President is weighing his options ‚Ä?tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed ‚Äòmalicious cyber-activity‚Ä?tools. 
Even VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying,‚ÄùWe‚Äôre sending a message. We have the capacity to do it.‚Ä?
It seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US? 
What was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected America‚Äôs left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton‚Äôs constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washington‚Äôs new anti-Russia movement. 
On July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote, ‚ÄúThe Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton‚Äôs private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans.‚Ä?
Anyone who was paying attention back then knew this ‚ÄòRussian hack‚Ä?talking point was purely political, but then again, who‚Äôs really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media. 
You can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party‚Äôs hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trump‚Äôs GOP primary success. From that point on, Trump‚Äôs political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words, ‚Äòcomparing one dictator to another.‚Ä?
Never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance . ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own party‚Äôs nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin?‚Ä?said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami. 
Backed by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia ‚Ä?not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona ‚Ä?a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The media‚Äôs coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled, ‚Ä?Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system ,‚Ä?we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: 
‚ÄúHackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state.‚Ä?
But then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: 
‚ÄúThe bureau described the threat as ‚Äúcredible‚Ä?and significant, ‚Äúan eight on a scale of one to 10,‚Ä?Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the state‚Äôs voter registration system for nearly a week.‚Ä?
And then, down to almost nothing‚Ä?
‚ÄúIt turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County.‚Ä?
At no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like, ‚ÄúCyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack.‚Ä?
Are American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French: ‚Äòbottom of the bag‚Ä? where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories ‚Ä?in the middle a national election cycle? It‚Äôs a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election. 
Behind Clinton‚Äôs wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House‚Ä?
On October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager John Podesta ‚Ä?giving them to Wikileaks. 
Soon, there was a queue of ‚Äònational security‚Ä?politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out, ‚ÄúRussia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putin‚Äôs calculus with a strong diplomatic, political, ¬≠cyber and economic response.‚Ä?
According to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima , the only ‚Äòevidence‚Ä?that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged ‚ÄòRussian government hacks‚Äô‚Ä?provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike . No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrike‚Äôs word for it. 
IMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security. 
The Post‚Äôs Nakashima then added: 
‚ÄúThe administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers.‚Ä?
An online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are ‚Äúconsistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,‚Ä?the joint statement said. ‚Äú‚Ä?We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia‚Äôs senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.‚Ä?
Moscow‚Äôs press secretary‚Äôs reply: ‚ÄúThis is some sort of nonsense,‚Ä?said Dmitry Peskov. 
Despite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNN‚Äôs Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really ‚Äúconfirmed‚Ä?that Russia was behind the email hacks ‚Ä?and still no evidence , other than speculative guesswork, has been presented. 
Likewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that ‚ÄúRussia did it,‚Ä?thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesn‚Äôt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona ‚Ä?are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a ‚Ä?parallel universe .‚Ä?
Still, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how ‚Ä?17 US intelligence agencies ‚Ä?aka the ‚ÄúIntelligence Community‚Äù‚Ä?all agreed that Russia did it. 
The announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. 
‚ÄúWe have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,‚Ä?said Clinton. ‚ÄúI find that deeply disturbing.‚Ä?
What‚Äôs even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clinton‚Äôs ‚Ä?7 agencies‚Ä? 
Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. 
What does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podesta‚Äôs emails? Answer: nothing. 
The exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016 . The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda. 
In both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washington‚Äôs flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and ‚Äújournalists‚Ä?working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN ‚Ä?none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Party‚Äôs decree that ‚ÄúRussian is hacking the US election process.‚Ä?If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement: ‚Äú‚Ä?[the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow ‚Ä?the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia‚Äôs senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.‚Ä?According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney , when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are ‚Äòhacking‚Ä?US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a ‚Ä?disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker. ‚Ä?
Under partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid , the FBI also initiated another investigation into ‚Äúpeople linked to the Trump team with Russia.‚Ä?Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI haven‚Äôt come up with anything. 
To be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack ‚Ä?because her staff read it to her from the campaign‚Äôs daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US government‚Äôs much vaunted Intelligence Community . Of course, that‚Äôs the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddam‚Äôs nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraq‚Äôs imaginary ‚ÄúWinnebagos of Death‚Ä?aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks. 
For those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as ‚ÄòWashington Intelligence,‚Ä?I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now, ‚ÄúNo, that was Iraq, that was Bush. We‚Äôre not like that. No, this time it‚Äôs different. This time we are sure the Russians did it!‚Ä?
In 2014, Obama claimed that Kim‚Äôs notorious ‚ÄúBureau 121‚Ä?hacked into Sony Pictures. 
This isn‚Äôt the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign ‚Äòhack‚Ä?and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washington‚Äôs conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called ‚Ä?Bureau 121 .‚Ä?Just like with today‚Äôs ‚ÄúRussian Hack‚Ä?theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White House‚Äôs ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the ‚ÄòRussian Hack‚Ä?claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike . 
Jumping the Shark 
After their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative. 
Soon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to ‚Äúdestabilize and dominate the West.‚Ä?Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of ‚Äòinterfering‚Ä?with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back. The biggest impact of @wikileaks ? Shining a spotlight on Russia‚Äôs attempt to undermine American democracy and Trump‚Äôs refusal to condemn it https://t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5 
‚Ä?Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016 
Clinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only ‚Äòevidence‚Ä?seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as ‚Äòproof‚Ä?that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaign‚Äôs desperate claims. It was embarrassing. 
They could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead. 
Either way, the political strategy here is clear ‚Ä?to shoot the messenger . The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video ‚Ä?their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization. 
Their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz . They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened. 
To prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. ‚ÄúFor the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful,‚Ä?said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race. ‚ÄúI am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year‚Äôs historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week‚Äôs events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,‚Ä?said Clinton. 
The party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it. 
Party Meltdown 
Wasserman Schultz‚Äôs replacement didn‚Äôt fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches ‚Ä?showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives ‚Ä?straight to Hillary Clinton. 
‚Ä?A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper.‚Ä?
‚Ä?A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich.‚Ä?(Source: Daily Caller ) 
Brazile‚Äôs audacious fraud also helped contribute to her party‚Äôs planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: 
. Completely corrupt and still, Brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on FOX News last week. Brazile‚Äôs reputation is so bad now that even CNN has severed ties with her ‚Ä?and that‚Äôs saying a lot. 
In addition, it was also revealed how CNN‚Äôs head political commentator, Gloria Borger , was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of ‚Äòjournalists‚Ä?the Clinton campaign would ‚Äúwork with‚Ä?to gain favorable coverage. You‚Äôd think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNN‚Äôs election coverage. 
Clearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Ever-unbiased CNN's Gloria Borger refers to being in ""GOP hell"" and says she'll ""reach out soon"" to Podesta. Heart-warming #PodestaEmails13 pic.twitter.com/CQFdcJ12Q5

Worse Than Watergate 
Perhaps a bigger scandal which the Obama White House and Clinton campaign operatives would like to bury ‚Ä?is the FBI‚Äôs investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue: 
‚ÄúSome investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isn‚Äôt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president.‚Ä?
There‚Äôs more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe , received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe ‚Ä?a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times . 
So why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia , and cover-up the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps? One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top ‚Ä?to the President himself. 
What 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillary‚Äôs unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clinton‚Äôs server ‚Äúthe same time everybody else learned it through news reports.‚Ä?The President‚Äôs lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that: 
‚ÄúObama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clinton‚Äôs private email server.‚Ä?
So, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails ‚Äúoff grid‚Ä?with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server ‚Ä?maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it. 
Sure, he‚Äôs not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club ‚Ä?caught out lying to the American people. 
On top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as ‚Ä?born classified .‚Ä?The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. 
COVER-UP: John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet (Image: ABC News ) 
It should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action ‚Ä?that the Obama Justice Department (DOJ) is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case. 
On Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case ‚Ä?currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin) who was snared in a ‚Äòsexting‚Ä?scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation? None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik . Who is Kadzik? Zero Hedge reports: 
‚ÄúOh yes. Recall our post from last week, ‚Ä?Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary‚Äôs Benghazi Hearing ‚Ä?in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Benghazi testimony? It was Peter Kadzik.‚Ä?
Oh, and if that wasn‚Äôt good enough, Kadzik was also Podesta‚Äôs lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as ‚Äòbest friends.‚Ä?FOX News confirms: 
‚ÄúFantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,‚Ä?Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta‚Äôs Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. 
To call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it. 
Russia ‚Ä?The Party Scapegoat 
Former Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting: ‚ÄúIronically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.‚Ä?Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. 
‚Ä?Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) October 29, 2016 
Another veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville , was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused ‚Äúthe KGB‚Ä?working with Republicans to ‚Äúhijack the election‚Ä?during his wild rant on MSNBC . 
‚ÄúI think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. That‚Äôs what I think,‚Ä?said Carville. 
Maybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB , and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991. 
These are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many expos√©s revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence ‚Ä?unlike the ‚ÄòRussians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks.‚Ä?
Suffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that ‚ÄòPutin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US.‚Ä?They‚Äôve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-Russian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep ‚Ä?a perfect double entendre . 
The geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washington‚Äôs State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry , Samantha Power , and John Kirby , already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown ‚Ä?that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of US-backed ‚Äòrebels‚Ä?Al Nusra Front, or Nour al-Din al-Zenki. 
With so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about? 
The demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup d‚Äôetat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that it‚Äôs been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks ‚Ä?and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing America‚Äôs own state-run media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said , ‚ÄúWe are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram,‚Ä?He was forced to resign shortly after that. 
What‚Äôs clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although ‚Ä?Russian-backed Rebles Shootting Down MH17 ,‚Ä?and ‚Ä?Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013 ‚Ä?certainly comes to mind. 
That said, it‚Äôs hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of ‚ÄòHacking Into the US Electoral Process.‚Ä?When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders . Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washington‚Äôs claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 Election 
On Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table: 
‚ÄúWe have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. It‚Äôs not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security.‚Ä?
Self-serving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the Obama-Clinton era. 
Knowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere ‚Ä?if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry. 
Still, we‚Äôre waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington ‚Ä?before it‚Äôs too late.

Here is an article that looks at the real story behind one of the more interesting conspiracy theories about the 2016 election: 
Sometimes the real story is even more fascinating than any conspiracy theory. WeAreYourGods 
Wanna bet money that the Weiner laptop, on which the over 600,000 emails were stored in a folder titled ‚ÄúLife Insurance‚Ä? holds information linking the CF to human trafficking and typical elite pedophilia ‚Äúvacations‚Ä? Ever wonder why nobody ever really goes after the Clinton Foundation from a government office? Same old blackmail scheme involving underage sex slaves that was going on during the Boys Town scandal with Lawrence King and elite politicians and business people in the 80‚Äôs. Why would they stop? Brad Dueringer 
It seems the most morally depraved beings are the ones we let run things. But they have help crafting ‚Äúreality‚Ä?with the tribe that owns the media Analyze_This_88 
Barrak Obama and Hillary Clinton are both political scam artists. It‚Äôs amazing that a US President would invent a Russian Hacking conspiracy theory in order to drive a geopolitical agenda. But then again, Bush did the same with Bin Laden and 9/11. 
Clinton on the other hand is pure corruption personified. She‚Äôs should never be allowed near public office.

(AP Photo / Dennis System) 
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) ‚Ä?Following the results of Tuesday night‚Äôs election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19 th . Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. 
‚ÄúPeople all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,‚Ä?Obama told reporters. ‚ÄúMany have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.‚Ä?
Under the President‚Äôs order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday‚Äôs election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. 
Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the president‚Äôs decision. 
‚ÄúCrooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didn‚Äôt allow that to happen. President Obama doesn‚Äôt care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.‚Ä?
The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. 
‚ÄúWe have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.‚Ä?
Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. 
‚ÄúMost people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes , but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19 th . What the people are actually voting for are their states‚Ä?electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.‚Ä?
Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the President‚Äôs Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. 
‚Äú[The electoral college] is a f‚Äîking joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise . Everyone should have an equal vote, and that‚Äôs just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. It‚Äôs time to bring our system into the 21 st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.‚Ä?
Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,‚Ä?Obama said. ‚ÄúWhy did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasn‚Äôt this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?‚Ä?Obama said. ‚ÄúIf all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.‚Ä?
If you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19 th election , you can call the Obama administration‚Äôs special election hotline at (785) 273-0325.

Smoking Gun In Massive Election Fraud Discovered By Investigators    
Black Box Voting, founded in 2003, performs nonpartisan investigative reporting on elections in an attempt to stop vote rigging. 

You may be wondering what the term ""black box"" means. A ""black box"" system is non-transparent; its functions are hidden from the public. Elections, of course, should not be black box systems. 

Here is a link to a free copy of the book, Black Box Voting HERE. 

Author Bev Harris became known for groundbreaking work on electronic voting machines, which can remove transparency of the vote count.

In September 1980, as violence and civil war erupted throughout Central America, a quiet American left Harvard Law School to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries in northern Honduras. Around him, the United States-backed military dictatorship hunted Marxists and cracked down on the Catholic clergy for preaching empowerment to peasant farmers. But some locals also looked warily on the bearded and mop-haired Midwesterner in their midst. Just a few hours south, the Central Intelligence Agency was using Honduras as a staging ground in its covert war against Latin American communism, with right-wing forces training for operations in El Salvador and Nicaragua. ‚ÄúSome of the people were wondering what‚Äôs going on, who is this guy?‚Ä?Tim Kaine, then a 22-year-old volunteer and now the Democratic nominee for vice president, said in an interview.

In Honduras, his recitation of the traditional Catholic mealtime blessing changed to ‚ÄúLord give bread to those who hunger, and hunger for justice to those who have bread.‚Ä?Honduran military leaders, American officials and even Pope John Paul II viewed liberation theology suspiciously, as dangerously injecting Marxist beliefs into religious teaching.

Over the course of this year‚Äôs US presidential election, which has been nothing if not bizarre, some have repeatedly speculated that the election may not actually happen at all if an opportunely timed terrorist attack or other major event occurred at just the right moment, leading to a suspension of the November election. Now, these theories appear to have more credence as sources within US intelligence have contacted Pat Milton, a CBS News senior investigative producer, warning him that terrorist attacks in three US states are highly likely come this Monday, the day before the US election. US Intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al Qaeda, not ISIS, could be planning attacks in New York, Texas, and Virginia. No specific locations within those three states were mentioned. 
US authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously, though CBS News ‚Ä?sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed. According to CBS , counter-terrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an ‚Äúabundance of caution.‚Ä?
Earlier this week, there were also warnings that ‚Äúpolling places‚Ä?could be seen as ‚Äúattractive targets‚Ä?for ‚Äúlone wolf‚Ä?attackers by individuals motivated by ‚Äúviolent extremist ideologies, sovereign citizen or other extremist activity.‚Ä?This has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worst-case scenarios. One FBI official told CBS : 
The counter-terrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States. The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety. 
However, what‚Äôs interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al Qaeda as opposed to the Islamic State. In the Syrian ‚Äúcivil‚Ä?war, the US has been actively helping al Qaeda there, grouping their Syrian branch ‚Ä?the al Nusra Front ‚Ä?in with the ‚Äúmoderate rebels‚Ä?they support. Therefore, al Qaeda‚Äôs ability to launch attacks within the US has been directly aided by US intelligence, making this announcement incredibly suspect. 
It‚Äôs also worth pointing out that al Qaeda, since its inception, has been a product of the US intelligence community. In the 1980s they were essentially created by the US to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. Ever since, they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of US wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically. 
It is also interesting that the threat is al Qaeda and NOT the Islamic State. The Islamic State has been the terrorist ‚Äúbogeyman‚Ä?of recent years and their involvement in any threat, real or imagined, is useful justification for escalating US involvement in Syria. It seems highly likely that the Islamic State was left out due to recent revelations from WikiLeaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the Clinton Foundation. 
It is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass, it will be a big help for Hillary. Hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to WikiLeaks‚Ä?near constant releases of her campaign chair‚Äôs emails, but also due to the FBI‚Äôs ‚Äúmutiny‚Ä?which led them to re-open a probe into Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server. Any terror attack would give Clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in Syria and the rest of the Middle East. 
However, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, it is also possible that a terrorist attack on US soil would give President Obama the authority to either postpone or outright cancel the election, something he could not normally do except in the event of extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, only time will tell which theory is correct, compelling us to stay vigilant in the meantime.

By Joseph Jankowski 
An organization which has the aim to separate the state of California from the Union of the United States is set to hold a meeting at the state capitol in Sacramento on Wednesday, November 9, 2016, the day after the presidential election. 
The Yes California Independence Campaign , which is based in San Diego, describes itself as a ‚Äúnonviolent campaign to establish the country of California using any and all legal and constitutional means to do so.‚Ä?
The group is currently trying to qualify a citizen‚Äôs initiative in 2018 to get a referendum for secession on the ballot in 2019, reports SF Gate . They will be in Sacramento in hopes to gather support for the state‚Äôs exit, or the ‚ÄúCalexit,‚Ä?as they call it. 
‚ÄúIn our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children,‚Ä?reads Yes California ‚Äôs official website. 
The group‚Äôs page reads on: 
Although charity is part of our culture, when you consider that California‚Äôs infrastructure is falling apart, our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country, we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities, poverty rates remain high, income inequality continues to expand, and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today, now is not the time for charity. However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to self-determination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law.
It is about California taking its place in the world, standing as an equal among nations. We believe in two fundamental truths: (1) California exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world, and (2) California could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a U.S. state. 
Yes California ‚Äôs website lays out 9 different points covering topics the group believes will benefit from a California exit from the US, including education, peace and security, debt and taxes and immigration. 
One blog post on their page draws parallels with a ‚ÄúCalexit‚Ä?and the recent referendum known as ‚ÄúBrexit‚Ä?that passed in the UK in June which showed that most British people are ready for their country to leave the EU. 
The push for secession is nothing new to California. In 1941 the mayor of Port Orford, Oregon, Gilbert Gable, proposed the idea to push the Oregon counties of Curry, Josephine, Jackson, and Klamath to join with the California counties of Del Norte, Siskiyou, and Modoc to form a new state, later named Jefferson. 
Modoc County of Northern California voted in 2013 to join neighboring Siskiyou County in a push to secede from the State of California . 
In 2014, two counties in northern California petitioned for the right to form a 51st State of America, which they also wanted to name Jefferson.

Donald Trump‚Äôs deplorable supporters aren‚Äôt waiting for the election results to start spilling blood. 
They‚Äôve been threatening bloody violence ever since Trump began claiming that the election is ‚Äúrigged‚Ä?in favor of Hillary Clinton. And Trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places. 
In Texas last week, a Trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of Trump‚Äôs stupid hats and a ‚ÄúDeplorables‚Ä?T-shirt to vote. 
Election code prohibits any person from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. 
Of course, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules don‚Äôt apply to them. 
Well, now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped Trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down. 
At Collin College in Plano, Texas a Trump sign was discovered zip-tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places. 
But when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside. The blades sliced into the volunteer‚Äôs hands and drew blood, requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal. 
‚ÄúIt just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody who‚Äôs probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other,‚Ä?local Democratic Party campaign chair Steve Spainhouer said in response . ‚ÄúI think most people have already made their minds up at this point how they‚Äôre going to vote and so there‚Äôs nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful.‚Ä?
Here‚Äôs the video via KTVT . 
Frankly, this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism. Trump‚Äôs supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as Election Day approaches. And if Trump loses, his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup. 
Clearly, these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger. But you won‚Äôt hear Donald Trump condemning this act of violence. After all, he is the one inciting it.

Saturday Night Live has helped bring quite a bit of levity to this otherwise horrific election year but in the final episode before the election, before we as a nation go to the polls and decide if we want to be extraordinary or ‚Äúdeplorable,‚Ä?the cast of Saturday Night Live could not help but drop the act and get real with America. 
It began as it normally does, with Alec Baldwin‚Äôs masterful Donald Trump character and Kate McKinnon‚Äôs excellent portrayal of Hillary Clinton (if she spent all day every day mainlining a dangerous mixture of sugar and caffeine). 
‚ÄúI never use emails,‚Ä?Trump says in the cold opener. ‚ÄúI use a very private, very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it It‚Äôs called Twitter.‚Ä?
After he is informed that everyone can see his tweets, ‚ÄúTrump‚Ä?replies: 
‚ÄúReally? And I‚Äôm still in this thing? America you must really hate this lady.‚Ä?
After a scathing rebuke of the media‚Äôs decision to ignore Trump‚Äôs cozy relationship with Putin, the KKK, and the FBI and instead focus on something as meaningless as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails, something magical happened: McKinnon and Baldwin dropped the facade and got serious. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this,‚Ä?Baldwin says. ‚ÄúI just feel gross all the time about this. Don‚Äôt you all feel gross?‚Ä?he added, addressing the audience. 
McKinnon agrees and the two embark on a ‚Äúfriendship montage‚Ä?through the city before returning to the stage. Then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year. ‚ÄúNone of this would have mattered if you don‚Äôt vote,‚Ä?Baldwin says. 
‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt tell you who to vote for, but on Tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in,‚Ä?McKinnon finishes.

In reaction to Donald Trump‚Äôs victory, The Simpsons decided to update their 2000 prediction of a Trump presidency. 
In 2000, the show showed a glimpse into the future where President Lisa Simpson inherited an economic mess from ‚ÄúPresident Trump.‚Ä?Well, now that fictional story line has become a horrifying reality.

Hopefully, the financial despair the fictional President Trump never becomes a reality, but seeing as he has no experience, is a businessman who‚Äôs not as good as he says he is, and The Simpsons have been right thus far, the future‚Äôs looking pretty bleak. 
Here‚Äôs the original clip of President Lisa Simpson calling out a Donald Trump presidency for his fiscal fallout and bad economy: 
Early on into Trump‚Äôs campaign, The Simpsons satirized the reality TV host turned president-elect by having Homer Simpson somehow at the campaign rollout and falling into Trump‚Äôs hair. If we could only go back to that moment and enjoy the comedy over reality. 
Now we have to reap what we‚Äôve sown, or rather what the less than half of voting Americans have sown considering Trump only won with the Electoral College and lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in his own words, big league. 
Most of us with The Simpsons were very wrong with the prediction as well.

By Susan Duclos - All News PipeLine Progressive liberals, George Soros and his merry band of paid protesters, and the mainstream media are certainly giving new meaning to William Shakespeare's "" Fight to the last gasp ,"" quote, but what none of them seem to realize yet as they cry, scream, riot and offer their mea culpa's is that the fight is over, the election is finished, their opponents have gone home to celebrate and they are doing nothing but flailing in the wind while grunting incoherently.While anyone can see the headlines about the third day of protests and riots, and how those that are incapable of understanding quite how elections work and are holding out for a pipe-dream that maybe they can make electors of the electoral college change their vote, what many are missing is how the mainstream media is attempting to suck more air out oxygen tanks that have gone empty.... and they have no one to blame but themselves. THE ULTIMATE LOSERS IN THE 2016 ELECTION - THE MSM For the last year and a half we have witnessed and reported on the mainstream media's unrelenting and unapologetic campaign against Donald Trump, where 91 percent of the reporting since the party's convention, where he was named the GOP nominee, has been studied and found to have been negative, but even before that they treated Trump as if he didn't stand a chance to win that nomination.We have noted and reported via Wikileaks releases how that very same MSM had colluded with the DNC and the Clinton campaign in order to influence the public to elect Hillary Clinton.We have also observed and reported how Trump supporters were constantly labeled and portrayed as racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, uneducated, uninformed, white nationalist deplorables, just to name a few of the colorful descriptors.How did that work out for them?Despite their biased reporting and throwing everything, including the kitchen sink, at Trump, we now have President-Elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, to be sworn in on January 20, 2017. While Hillary Clinton will fade into obscurity and the protesters will eventually go home just to criticize everything Trump does for the next four (maybe 8?) years, and progressives will get over their sworn ""revolution"" within the party between liberals and moderate Democrats, the ultimate losers are not Clinton supporters, celebrities that swore to leave the country if Trump won, nor Democrats as a party.... it is the mainstream media that was rendered irrelevant, crushed by a wave of ""deplorables"" and alternative media bypassing their once-influential status to communicate without their fasle prism of 'truth.' MSM'S LAST GASP Now they are offering their mea culpas, dedicating countless hours and ink to explaining and justifying how they were so wrong in their predictions that they knew ahead of time were based on a false premise, and taking their ""last gasp"" by swearing to ""rededicate"" themselves to reporting honestly, while at the same time claiming they reported on ""both candidates fairly.""I kid you not.Below is a letter by Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. and Dean Baquet, the publisher and editor of the New York Times:First point is that if they had been reporting ""fairly"" as claimed in the letter above, they would not need to ""rededicate"" themselves to honesty. Secondly, they did not strive ""to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences,"" of Trump supporters, rather they maligned, criticized, belittled and mocked anybody that did not agree with their superior and smug political opinion.While it is to be expected that Trump supporters, verbally abused on a regular basis will not forget nor forgive media outlets such as the Times, the Public Editor Liz Spayd, who works independently, with the job of examining The Times with an eye to protecting journalistic integrity and good practices, describes the reaction from other members of the public to their reporting. Readers are sending letters of complaint at a rapid rate. Here¬ís one that summed up the feelings succinctly, from Kathleen Casey of Houston: ""Now, that the world has been upended and you are all, to a person, in a state of surprise and shock, you may want to consider whether you should change your focus from telling the reader what and how to think, and instead devote yourselves to finding out what the reader (and nonreaders) actually think."" Another letter, from Nick Crawford of Plymouth, Mich., made a similar point. ""Perhaps the election result would not be such a surprise if your reporting had acknowledged what ordinary Americans care about, rather than pushing the limited agenda of your editors,"" he wrote. ""Please come down from your New York City skyscraper and join the rest of us."" What Ms. Spayd does not acknowledge is that their reporting will not and cannot change as long as their publisher and editor, the ones that wrote the letter in the image above, continue to insist their reporting during the campaign season was in any way fair, or to even pretend they attempted to ""understand and reflect all political perspectives."" What Ms. Spayd also does not address is the fact that five different New York Times' reporters accepted the invitations for the off-the-record gatherings to ""frame the HRC message"" with the Clinton campaign staff before her campaign launched, including, Gail Collins, Jonathan Martin, Maggie Haberman, Patrick Healy, and Amy Chozick, all of which consistently penned hit pieces against Trump.It is heartening to see that outlets like the New York Times are being called to the carpet by their own readers, as well as admitting they are losing subscribers, because while Trump supporters were maligned and lied about, their readers were misinformed and lied to . The country¬ís major news organizations, as surprised as anybody by Donald J. Trump¬ís ascension to the presidency, faced a question from their audiences on Wednesday that was laced with a sense of betrayal and anger: How did you get it so wrong? The question came in letters. (""To editors and writers of The NYT,"" one reader wrote, ""you were so wrong for so long. You misled your readers and were blinded by your own journalistic bigotry."") It came in Facebook posts. (""You were in a bubble and weren¬ít paying attention to your fellow Americans,"" the filmmaker Michael Moore wrote in a post shared more than 100,000 times.) Most ominously, it came in the form of canceled subscriptions, something that will surely be monitored. Former Times' reporter Michael Goodwin offers the Times some free advice : Using an outside law firm or even in-house reporters, he must assess how and why Baquet made the decision to sever the paper from its roots. He must assess the impact on reporters and editors, and whether they felt pressure to conform their stories to Baquet¬ís political bias. Whatever the findings, the publisher must insist that the standards of fairness again become a fundamental tenet in the news room. As an added guarantee, he must insist that the paper enlarge its thinking about diversity to include journalists who disagree with the Times embedded liberal slant. There has to be a difference of perspective to judge where fairness lies. Readers, and former readers, should be part of the process. Many already know that the paper must get its head out of parochial New York and into the hearts and minds of Americans everywhere. This is about survival. If it doesn¬ít change now, the Gray Lady¬ís days surely are numbered. BOTTOM LINE Frankly I believe traditional media's days are numbered whatever they do, and they are on their last gasp. There are too many Independent journalists and alternative news sites from both sides of the political aisle that are rendering them irrelevant. While alternative media has its own set of biases, the majority always provide links, documents when available, video clips and other methods for readers to verify, research and come to their own conclusions, something mainstream media doesn't want readers to do because they feel they have the right to lead the public where the MSM wants them to go, rather than inform the public and trust them to make their own determinations.",english,2016-11-13T19:46:48.693+02:00,allnewspipeline.com,US,78393,"Readers Enraged By MSM Election Reporting - 'You Misled Your Readers, Blinded By Journalistic Bigotry'",0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Rigged elections. Vigilante observers. Angry voters. The claims, threats and passions surrounding the presidential race have led communities around the U.S. to move polling places out of schools or cancel classes on Election Day. 
The fear is that the ugly rhetoric of the campaign could escalate into confrontations and even violence in school hallways, endangering students. 
‚ÄúIf anybody can sit there and say they don‚Äôt think this is a contentious election, then they aren‚Äôt paying much attention,‚Ä?said Ed Tolan, police chief in Falmouth, Maine, which decided to call off classes on Election Day and put additional officers on duty Nov. 8. 
{snip} 
Schools are popular polling places because they have plenty of parking and are usually centrally located. It‚Äôs difficult to say how many school-based polling places have been moved this year, given how decentralized the voting process is across the country. 
But state and local officials say voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. 
‚ÄúThere is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering, that we didn‚Äôt have 15 or 20 years ago. What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something?‚Ä?said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. ‚ÄúIf that happens at a school, then that‚Äôs certainly concerning.‚Ä?
{snip} 
Easton Superintendent John Reinhart wanted to get voting out of schools altogether but was rebuffed by county election officials. So the school board canceled classes on Election Day. 
‚ÄúIf you take the personalities away and cast the emotion with the election aside, one has to ask the question: ‚ÄòAre our schools the best places for that activity to take place?'‚Ä?he said. ‚ÄúI just think we‚Äôve reached the point where we need to look at other locations.‚Ä?

A record number of illegal aliens have crossed the U.S.- Mexico border and are in U.S. Border Patrol custody in Texas‚Ä?Rio Grande Valley Sector (RGV), according to the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC). Border Patrol Agent and NBPC President Brandon Judd spoke exclusively with Breitbart Texas and condemned the leadership of the Border Patrol‚Äôs parent agency, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), for allegedly ‚Äúkeeping this information secret‚Ä?ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
‚ÄúWe are at breaking point. We have the highest number of illegal aliens in custody in history in Border Patrol‚Äôs RGV Sector and this information has been kept from the American public,‚Ä?said Agent Judd. ‚ÄúThe talk of amnesty has once again created pull factors and encouraged people from all over the world to cross Mexico and then cross our porous southern border to illegally enter the U.S. We are simply overwhelmed.‚Ä?{snip} 
Agent Judd told Breitbart Texas that Americans should vote their conscience, but they should do so with all of the information available. ‚ÄúThis is an issue of the federal government restricting crucial information from the public ahead of a presidential election and it is unacceptable. Americans deserve to know the truth. Our Border Patrol agents deserve for Americans to know what they are really facing. Too many Border Patrol agents have given their lives and left loved ones to grieve for CBP leadership to play these types of political games ahead of such an impactful election.‚Ä?
{snip} 
Historically, CBP, Border Patrol‚Äôs parent agency, has had to correct false assertions and denials. Perhaps the most glaring example occurred in June 2014 when an official CBP Twitter account directly accused this reporter of publishing a false report, only to later admit the report was accurate and true . 
{snip} 
UPDATE: Breitbart Texas received this response from CBP: 
First, the number in custody in RGV is less than half what is was in June 2014. 
Also, I would refer you to Secretary Johnson‚Äôs statement about southwest border security issued October 17. In it, the Secretary addresses the specific issue of unaccompanied children and family units. The statement includes statistics for the full year of fiscal year 2016.

Profound rifts among groups lie beneath the close presidential contest, underscoring the country‚Äôs fundamental political divisions not only by gender, education, race and ethnicity but also by factors ranging from religious belief to residential area. 
{snip} 
There‚Äôs a 22 point gender gap in the contest, nearly double the norm in elections since 1976. And that pales compared with other gaps‚Ä?4 points between college- and non-college-educated whites, 65 points between whites and nonwhites, 66 points between rural and urban residents and 97 points between white evangelicals and likely voters who don‚Äôt profess a particular religion. 
{snip} 
Trump is doing less well with Republicans and GOP leaners who wanted someone else to win the nomination; he has 75 percent support in this group, with 15 percent going to Clinton, 7 percent to Johnson or Stein. Two factors mitigate the damage: leaning Republicans have grown more apt to say they supported Trump in the first place (47 percent, up from 40 percent in August), and there‚Äôs no slippage evident in turnout among leaning Republicans who preferred someone else for the nomination. 
{snip} 
Differences among groups abound, with one of the largest between evangelical white Protestants‚Äìa core Republican constituency‚Äìand those who profess no religion. The former back Trump by 77 to 19 percent; the latter, Clinton by 64 to 25 percent. The groups are identical in size, each making up 17 percent of likely voters. The gap between them is typical. 
{snip} 
The racial gap, while wide, is narrower than typical. Whites support Trump by 53 to 39 percent; nonwhites favor Clinton, 72 to 21 percent. But that 65 point divide is a bit smaller than the average in exit polls since 1976, 73 points, as well as 26 points smaller than the record racial gap, 91 points, in 1984. That‚Äôs mostly because of lower support for Clinton among nonwhites who are not black or Hispanic; 48 percent back her, versus 66 percent for Barack Obama in 2012. 
In a particularly prominent result in this election, gender and education continue to spell broad differences among whites. College-educated white women, consistently strong for Clinton all year, now back her by 59 to 32 percent. Non-college-educated white men, steadily one of Trump‚Äôs best groups, support him 64 to 26 percent. 
White men with a college degree continue to divide closely, making them a battleground group. Non-college-educated white women‚Äìthe largest of these groups, at 24 percent of likely voters‚Äìhave wavered in their support, generally for Trump but by varying margins. Lately, they look more settled on Trump, now by 61 to 33 percent.

Americans aren‚Äôt the only ones motivated by Tuesday‚Äôs election. The presidential race has immigrants from around the world racing to the U.S.-Mexican border, as the cartels exploit a powerful narrative: get into the U.S. while you still can. 
‚ÄúSmugglers are telling them that they need to come across now while there‚Äôs a chance,‚Ä?said Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in Tucson, Ariz., whose views were echoed by another agent in Texas. 
‚ÄúPeople think if one candidate wins, certain things will happen, like a giant wall being built and then they can never get through,‚Ä?said Chris Cabrera, an agent in the Rio Grande Valley. ‚ÄúAnother faction believes that if the other candidate wins, they‚Äôll get amnesty if they‚Äôre here by a certain date.‚Ä?
Those two competing narratives‚Äìtriggered by the rhetoric of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, respectively‚Äìare driving immigration numbers the Border Patrol hasn‚Äôt seen in years in some sectors. 
‚ÄúWe are overwhelmed,‚Ä?said a veteran agent in McAllen, Texas. ‚ÄúWe are seeing 800 to 1,000 apprehensions every night.‚Ä?
In fiscal 2016, the Border Patrol apprehended 117,200 immigrants from Central America, almost one-third of all apprehensions border-wide‚Äìand 5,000 more than during the so-called surge of 2014. The agency also apprehended 5,000 Haitians, up from just 700 last year. The number of immigrants claiming to be from Africa and Asia also is up. 
{snip} 
The poverty and violence plaguing many of these countries helps push immigrants north, Beeson said. Pull factors include available and good-paying jobs in the U.S. and immigration policy that provides work permits and freedom for immigrants while the courts adjudicate their ‚Äòasylum‚Ä?claim. 
‚ÄúWhen you stop somebody, you ask their name and the first thing they tell you is‚Äì‚ÄòI‚Äôm here for asylum, I can‚Äôt go home because they‚Äôll kill me.‚Ä?. . . When it takes a good five or six minutes just to get their name out of them, they have a rehearsed story,‚Ä?said Cabrera. ‚ÄúOnce they get those papers saying they can pass through our checkpoint, we‚Äôll never see them again.‚Ä?
Del Cueto said the agents are ‚Äúnot getting any backing‚Ä?from D.C. and ‚Äúwe need to start enforcing every single immigration law we have on the books.‚Ä?

There‚Äôs a lot of accusations going around that the 2016 election is rigged. From Democrats suggesting Russia is tampering with the presidential election to a plethora of documents and undercover video that proves Democrats are trying their darnedest to sway the outcome. 
President Obama has laughed off the notion that Bernie Sanders was forced out by the DNC and believes Donald Trump is out of his mind for suggesting elections are rigged. And of course, Obama would never admit that Hillary Clinton could do something wrong. But candidate Obama, in 2008, sure was concerned that the election might be rigged against him. 
Video of him answering a campaign question has surfaced to put to rest the notion that he doesn‚Äôt believe in the possibility: 
‚ÄúWell, I tell you what: it helps in Ohio that we‚Äôve got Democrats in charge of the machines. [Cheering] But look, I come from Chicago, so I want to be honest, it‚Äôs not as if it‚Äôs just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past, sometimes Democrats have too.

REUTERS 
Down a Georgia country road, camouflaged members of the Three Percent Security Force have mobilized for rifle practice, hand-to-hand combat training ‚Ä?and an impromptu campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. 
‚ÄúHow many people are voting for Trump? Ooh-rah!‚Ä?asks Chris Hill, a paralegal who goes by the code name ‚ÄúBloodagent.‚Ä?
‚ÄúOoh-rah!‚Ä?shout a dozen militia members in response, as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend. 
As the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton. 
They say they won‚Äôt fire the first shot, but they‚Äôre not planning to leave their guns at home, either. 
Trump‚Äôs populist campaign has energized militia members like Hill, who admire the Republican mogul‚Äôs promise to deport illegal immigrants, stop Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexico border. Trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be ‚Äúrigged,‚Ä?and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win. At least one paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud. 
Armed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early 1990s, fueled by confrontations in Ruby Ridge, Idaho and Waco, Texas, culminating in a militia sympathizer‚Äôs 1995 bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people. 
Their numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years, driven by fears that President Barack Obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, estimates there were 276 active militias last year, up from 42 in 2008. 
In recent years, armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of land-use disputes in the western United States. Federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon. 
Many fear Clinton would push the county further to the left. 
‚ÄúThis is the last chance to save America from ruin,‚Ä?Hill said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised I was able to survive or suffer through eight years of Obama without literally going insane, but Hillary is going to be more of the same.‚Ä?

EXTREMIST GROUPS EMBOLDENED 
The Oath Keepers, a prominent anti-government force that sent gun-toting members to the 2014 race riots in Ferguson, Missouri, called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud. 
An hour south of Atlanta, the Three Percent Security Force started the day around the campfire, taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range. They whooped with approval when blasts from one member‚Äôs high-powered rifle knocked down a tree. 
The group operates independently, but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government. The movement draws its name from the notion that no more than 3 percent of the American population fought in the Revolutionary War against Britain. 
Amid the war games, Hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on Washington if Clinton wins. 
He said he doesn‚Äôt want his members leading the way, but they will defend the protesters if need be. His group will not hesitate to act if a President Clinton tries to disarm gun owners, he said. 
‚ÄúI will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen, and prevent them from being disarmed, and I will fight and I will kill and I may die in the process,‚Ä?said Hill, who founded the militia several years ago. 
Trump‚Äôs candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law, said Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
‚ÄúPrior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape,‚Ä?he said. ‚ÄúNow these ideas are legitimized.‚Ä?
Over the past week, some prominent Trump supporters have hinted at violence. 
‚ÄúIf Trump loses, I‚Äôm grabbing my musket,‚Ä?former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh wrote on Twitter last week. Conservative commentator Wayne Root fantasized about Clinton‚Äôs death while speaking at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Sunday. 
Back in Georgia, the Three Percent Security Force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun. They then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides, ready for whatever may come. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve building up for this, just like the Marines,‚Ä?he said. ‚ÄúWe are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come.‚Ä?Share On:",english,2016-11-02T19:24:01.278+02:00,amtvmedia.com,US,,U.S. militia girds for trouble as presidential election nears,0,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/download.jpeg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

LEW ROCKWELL 
( Source: The 2nd American Civil War by Richard Hubal, via MN Artists ) 
Nick Giambruno: The US presidential election is only days away. What are the country‚Äôs greatest problems right now? 
Doug Casey: Domestically, I‚Äôd say the continual and accelerating loss of freedom, compounded by the prospect of what I suspect will be the biggest financial/economic crisis of modern times. What might that crisis be like? That‚Äôs unpredictable, although the odds are it will be unlike any others that are still fresh in people‚Äôs memories, simply because people tend to be most prepared for the things that have most recently scared them. The big problems usually come from an unexpected quarter, and/or at an unexpected time. Like the monetary crisis of 1998, that materialized in Thailand. 
That said, the question remains of where to look. It could come from outside American borders, in the form of war. War is perhaps the worst thing that can happen, not only for the destruction it will cause in itself, but because it will immensely exacerbate America‚Äôs domestic problems. As Bourne famously said, ‚ÄúWar is the health of the State.‚Ä?Certainly, the US government is actively provoking other governments in a score of places around the world. The next war could be serious, not just a sports war, like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Nick Giambruno: In 2000, the federal government‚Äôs debt was just over $5 trillion. Now, it‚Äôs about $20 trillion. It doesn‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs in power. The debt continues to grow exponentially. Unless the government makes radical cuts to welfare and the military‚Äîwhich won‚Äôt happen no matter who is elected‚Äîit will grow indefinitely. 
If Americans are destined to be indebted serfs no matter who‚Äôs in power, do the elections even matter? 
Doug Casey: If the economy goes off of the deep end over the next year‚Äîand I think it will‚Äîthe US government is going to be running much bigger deficits. Spending is going to go up for welfare. Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security‚Äîthat‚Äôs already about two-thirds of the US government‚Äôs budget. Military spending is also going up. All that is going to go up, regardless of who wins the election on November 8. 
We could easily see a trillion dollar deficit, perhaps much more. Now, where are they going to get all that money? The Chinese aren‚Äôt going to lend it to the US anymore. They‚Äôre basically going to finance the deficit by selling the debt to the Federal Reserve. And that means creating more currency units out of thin air. 
But, on the other hand, the average guy‚Äîand for that matter, most businesses‚Äîaren‚Äôt borrowing money now. They‚Äôre too afraid. They don‚Äôt want to be in debt. The question is: As this comes to a real climax, are we going to have something resembling a runaway inflation in the dollar? Or are we going to have a massive credit collapse, which could be caused by defaults on bonds, house mortgages, student loans, or auto loans? I‚Äôm not sure which is going to happen. I mean, you buy a car now in the US, it costs you what a house did a couple generations ago. It all floats on a sea of debt. I‚Äôm just betting on financial chaos. That is the safe bet. 
No matter which way this election goes, it‚Äôs going to be ugly. 
Both candidates, Trump and Clinton, are disastrous. To me, it‚Äôs a sign of how degraded the US has become. About a year ago, they gave us a choice between Hillary, the wife of a previous president, pretty much playing the role of Argentina‚Äôs Evita, Juan Peron‚Äôs brassy wife. And Jeb Bush, the brother of one previous president and the son of another. The US has gone so far downhill that we can only choose which family dynasty we prefer to rule. If only a Kennedy, a Roosevelt, or a Rockefeller could be thrown into the mix as well‚Ä?Maybe next time. Although I think we‚Äôre due for a general or two. 
Elections are, quite frankly, meaningless. These two corrupt parties, the Republicrats, and the Demopublicans, run by political hacks and funded by interest groups, simply appoint the people that they want and then present the American people with the illusion of a choice. The people who run these parties have become increasingly bold and arrogant. They‚Äôre absolutely horrible creatures, the same types that used to thrive in the Soviet Union. Americans should be ashamed of themselves for treating them with any respect at all. 
However, if forced to choose between the two candidates, I would definitely go for Trump, simply because he‚Äôs something of an outsider. The media, Hollywood, academia, and the Establishment hate him. And I believe he hates them. If elected, he will likely overturn a lot of apple carts in Washington and break a lot of rice bowls of people who live off the Deep State. That would be an excellent thing. It‚Äôs also possible he would retract most of Obama‚Äôs Executive Orders, and fire a bunch of supernumeraries. But he might replace them with a bunch of his own. 
However, it‚Äôs clear Trump has all kinds of dangerous authoritarian tendencies‚Äîdon‚Äôt forget his endorsement of torture and the killing of families of accused terrorists as a policy. He also has all kinds of really silly and destructive economic notions‚Äîhe appears to think he can cut ‚Äúdeals‚Ä?with foreign governments. That has nothing to do with the concept of free trade. He‚Äôs threatened punitive tariffs, something that would immensely aggravate The Greater Depression. Worse, since as a businessman he‚Äôs associated with the free market‚Äîunfortunately, and incorrectly‚Äîcapitalism will wind up being blamed for this depression as well as a result. 
Incidentally, I believe‚Äîas I have for over a year‚Äîthat Trump is going to win. Why? It‚Äôs not just the immense enthusiasm of his supporters, as opposed to the lukewarm support that Hillary gets. It‚Äôs that Bernie Sanders was the other ‚Äúprotest‚Ä?candidate in this election. His numerous and enthusiastic supporters believe‚Äîcorrectly‚Äîthat Hillary and the Democratic machine stole the nomination from him. They‚Äôre genuinely pissed off. I believe only the most oblivious ones will vote for Hillary. A few might be mad enough to want to burn the house down by voting for Trump. 
I haven‚Äôt heard anyone talking about the absence of the Bernie-istas. I don‚Äôt keep my finger on the pulse of the hoi polloi . But, if I‚Äôm right, it will result in a landslide for Trump. 
Unfortunately, Trump is no libertarian‚Äîbut neither is the dim-bulb candidate of the Libertarian Party. That said Trump is a lot better than Hillary‚Äîthis is no time for a corrupt, hostile, elderly, debilitated, mildly demented Statist to become president. So, sure, I‚Äôd prefer Trump. 
Am I going to vote for him? I don‚Äôt believe in being complicit in a criminal act, so I don‚Äôt vote. 
Nick Giambruno: Please elaborate‚Ä?
Doug Casey: There are at least five reasons not to vote: Voting in a political election is unethical. The political process is one of institutionalized coercion and force. If you disapprove of those things, then you shouldn‚Äôt participate in them, even indirectly. Voting compromises your privacy. It gets your name in yet another government computer database. Voting, as well as registering, entails hanging around government offices and dealing with petty bureaucrats. Most people can find something more enjoyable or productive to do with their time. Voting encourages politicians. A vote against one candidate‚Äîa major, and quite understandable, the reason why most people vote‚Äîis always interpreted as a vote for his opponent. And even though you may be voting for the lesser of two evils, the lesser of two evils is still evil. It amounts to giving the candidate a tacit mandate to impose his will on society. Your vote doesn‚Äôt count. Politicians like to say it counts because it is to their advantage to get everyone into a busybody mode. But, statistically, one vote in scores of millions makes no more difference than a single grain of sand on a beach. That‚Äôs entirely apart from the fact that officials manifestly do what they want, not what you want, once they are in office. 
Nick Giambruno: What about voting for the Libertarian Party? 
Doug Casey: The Libertarian Party once had a claim to being the party of principle, back in the days when people like John Hospers, Harry Browne, and Ron Paul were their candidates. Then they for some reason put forward the empty suit Bob Barr, an ex-Congressman. 
It appears that the Libertarian Party has been captured by the Republicans, which is surprisingly clever on the Republicans‚Ä?part. Now they have two parties that are registered in all 50 states. It‚Äôs kind of a backup system to the regular Republican Party. They‚Äôll need a backup since the old GOP is a dead duck. 
Regarding Gary Johnson, I don‚Äôt know what his philosophical beliefs, if any, are. I suspect neither, does he. The only thing we really know is that he wants to see pot legalized on a national scale. Well, bravo. I‚Äôm all for that, even though I‚Äôm not a toker. It‚Äôs a step in the right direction toward dismantling the insane War on Some Drugs. But does he have any other libertarian tendencies? He doesn‚Äôt seem to even have a grasp of the basic principles‚Ä?although he seems better than the average politician. But that‚Äôs not saying much. 
I‚Äôm especially concerned about his running mate, William Weld, who‚Äôs an actual neocon. He‚Äôs an overt statist, an active promoter of warfare, welfare, taxes and regulations. He has no libertarian tendencies at all that I‚Äôm aware of. He‚Äôs a pure Deep State guy. 
One thing you‚Äôve got to say about the Democratic Party is that, while their ideas are destructive and evil, at least they‚Äôre honest about them. Democrats make no bones about being the party of socialism, and they naturally attract the envy-driven, the class warriors, the politically correct, the cultural Marxists, the race baiters, the gender Nazis, and the like. The Democratic Party is beyond redemption. It needs to be flushed. It has zero redeeming value. 
The Republicans attract a different group. Religious people. Cultural traditionalists. People who generally favor what they think is the free market. They tend to be much more nationalistic and pro-military than the Democrats. But, unlike the Dems, the Reps have no real philosophical foundation. They‚Äôre basically just non-Democrats‚Ä?
The Democrats can be viewed as the evil party and the Republicans as the stupid party. But they‚Äôre really just two sides of the same coin, at least when it comes to their leadership‚Äîwho are all Deep State members. 
The Libertarians must now be viewed, at best, as the smart wing of the stupid party. It‚Äôs a sad testimony to the nature of politics‚Ä?
The situation has actually gotten out of control, and the government is so big and so powerful at this point that it can‚Äôt be reversed. Even if Ron Paul were elected, it wouldn‚Äôt do any good. 
The first thing that would happen is that he would be sat down with a bunch of generals and heads of Praetorian agencies, like the FBI, the NSA and the CIA, who would inform him‚Äîpolitely, but firmly‚Äîhow things really work. If he didn‚Äôt play by their rules, his life would be at risk. And if for some reason he dodged those bullets, he would be impeached by Congress before he had the chance to actually change anything. And if for some reason that didn‚Äôt work, the average American would be out in the street rioting, because his doggy dish was going to be broken. Don‚Äôt forget, almost 50% of Americans are net recipients of government benefits. 
I‚Äôm afraid that when the looming crisis blows up, the American people‚Ä?Boobus Americanus as H. L. Mencken said‚Äîis going to clamor for somebody to kiss it all and make it better. We could very well wind up with some type of a military dictatorship. 
Nick Giambruno: I agree, Doug. I also do not vote. And there are far more powerful ways to vote anyway. 
You can vote with your money by swapping fiat currency stored in a fractional reserve banking system (like the US dollar) for physical gold and silver. 
You can also vote with your feet by leaving the country. 
Instead of voting for a politician, which only creates the illusion of making a difference, those two steps can actually make a positive change in your life. 
What‚Äôs your take? 
Doug Casey: I agree. The thing is that all of our ancestors‚Äîall of us who are Americans‚Äîcame from foreign countries. Everybody came to America because they wanted to get away from being turned into slaves in their home countries. The problem is that the US government is going in the same direction as those governments that our ancestors ran away from. Now we have to go someplace else ourselves. We have to find a new America. 
I‚Äôm very pleased that I can watch all this nonsense on a widescreen in a coffee shop in Argentina and not be very adversely affected by it. Argentina, incidentally, is now going the right way from many points of view. 
It‚Äôs dangerous to stay rooted in one place when the natives get restless. Ask Russians in the 20‚Äôs, Germans in the 30‚Äôs, any European in the 40‚Äôs, Chinese in the 50‚Äôs, Cubans in the 60‚Äôs, Vietnamese in the 70‚Äôs, Rhodesians in the 80‚Äôs‚Äîor Venezuelans today. And that‚Äôs just an incomplete list off the top of my head. It‚Äôs especially risky if you have some assets during real economic upset, or ideas that aren‚Äôt mainstream when there‚Äôs real political turbulence. 
Nick Giambruno: Most Americans are effectively stuck in the US. So, looking at these disturbing socio-political trends, what else could happen? 
Doug Casey: It‚Äôs amazing, and disturbing, that most of the young people in the US support Bernie, an avowed socialist, whose ideas are, if anything, worse than Hillary‚Äôs. But it just shows how unhappy young people are with the status quo. Justifiably unhappy. 
Bernie and Trump hit the same nerve‚Äîthey sensed that we‚Äôre on the edge of a revolution in this country. We really are. The situation is not unlike that before the War Between the States, very unstable. 
Both sides are extremely antagonistic. People either hate Trump or they hate Hillary. It doesn‚Äôt matter who wins; the other side is going to be very, very unhappy. And with tensions already running high in the country, and racial, cultural and social clashes in the background, it almost feels like a civil war is in the cards for the US. 
Of course, it seemed like we could have had a civil war back in the late 60‚Äôs and early 70‚Äôs when there were not just a few, but thousands of bombings. Not just little riots, like in Ferguson and Baltimore, but conflagrations like in Watts, DC, and Detroit, where the National Guard was raking the ghetto with .50 cals. 
But the country‚Äôs prosperity was still increasing in those days. Now we‚Äôre on the cusp of The Greater Depression. Things could get ugly. 
Contrary to what most believe, the US hasn‚Äôt had a real civil war yet. The unpleasantness of 1861‚Ä?5 was actually a war of secession. A civil war is one where two or more groups are vying for the control of the same government, as in Spain during the 30‚Äôs, between the fascists and the communists. 
But this time in the US it could turn into a real civil war. I don‚Äôt know what form it would take, but a lot of things could be really tough going: economically, financially, politically, socially, militarily. Most important, there‚Äôs a cultural divide that‚Äôs arisen in the US. 
I don‚Äôt think most people are even aware of what is going on. When you walk outside, the sun is shining. Children are still playing. You can go down to the Wal-Mart and buy cheap goods. Everything looks pretty good on the surface, despite the fact everyone‚Äôs credit card is maxed out. But I think it‚Äôs all a hologram that‚Äôs about to be exposed.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads her Republican rival by three percentage points nationally as they head into the final day of a tight race for the White House, according to a new poll. 
The final Bloomberg Politics-Selzer & Co poll released on Monday has Clinton ahead of Trump, 44 percent to 41 percent. 
Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson was at 4 percent and Green Party candidate Jill Stein had 2 percent support. 
Clinton also leads Trump by three points in a hypothetical two-way matchup when third-party candidates are not included. 
Another tracking poll released early on Monday also put Clinton in the lead. 
The former secretary of state held a four-point lead over the billionaire businessman in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll. The survey showed 47 percent of likely US voters backed Clinton while 43 percent said they supported Trump. 
The Clinton campaign received a late break with FBI Director James Comey announcing Sunday that no criminal charges were forthcoming in the probe of Clinton‚Äôs newly-found emails. 
‚ÄúBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July,‚Ä?the FBI chief wrote in a new letter to congressional committee chairmen. 
The development is a major relief to Clinton, who is spending the final hours of her campaign trying to close Trump‚Äôs path to presidency. Donald Trump walks off the stage after holding a rally at Loudoun Fairgrounds in Leesburg, Virginia, early in the morning on November 7, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Comey sent the presidential race into a frenzy last month when he sent a letter to Congress saying the FBI had discovered emails in a separate probe that could be linked to the investigation into Clinton‚Äôs use of a private server when she was secretary of state. 
The surprise move infuriated Democrats and lifted the presidential hopes of Trump, who has turned the email controversy into a favorite line of attack against Clinton. 
Still, Trump continued to seize on the email issue, insisting that Clinton is ‚Äúguilty.‚Ä?
‚ÄúHillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know,‚Ä?he said Sunday at a rally in Detroit, Michigan. ‚ÄúAnd now it‚Äôs up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8.‚Ä?
Both Clinton and Trump plan to spend the last day of the campaign racing across key battleground states that could determine the results of Tuesday‚Äôs election. 
Trump will visit Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire and finish the day with a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

American hackers recently broke into Russia‚Äôs communications networks, electrical grid and government systems in preparation for a retaliatory cyber strike should Russian hackers meddle in the U.S. election, according to NBC News. 
Officials do not expect any major attacks on U.S. infrastructure, which would be tantamount to an act of war, but they are concerned that Russian hackers may meddle in the election by spreading false information. The hacker ‚ÄúGuccifer 2.0‚Ä?‚Ä?which officials and some cyber security experts believe is a front for Russian intelligence ‚Ä?claimed they would be monitoring elections ‚Äúfrom inside the system.‚Ä?
The U.S. preparations are no different than Russia and China‚Äôs probing of U.S. networks. The penetration caused no damage to Russia, instead it was the equivalent of a military scouting mission. Cyber weapons could be deployed if the U.S. suffered a significant attack, but officials tell NBC News that is an unlikely scenario. Just to be sure though, Obama administration officials issued a back-channel warning to Russia to stay out of the election. 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôd gain access to a network, you‚Äôd establish your presence on the network and then you‚Äôre poised to do what you would like to do with the network,‚Ä?Gary Brown, a former legal adviser to U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), told NBC News. 
U.S. cyber capabilities are top of the line, but the Obama administration has been wary of deploying them, despite consistent Russian provocation. CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency, the agencies responsible for U.S. cyber security, are incredibly secretive regarding U.S. capabilities. Stuxnet is the most well-known, publicized U.S. cyber weapon. The highly advanced computer worm wreaked havoc on Iran‚Äôs nuclear enrichment program in 2010. 
CYBERCOM is currently involved in cyber attacks against the Islamic State, but Pentagon officials have been especially silent on the exact details of the ‚Ä?cyber bombs ‚Ä?being dropped on the terrorist group. Russia may find itself the next target, should it decide to go from misinformation campaigns to attacks on infrastructure.",english,2016-11-08T21:00:37.324+02:00,amtvmedia.com,US,,US Military Prepares To Shut Down Russia‚Äôs Internet If It Hacks The Election,0,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/74f7cc6254e2f30ed8f738bc9279f5e8.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

The dump trucks flank the skyscraper on all sides, and are supplemented by guardrails and heavily armed police officers. This morning, the building was not open to the general public and traffic crawled through a narrow corridor of trucks and police. On the street, supporters and protesters stood for interviews with a burgeoning press corps camped across the street. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump lives in a penthouse near the top of the building, which also serves as headquarters for his presidential campaign.

WikiLeaks just released their newest batch of leaked emails, and they contain messages sent to and from Barack Obama prior to his presidential inauguration.
The most interesting of the emails in this batch involves a message from John Podesta to Obama regarding an invitation from President George W. Bush to then ‚ÄòPresident-Elect‚Ä? It alluded to a transition plan that was being worked on before the election took place.
According to the memo, Obama was already discussing his transition into office with the then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. Here is a statement taken from a memo sent from the transition board to Barack Obama:
As you have observed in your interactions with Secretary Paulson, he is apparently eager to involve you and your transition team extensively in his policy choices following the election.
Immediately after the election Secretary Paulson and other members of the Administration will likely seek to involve you and your transition team in their ongoing policy responses to the financial and housing crises. We also expect relentless interest from the press and public about your intended level of engagement with the Administration on these matters during the transition.
Think about this for a second, Obama‚Äôs transition was already being discussed with certain members of the Bush administration. Also, judging by the email, it‚Äôs clear that it was known that Obama was going to be the president.
Another telling email, dated October 30, 2008, came from John Podesta to the then Senator Obama discussing an economic transition team, and why Obama needed to get the wheels in motion before his term begins.",english,2016-10-27T07:59:43.641+03:00,anonhq.com,US,12993,Wikileaks Releases First Batch Of Barack Obama Emails & They Hint At A Rigged Election,0,http://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/barackobama.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

While the Obama Administration has made much of its intention to start a full-scale cyberwar against Russia at a ‚Äútime of their choosing,‚Ä?the most recent reports suggest that the war is effectively on hold at least until the presidential election in two weeks. 
From President Obama‚Äôs standpoint, the hope is to work with Hillary Clinton, if she becomes president-elect, to launch a cyber war that they both can get behind. Indeed, both have appeared very hawkish against Russia, and Obama apparently doesn‚Äôt want to deny Clinton a chance to participate in the early days of a war she‚Äôd inherit. 
Starting a cyberwar ahead of a Trump win would be even less wise, as Trump has opposed the idea of picking fights with Russia, and expressed strong doubts about Democratic Party ‚Äúcertainty‚Ä?that Russia is behind hacks against them. 
Rep. Adam Schiff (D ‚Ä?CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says that another factor is concern about provoking Russian retaliation for such a US attack before the vote, with many Democrats concerned Russia could release ‚Äúforged‚Ä?documents to embarrass the Clinton campaign. 
Earlier this month, Vice President Joe Biden reported that he has informed Russia of an imminent retaliatory hack, and says the Obama Administration will pick a time which will ‚Äúhave the greatest impact.‚Ä?Russia has denied any involvement in the hacks.

This US has publicly threatened ‚Äòretaliatory‚Ä?hacks against Russia for weeks now, based on allegations that Russia may have been involved in certain hacks related to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Russia denied involvement and the US government has been unable to produce any concrete evidence of Russian involvement. 
Vice President Joe Biden went so far as to confirm the US had informed Vladimir Putin that the US would conduct revenge attacks ‚Äúat the time of our choosing.‚Ä?The time may ultimately be America‚Äôs election day, according to officials familiar with the situation. 
NBC News has reported seeing top secret documents from these officials detailing potential US plans to launch military cyber attacks against Russia‚Äôs civilian infrastructure, with the documents claiming advanced US cyber weapons were prepared to take down Russia‚Äôs entire electricity grid, all telecommunications networks, and the Kremlin‚Äôs own command systems. 
The reports are emerging in the context of US officials speculating that Russia might launch cyber attacks against the US during the election to try to disrupt it. Since they offered no evidence for this either, it raises concerns that the US is simply setting up a pretext for timing its own attacks around them. 
That officials are trying to assure the media that such huge attacks would only be launched in retaliation offers little comfort, given the administration‚Äôs willingness to claim anything and everything remotely election-related and embarrassing to the Clinton campaign as a Russian plot. 
Such massive US attacks on Russian infrastructure, regardless of the pretext, would likely be seen as an act of war. The US has made clear in the past they would regard cyber attacks of a large enough scale as equivalent to conventional military attacks, and given the scale that it being discussed it‚Äôs hard to imagine Russia would not react similarly.
