Democrat Dr. Brenda Snipes was appointed by Jeb Bush in 2003 and is no stranger to controversy. On October 20, the Sun Sentinal reported that former Oakland Park Commissioner Anne Sallee noticed something troubling about her vote-by-mail ballot. It is missing Constitutional Amendment 2, the medical marijuana question. 
Sallee, now Broward chapter director of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, knows her way around government. Yet she said she spent a week unsuccessfully trying to get someone at the Broward elections office to pay attention to her complaint. 
She was cleared on Wednesday of another election snafu, the early posting of primary election results. Her office also was criticized for sending out inaccurate voter ID cards, and for printing ballots for November that include the word no in the yes line on the county's transportation sales surtax question.

In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the ＆never Trumpers' from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten him＃ 
It's easy to glance at Tuesday's popular vote 〞 which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012  and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obama's 2012 totals in several Midwestern states 〞 Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin 〞 Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What's more, she far surpassed Obama's 2012 vote total in Florida, the country's biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. 
A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the country's most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation's most critical battleground states. Let's look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren't yet final because not all precincts have reported.

Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire 
The longer this soap opera drags on, it's becoming more and more evident that the Russian government did not ＆hack' into the DNC, and Moscow is not feeding John Podesta's emails to Wikileaks. For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, this might be a hard pill to swallow. 
The White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that ＆Putin is hacking the US elections.' In response, the President is weighing his options  tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed ＆malicious cyber-activity' tools. 
Even VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying,We're sending a message. We have the capacity to do it. 
It seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US? 
What was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected America's left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton's constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washington's new anti-Russia movement. 
On July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote, The Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton's private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans. 
Anyone who was paying attention back then knew this ＆Russian hack' talking point was purely political, but then again, who's really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media. 
You can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party's hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trump's GOP primary success. From that point on, Trump's political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words, ＆comparing one dictator to another.' 
Never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance . If you've made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own party's nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin? said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami. 
Backed by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia  not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona  a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The media's coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled,  Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system , we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: 
Hackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state. 
But then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: 
The bureau described the threat as credible and significant, an eight on a scale of one to 10, Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the state's voter registration system for nearly a week. 
And then, down to almost nothing＃ 
It turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County. 
At no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like, Cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack. 
Are American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French: ＆bottom of the bag') where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories  in the middle a national election cycle? It's a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election. 
Behind Clinton's wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House＃ 
On October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta  giving them to Wikileaks. 
Soon, there was a queue of ＆national security' politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out, Russia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putin's calculus with a strong diplomatic, political, -cyber and economic response. 
According to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima , the only ＆evidence' that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged ＆Russian government hacks' provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike . No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrike's word for it. 
IMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security. 
The Post's Nakashima then added: 
The administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers. 
An online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts, the joint statement said. ＃ We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russias senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. 
Moscows press secretarys reply: This is some sort of nonsense, said Dmitry Peskov. 
Despite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNNs Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really confirmed that Russia was behind the email hacks  and still no evidence , other than speculative guesswork, has been presented. 
Likewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that Russia did it, thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesnt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona  are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a ＆ parallel universe . 
Still, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how  17 US intelligence agencies  aka the Intelligence Community all agreed that Russia did it. 
The announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. 
We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election, said Clinton. I find that deeply disturbing. 
Whats even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clintons 17 agencies: 
Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. 
What does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podestas emails? Answer: nothing. 
The exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016 . The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda. 
In both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washingtons flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and journalists working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN  none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Partys decree that Russian is hacking the US election process. If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement: ＃ [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow 〞 the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russias senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney , when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are ＆hacking US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a  disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker.  
Under partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid , the FBI also initiated another investigation into people linked to the Trump team with Russia. Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI havent come up with anything. 
To be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack  because her staff read it to her from the campaigns daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US governments much vaunted Intelligence Community . Of course, thats the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddams nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraqs imaginary Winnebagos of Death aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks. 
For those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as ＆Washington Intelligence, I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now, No, that was Iraq, that was Bush. Were not like that. No, this time its different. This time we are sure the Russians did it! 
In 2014, Obama claimed that Kims notorious Bureau 121 hacked into Sony Pictures. 
This isnt the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign ＆hack and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washingtons conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called ＆ Bureau 121 . Just like with todays Russian Hack theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White Houses ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the ＆Russian Hack claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike . 
Jumping the Shark 
After their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative. 
Soon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to destabilize and dominate the West. Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of ＆interfering with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back. The biggest impact of @wikileaks ? Shining a spotlight on Russias attempt to undermine American democracy and Trumps refusal to condemn it https://t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5 
〞 Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016 
Clinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only ＆evidence seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as ＆proof that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaigns desperate claims. It was embarrassing. 
They could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead. 
Either way, the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger . The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video  their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization. 
Their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz . They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened. 
To prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful, said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race. I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this years historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership, said Clinton. 
The party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it. 
Party Meltdown 
Wasserman Schultzs replacement didnt fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches  showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives  straight to Hillary Clinton. 
 A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNNs Jake Tapper. 
 A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich. (Source: Daily Caller ) 
Braziles audacious fraud also helped contribute to her partys planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: 
. Completely corrupt and still, Brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on FOX News last week. Braziles reputation is so bad now that even CNN has severed ties with her  and thats saying a lot. 
In addition, it was also revealed how CNNs head political commentator, Gloria Borger , was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of ＆journalists the Clinton campaign would work with to gain favorable coverage. Youd think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNNs election coverage. 
Clearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Ever-unbiased CNN's Gloria Borger refers to being in ""GOP hell"" and says she'll ""reach out soon"" to Podesta. Heart-warming #PodestaEmails13 pic.twitter.com/CQFdcJ12Q5

Worse Than Watergate 
Perhaps a bigger scandal which the Obama White House and Clinton campaign operatives would like to bury  is the FBIs investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue: 
Some investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isnt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president. 
Theres more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe , received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe  a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times . 
So why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia , and cover-up the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps? One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top  to the President himself. 
What 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillarys unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clintons server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports. The Presidents lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that: 
Obama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clintons private email server. 
So, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails off grid with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server  maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it. 
Sure, hes not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club  caught out lying to the American people. 
On top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as  born classified . The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. 
COVER-UP: John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet (Image: ABC News ) 
It should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action  that the Obama Justice Department (DOJ) is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case. 
On Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case  currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin) who was snared in a ＆sexting scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation? None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik . Who is Kadzik? Zero Hedge reports: 
Oh yes. Recall our post from last week,  Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillarys Benghazi Hearing  in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clintons Benghazi testimony? It was Peter Kadzik. 
Oh, and if that wasnt good enough, Kadzik was also Podestas lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as ＆best friends. FOX News confirms: 
Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail, Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podestas Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. 
To call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it. 
Russia  The Party Scapegoat 
Former Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting: Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. 
〞 Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) October 29, 2016 
Another veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville , was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused the KGB working with Republicans to hijack the election during his wild rant on MSNBC . 
I think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. Thats what I think, said Carville. 
Maybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB , and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991. 
These are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many exposs revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence  unlike the ＆Russians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks. 
Suffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that ＆Putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US. Theyve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-Russian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep  a perfect double entendre . 
The geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washingtons State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry , Samantha Power , and John Kirby , already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown  that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of US-backed ＆rebels Al Nusra Front, or Nour al-Din al-Zenki. 
With so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about? 
The demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup detat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that its been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks  and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing Americas own state-run media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said , We are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram, He was forced to resign shortly after that. 
Whats clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although ＆ Russian-backed Rebles Shootting Down MH17 , and ＆ Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013 ＆ certainly comes to mind. 
That said, its hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of ＆Hacking Into the US Electoral Process. When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders . Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washingtons claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 Election 
On Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table: 
We have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. Its not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security. 
Self-serving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the Obama-Clinton era. 
Knowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere  if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry. 
Still, were waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington  before its too late.

Here is an article that looks at the real story behind one of the more interesting conspiracy theories about the 2016 election: 
Sometimes the real story is even more fascinating than any conspiracy theory. WeAreYourGods 
Wanna bet money that the Weiner laptop, on which the over 600,000 emails were stored in a folder titled Life Insurance, holds information linking the CF to human trafficking and typical elite pedophilia vacations? Ever wonder why nobody ever really goes after the Clinton Foundation from a government office? Same old blackmail scheme involving underage sex slaves that was going on during the Boys Town scandal with Lawrence King and elite politicians and business people in the 80s. Why would they stop? Brad Dueringer 
It seems the most morally depraved beings are the ones we let run things. But they have help crafting reality with the tribe that owns the media Analyze_This_88 
Barrak Obama and Hillary Clinton are both political scam artists. Its amazing that a US President would invent a Russian Hacking conspiracy theory in order to drive a geopolitical agenda. But then again, Bush did the same with Bin Laden and 9/11. 
Clinton on the other hand is pure corruption personified. Shes should never be allowed near public office.

(AP Photo / Dennis System) 
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) 〞 Following the results of Tuesday nights election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19 th . Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. 
People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers, Obama told reporters. Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump. 
Under the Presidents order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. 
Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the presidents decision. 
Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didnt allow that to happen. President Obama doesnt care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right. 
The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. 
We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary. 
Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. 
Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes , but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19 th . What the people are actually voting for are their states electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them. 
Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the Presidents Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. 
[The electoral college] is a f〞king joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise . Everyone should have an equal vote, and thats just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. Its time to bring our system into the 21 st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare. 
Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. 
Were going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this, Obama said. Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasnt this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this? Obama said. If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered. 
If you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19 th election , you can call the Obama administrations special election hotline at (785) 273-0325.

Smoking Gun In Massive Election Fraud Discovered By Investigators    
Black Box Voting, founded in 2003, performs nonpartisan investigative reporting on elections in an attempt to stop vote rigging. 

You may be wondering what the term ""black box"" means. A ""black box"" system is non-transparent; its functions are hidden from the public. Elections, of course, should not be black box systems. 

Here is a link to a free copy of the book, Black Box Voting HERE. 

Author Bev Harris became known for groundbreaking work on electronic voting machines, which can remove transparency of the vote count.

In September 1980, as violence and civil war erupted throughout Central America, a quiet American left Harvard Law School to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries in northern Honduras. Around him, the United States-backed military dictatorship hunted Marxists and cracked down on the Catholic clergy for preaching empowerment to peasant farmers. But some locals also looked warily on the bearded and mop-haired Midwesterner in their midst. Just a few hours south, the Central Intelligence Agency was using Honduras as a staging ground in its covert war against Latin American communism, with right-wing forces training for operations in El Salvador and Nicaragua. Some of the people were wondering whats going on, who is this guy? Tim Kaine, then a 22-year-old volunteer and now the Democratic nominee for vice president, said in an interview. He understood why. His mentors in the priesthood had also urged him to be wary of friendly American faces. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was a time of such intrigue and suspicion, Mr. Kaine said. Far from being a C.I.A. operative, Mr. Kaine was a young Catholic at a crossroads, undergoing a spiritual shift as he awakened to the plight of the deeply poor in Honduras. In its far-flung pueblos, banana plantation company towns and dusty cities, Mr. Kaine embraced an interpretation of the gospel, known as liberation theology, that championed social change to improve the lives of the downtrodden. In Honduras, his recitation of the traditional Catholic mealtime blessing changed to Lord give bread to those who hunger, and hunger for justice to those who have bread. Honduran military leaders, American officials and even Pope John Paul II viewed liberation theology suspiciously, as dangerously injecting Marxist beliefs into religious teaching. But the strong social-justice message of liberation theology helped set Mr. Kaine on a left-veering career path in which he fought as a lawyer against housing discrimination, became a liberal mayor, and rose as a Spanish-speaking governor and senator with an enduring focus on Latin America.",english,2016-10-28T01:39:13.503+03:00,abovetopsecret.com,US,18533,"What is one more election thread, ehhh?",0,http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/ats17.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Over the course of this years US presidential election, which has been nothing if not bizarre, some have repeatedly speculated that the election may not actually happen at all if an opportunely timed terrorist attack or other major event occurred at just the right moment, leading to a suspension of the November election. Now, these theories appear to have more credence as sources within US intelligence have contacted Pat Milton, a CBS News senior investigative producer, warning him that terrorist attacks in three US states are highly likely come this Monday, the day before the US election. US Intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al Qaeda, not ISIS, could be planning attacks in New York, Texas, and Virginia. No specific locations within those three states were mentioned. 
US authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously, though CBS News  sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed. According to CBS , counter-terrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an abundance of caution. 
Earlier this week, there were also warnings that polling places could be seen as attractive targets for lone wolf attackers by individuals motivated by violent extremist ideologies, sovereign citizen or other extremist activity. This has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worst-case scenarios. One FBI official told CBS : 
The counter-terrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States. The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety. 
However, whats interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al Qaeda as opposed to the Islamic State. In the Syrian civil war, the US has been actively helping al Qaeda there, grouping their Syrian branch  the al Nusra Front  in with the moderate rebels they support. Therefore, al Qaedas ability to launch attacks within the US has been directly aided by US intelligence, making this announcement incredibly suspect. 
Its also worth pointing out that al Qaeda, since its inception, has been a product of the US intelligence community. In the 1980s they were essentially created by the US to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. Ever since, they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of US wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically. 
It is also interesting that the threat is al Qaeda and NOT the Islamic State. The Islamic State has been the terrorist bogeyman of recent years and their involvement in any threat, real or imagined, is useful justification for escalating US involvement in Syria. It seems highly likely that the Islamic State was left out due to recent revelations from WikiLeaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the Clinton Foundation. 
It is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass, it will be a big help for Hillary. Hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to WikiLeaks near constant releases of her campaign chairs emails, but also due to the FBIs mutiny which led them to re-open a probe into Clintons use of a private email server. Any terror attack would give Clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in Syria and the rest of the Middle East. 
However, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, it is also possible that a terrorist attack on US soil would give President Obama the authority to either postpone or outright cancel the election, something he could not normally do except in the event of extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, only time will tell which theory is correct, compelling us to stay vigilant in the meantime.

By Joseph Jankowski 
An organization which has the aim to separate the state of California from the Union of the United States is set to hold a meeting at the state capitol in Sacramento on Wednesday, November 9, 2016, the day after the presidential election. 
The Yes California Independence Campaign , which is based in San Diego, describes itself as a nonviolent campaign to establish the country of California using any and all legal and constitutional means to do so. 
The group is currently trying to qualify a citizens initiative in 2018 to get a referendum for secession on the ballot in 2019, reports SF Gate . They will be in Sacramento in hopes to gather support for the states exit, or the Calexit, as they call it. 
In our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children, reads Yes California s official website. 
The groups page reads on: 
Although charity is part of our culture, when you consider that Californias infrastructure is falling apart, our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country, we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities, poverty rates remain high, income inequality continues to expand, and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today, now is not the time for charity. However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to self-determination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law.
It is about California taking its place in the world, standing as an equal among nations. We believe in two fundamental truths: (1) California exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world, and (2) California could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a U.S. state. 
Yes California s website lays out 9 different points covering topics the group believes will benefit from a California exit from the US, including education, peace and security, debt and taxes and immigration. 
One blog post on their page draws parallels with a Calexit and the recent referendum known as Brexit that passed in the UK in June which showed that most British people are ready for their country to leave the EU. 
The push for secession is nothing new to California. In 1941 the mayor of Port Orford, Oregon, Gilbert Gable, proposed the idea to push the Oregon counties of Curry, Josephine, Jackson, and Klamath to join with the California counties of Del Norte, Siskiyou, and Modoc to form a new state, later named Jefferson. 
Modoc County of Northern California voted in 2013 to join neighboring Siskiyou County in a push to secede from the State of California . 
In 2014, two counties in northern California petitioned for the right to form a 51st State of America, which they also wanted to name Jefferson.

Donald Trumps deplorable supporters arent waiting for the election results to start spilling blood. 
Theyve been threatening bloody violence ever since Trump began claiming that the election is rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton. And Trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places. 
In Texas last week, a Trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of Trumps stupid hats and a Deplorables T-shirt to vote. 
Election code prohibits any person from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. 
Of course, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules dont apply to them. 
Well, now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped Trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down. 
At Collin College in Plano, Texas a Trump sign was discovered zip-tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places. 
But when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside. The blades sliced into the volunteers hands and drew blood, requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal. 
It just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody whos probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other, local Democratic Party campaign chair Steve Spainhouer said in response . I think most people have already made their minds up at this point how theyre going to vote and so theres nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful. 
Heres the video via KTVT . 
Frankly, this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism. Trumps supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as Election Day approaches. And if Trump loses, his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup. 
Clearly, these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger. But you wont hear Donald Trump condemning this act of violence. After all, he is the one inciting it.

Saturday Night Live has helped bring quite a bit of levity to this otherwise horrific election year but in the final episode before the election, before we as a nation go to the polls and decide if we want to be extraordinary or deplorable, the cast of Saturday Night Live could not help but drop the act and get real with America. 
It began as it normally does, with Alec Baldwins masterful Donald Trump character and Kate McKinnons excellent portrayal of Hillary Clinton (if she spent all day every day mainlining a dangerous mixture of sugar and caffeine). 
I never use emails, Trump says in the cold opener. I use a very private, very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it Its called Twitter. 
After he is informed that everyone can see his tweets, Trump replies: 
Really? And Im still in this thing? America you must really hate this lady. 
After a scathing rebuke of the medias decision to ignore Trumps cozy relationship with Putin, the KKK, and the FBI and instead focus on something as meaningless as Hillary Clintons emails, something magical happened: McKinnon and Baldwin dropped the facade and got serious. 
Im sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this, Baldwin says. I just feel gross all the time about this. Dont you all feel gross? he added, addressing the audience. 
McKinnon agrees and the two embark on a friendship montage through the city before returning to the stage. Then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year. None of this would have mattered if you dont vote, Baldwin says. 
We cant tell you who to vote for, but on Tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in, McKinnon finishes.

In reaction to Donald Trumps victory, The Simpsons decided to update their 2000 prediction of a Trump presidency. 
In 2000, the show showed a glimpse into the future where President Lisa Simpson inherited an economic mess from President Trump. Well, now that fictional story line has become a horrifying reality.

Hopefully, the financial despair the fictional President Trump never becomes a reality, but seeing as he has no experience, is a businessman whos not as good as he says he is, and The Simpsons have been right thus far, the futures looking pretty bleak. 
Heres the original clip of President Lisa Simpson calling out a Donald Trump presidency for his fiscal fallout and bad economy: 
Early on into Trumps campaign, The Simpsons satirized the reality TV host turned president-elect by having Homer Simpson somehow at the campaign rollout and falling into Trumps hair. If we could only go back to that moment and enjoy the comedy over reality. 
Now we have to reap what weve sown, or rather what the less than half of voting Americans have sown considering Trump only won with the Electoral College and lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in his own words, big league. 
Most of us with The Simpsons were very wrong with the prediction as well.

By Susan Duclos - All News PipeLine Progressive liberals, George Soros and his merry band of paid protesters, and the mainstream media are certainly giving new meaning to William Shakespeare's "" Fight to the last gasp ,"" quote, but what none of them seem to realize yet as they cry, scream, riot and offer their mea culpa's is that the fight is over, the election is finished, their opponents have gone home to celebrate and they are doing nothing but flailing in the wind while grunting incoherently.While anyone can see the headlines about the third day of protests and riots, and how those that are incapable of understanding quite how elections work and are holding out for a pipe-dream that maybe they can make electors of the electoral college change their vote, what many are missing is how the mainstream media is attempting to suck more air out oxygen tanks that have gone empty.... and they have no one to blame but themselves. THE ULTIMATE LOSERS IN THE 2016 ELECTION - THE MSM For the last year and a half we have witnessed and reported on the mainstream media's unrelenting and unapologetic campaign against Donald Trump, where 91 percent of the reporting since the party's convention, where he was named the GOP nominee, has been studied and found to have been negative, but even before that they treated Trump as if he didn't stand a chance to win that nomination.We have noted and reported via Wikileaks releases how that very same MSM had colluded with the DNC and the Clinton campaign in order to influence the public to elect Hillary Clinton.We have also observed and reported how Trump supporters were constantly labeled and portrayed as racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, uneducated, uninformed, white nationalist deplorables, just to name a few of the colorful descriptors.How did that work out for them?Despite their biased reporting and throwing everything, including the kitchen sink, at Trump, we now have President-Elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, to be sworn in on January 20, 2017. While Hillary Clinton will fade into obscurity and the protesters will eventually go home just to criticize everything Trump does for the next four (maybe 8?) years, and progressives will get over their sworn ""revolution"" within the party between liberals and moderate Democrats, the ultimate losers are not Clinton supporters, celebrities that swore to leave the country if Trump won, nor Democrats as a party.... it is the mainstream media that was rendered irrelevant, crushed by a wave of ""deplorables"" and alternative media bypassing their once-influential status to communicate without their fasle prism of 'truth.' MSM'S LAST GASP Now they are offering their mea culpas, dedicating countless hours and ink to explaining and justifying how they were so wrong in their predictions that they knew ahead of time were based on a false premise, and taking their ""last gasp"" by swearing to ""rededicate"" themselves to reporting honestly, while at the same time claiming they reported on ""both candidates fairly.""I kid you not.Below is a letter by Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. and Dean Baquet, the publisher and editor of the New York Times:First point is that if they had been reporting ""fairly"" as claimed in the letter above, they would not need to ""rededicate"" themselves to honesty. Secondly, they did not strive ""to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences,"" of Trump supporters, rather they maligned, criticized, belittled and mocked anybody that did not agree with their superior and smug political opinion.While it is to be expected that Trump supporters, verbally abused on a regular basis will not forget nor forgive media outlets such as the Times, the Public Editor Liz Spayd, who works independently, with the job of examining The Times with an eye to protecting journalistic integrity and good practices, describes the reaction from other members of the public to their reporting. Readers are sending letters of complaint at a rapid rate. Here?s one that summed up the feelings succinctly, from Kathleen Casey of Houston: ""Now, that the world has been upended and you are all, to a person, in a state of surprise and shock, you may want to consider whether you should change your focus from telling the reader what and how to think, and instead devote yourselves to finding out what the reader (and nonreaders) actually think."" Another letter, from Nick Crawford of Plymouth, Mich., made a similar point. ""Perhaps the election result would not be such a surprise if your reporting had acknowledged what ordinary Americans care about, rather than pushing the limited agenda of your editors,"" he wrote. ""Please come down from your New York City skyscraper and join the rest of us."" What Ms. Spayd does not acknowledge is that their reporting will not and cannot change as long as their publisher and editor, the ones that wrote the letter in the image above, continue to insist their reporting during the campaign season was in any way fair, or to even pretend they attempted to ""understand and reflect all political perspectives."" What Ms. Spayd also does not address is the fact that five different New York Times' reporters accepted the invitations for the off-the-record gatherings to ""frame the HRC message"" with the Clinton campaign staff before her campaign launched, including, Gail Collins, Jonathan Martin, Maggie Haberman, Patrick Healy, and Amy Chozick, all of which consistently penned hit pieces against Trump.It is heartening to see that outlets like the New York Times are being called to the carpet by their own readers, as well as admitting they are losing subscribers, because while Trump supporters were maligned and lied about, their readers were misinformed and lied to . The country?s major news organizations, as surprised as anybody by Donald J. Trump?s ascension to the presidency, faced a question from their audiences on Wednesday that was laced with a sense of betrayal and anger: How did you get it so wrong? The question came in letters. (""To editors and writers of The NYT,"" one reader wrote, ""you were so wrong for so long. You misled your readers and were blinded by your own journalistic bigotry."") It came in Facebook posts. (""You were in a bubble and weren?t paying attention to your fellow Americans,"" the filmmaker Michael Moore wrote in a post shared more than 100,000 times.) Most ominously, it came in the form of canceled subscriptions, something that will surely be monitored. Former Times' reporter Michael Goodwin offers the Times some free advice : Using an outside law firm or even in-house reporters, he must assess how and why Baquet made the decision to sever the paper from its roots. He must assess the impact on reporters and editors, and whether they felt pressure to conform their stories to Baquet?s political bias. Whatever the findings, the publisher must insist that the standards of fairness again become a fundamental tenet in the news room. As an added guarantee, he must insist that the paper enlarge its thinking about diversity to include journalists who disagree with the Times embedded liberal slant. There has to be a difference of perspective to judge where fairness lies. Readers, and former readers, should be part of the process. Many already know that the paper must get its head out of parochial New York and into the hearts and minds of Americans everywhere. This is about survival. If it doesn?t change now, the Gray Lady?s days surely are numbered. BOTTOM LINE Frankly I believe traditional media's days are numbered whatever they do, and they are on their last gasp. There are too many Independent journalists and alternative news sites from both sides of the political aisle that are rendering them irrelevant. While alternative media has its own set of biases, the majority always provide links, documents when available, video clips and other methods for readers to verify, research and come to their own conclusions, something mainstream media doesn't want readers to do because they feel they have the right to lead the public where the MSM wants them to go, rather than inform the public and trust them to make their own determinations.",english,2016-11-13T19:46:48.693+02:00,allnewspipeline.com,US,78393,"Readers Enraged By MSM Election Reporting - 'You Misled Your Readers, Blinded By Journalistic Bigotry'",0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

They have just illegally crossed into the U.S. and have been released by border patrol, with ankle monitors, while they file for asylum.

Were getting mass spikes of people crossing and turning themselves in, said Agent Chris Cabrera, who is with the local border patrol union. 
Cabrera said on some days, theyve encountered up to a thousand immigrants along this stretch of the border. He said the election is partly to blame for the surge. 
The smugglers are telling them if Hillary gets elected, that therell be some sort of amnesty, that they need to get here by a certain date. Theyre also being told that if Trump gets elected, theres going to be some magical wall that pops up overnight and once that wall gets up, nobody will ever get in again, Cabrera said.

Rigged elections. Vigilante observers. Angry voters. The claims, threats and passions surrounding the presidential race have led communities around the U.S. to move polling places out of schools or cancel classes on Election Day. 
The fear is that the ugly rhetoric of the campaign could escalate into confrontations and even violence in school hallways, endangering students. 
If anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election, then they arent paying much attention, said Ed Tolan, police chief in Falmouth, Maine, which decided to call off classes on Election Day and put additional officers on duty Nov. 8. 
{snip} 
Schools are popular polling places because they have plenty of parking and are usually centrally located. Its difficult to say how many school-based polling places have been moved this year, given how decentralized the voting process is across the country. 
But state and local officials say voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. 
There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering, that we didnt have 15 or 20 years ago. What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. If that happens at a school, then thats certainly concerning. 
{snip} 
Easton Superintendent John Reinhart wanted to get voting out of schools altogether but was rebuffed by county election officials. So the school board canceled classes on Election Day. 
If you take the personalities away and cast the emotion with the election aside, one has to ask the question: ＆Are our schools the best places for that activity to take place?' he said. I just think weve reached the point where we need to look at other locations.

A record number of illegal aliens have crossed the U.S.- Mexico border and are in U.S. Border Patrol custody in Texas Rio Grande Valley Sector (RGV), according to the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC). Border Patrol Agent and NBPC President Brandon Judd spoke exclusively with Breitbart Texas and condemned the leadership of the Border Patrols parent agency, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), for allegedly keeping this information secret ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
We are at breaking point. We have the highest number of illegal aliens in custody in history in Border Patrols RGV Sector and this information has been kept from the American public, said Agent Judd. The talk of amnesty has once again created pull factors and encouraged people from all over the world to cross Mexico and then cross our porous southern border to illegally enter the U.S. We are simply overwhelmed. {snip} 
Agent Judd told Breitbart Texas that Americans should vote their conscience, but they should do so with all of the information available. This is an issue of the federal government restricting crucial information from the public ahead of a presidential election and it is unacceptable. Americans deserve to know the truth. Our Border Patrol agents deserve for Americans to know what they are really facing. Too many Border Patrol agents have given their lives and left loved ones to grieve for CBP leadership to play these types of political games ahead of such an impactful election. 
{snip} 
Historically, CBP, Border Patrols parent agency, has had to correct false assertions and denials. Perhaps the most glaring example occurred in June 2014 when an official CBP Twitter account directly accused this reporter of publishing a false report, only to later admit the report was accurate and true . 
{snip} 
UPDATE: Breitbart Texas received this response from CBP: 
First, the number in custody in RGV is less than half what is was in June 2014. 
Also, I would refer you to Secretary Johnsons statement about southwest border security issued October 17. In it, the Secretary addresses the specific issue of unaccompanied children and family units. The statement includes statistics for the full year of fiscal year 2016.

Profound rifts among groups lie beneath the close presidential contest, underscoring the countrys fundamental political divisions not only by gender, education, race and ethnicity but also by factors ranging from religious belief to residential area. 
{snip} 
Theres a 22 point gender gap in the contest, nearly double the norm in elections since 1976. And that pales compared with other gaps44 points between college- and non-college-educated whites, 65 points between whites and nonwhites, 66 points between rural and urban residents and 97 points between white evangelicals and likely voters who dont profess a particular religion. 
{snip} 
Trump is doing less well with Republicans and GOP leaners who wanted someone else to win the nomination; he has 75 percent support in this group, with 15 percent going to Clinton, 7 percent to Johnson or Stein. Two factors mitigate the damage: leaning Republicans have grown more apt to say they supported Trump in the first place (47 percent, up from 40 percent in August), and theres no slippage evident in turnout among leaning Republicans who preferred someone else for the nomination. 
{snip} 
Differences among groups abound, with one of the largest between evangelical white Protestantsa core Republican constituencyand those who profess no religion. The former back Trump by 77 to 19 percent; the latter, Clinton by 64 to 25 percent. The groups are identical in size, each making up 17 percent of likely voters. The gap between them is typical.

The racial gap, while wide, is narrower than typical. Whites support Trump by 53 to 39 percent; nonwhites favor Clinton, 72 to 21 percent. But that 65 point divide is a bit smaller than the average in exit polls since 1976, 73 points, as well as 26 points smaller than the record racial gap, 91 points, in 1984. Thats mostly because of lower support for Clinton among nonwhites who are not black or Hispanic; 48 percent back her, versus 66 percent for Barack Obama in 2012. 
In a particularly prominent result in this election, gender and education continue to spell broad differences among whites. College-educated white women, consistently strong for Clinton all year, now back her by 59 to 32 percent. Non-college-educated white men, steadily one of Trumps best groups, support him 64 to 26 percent. 
White men with a college degree continue to divide closely, making them a battleground group. Non-college-educated white womenthe largest of these groups, at 24 percent of likely votershave wavered in their support, generally for Trump but by varying margins. Lately, they look more settled on Trump, now by 61 to 33 percent.

Americans arent the only ones motivated by Tuesdays election. The presidential race has immigrants from around the world racing to the U.S.-Mexican border, as the cartels exploit a powerful narrative: get into the U.S. while you still can. 
Smugglers are telling them that they need to come across now while theres a chance, said Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in Tucson, Ariz., whose views were echoed by another agent in Texas. 
People think if one candidate wins, certain things will happen, like a giant wall being built and then they can never get through, said Chris Cabrera, an agent in the Rio Grande Valley. Another faction believes that if the other candidate wins, theyll get amnesty if theyre here by a certain date. 
Those two competing narrativestriggered by the rhetoric of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, respectivelyare driving immigration numbers the Border Patrol hasnt seen in years in some sectors. 
We are overwhelmed, said a veteran agent in McAllen, Texas. We are seeing 800 to 1,000 apprehensions every night. 
In fiscal 2016, the Border Patrol apprehended 117,200 immigrants from Central America, almost one-third of all apprehensions border-wideand 5,000 more than during the so-called surge of 2014. The agency also apprehended 5,000 Haitians, up from just 700 last year. The number of immigrants claiming to be from Africa and Asia also is up. 
{snip} 
The poverty and violence plaguing many of these countries helps push immigrants north, Beeson said. Pull factors include available and good-paying jobs in the U.S. and immigration policy that provides work permits and freedom for immigrants while the courts adjudicate their ＆asylum claim. 
When you stop somebody, you ask their name and the first thing they tell you is＆Im here for asylum, I cant go home because theyll kill me. . . . When it takes a good five or six minutes just to get their name out of them, they have a rehearsed story, said Cabrera. Once they get those papers saying they can pass through our checkpoint, well never see them again. 
Del Cueto said the agents are not getting any backing from D.C. and we need to start enforcing every single immigration law we have on the books. 
Del Cueto and Cabrera belong to the National Border Patrol Council, which represents the Border Patrols 18,000 field agents who are prohibited from talking openly to the media.",english,2016-11-05T05:30:03.395+02:00,amren.com,US,94243,Illegal Immigrants Surging to US-Mexico Border in Race Against Election Day,0,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Thats according to an unusual survey on the impact of minorities, mostly Latin American, done for WalletHub and provided to Secrets .

TRUTH REVOLT 
Theres a lot of accusations going around that the 2016 election is rigged. From Democrats suggesting Russia is tampering with the presidential election to a plethora of documents and undercover video that proves Democrats are trying their darnedest to sway the outcome. 
President Obama has laughed off the notion that Bernie Sanders was forced out by the DNC and believes Donald Trump is out of his mind for suggesting elections are rigged. And of course, Obama would never admit that Hillary Clinton could do something wrong. But candidate Obama, in 2008, sure was concerned that the election might be rigged against him. 
Video of him answering a campaign question has surfaced to put to rest the notion that he doesnt believe in the possibility: 
Well, I tell you what: it helps in Ohio that weve got Democrats in charge of the machines. [Cheering] But look, I come from Chicago, so I want to be honest, its not as if its just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past, sometimes Democrats have too.

REUTERS 
Down a Georgia country road, camouflaged members of the Three Percent Security Force have mobilized for rifle practice, hand-to-hand combat training 〞 and an impromptu campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. 
How many people are voting for Trump? Ooh-rah! asks Chris Hill, a paralegal who goes by the code name Bloodagent. 
Ooh-rah! shout a dozen militia members in response, as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend. 
As the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton. 
They say they wont fire the first shot, but theyre not planning to leave their guns at home, either. 
Trumps populist campaign has energized militia members like Hill, who admire the Republican moguls promise to deport illegal immigrants, stop Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexico border. Trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be rigged, and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win. At least one paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud. 
Armed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early 1990s, fueled by confrontations in Ruby Ridge, Idaho and Waco, Texas, culminating in a militia sympathizers 1995 bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people. 
Their numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years, driven by fears that President Barack Obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, estimates there were 276 active militias last year, up from 42 in 2008. 
In recent years, armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of land-use disputes in the western United States. Federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon. 
Many fear Clinton would push the county further to the left. 
This is the last chance to save America from ruin, Hill said. Im surprised I was able to survive or suffer through eight years of Obama without literally going insane, but Hillary is going to be more of the same. 

EXTREMIST GROUPS EMBOLDENED 
The Oath Keepers, a prominent anti-government force that sent gun-toting members to the 2014 race riots in Ferguson, Missouri, called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud. 
An hour south of Atlanta, the Three Percent Security Force started the day around the campfire, taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range. They whooped with approval when blasts from one members high-powered rifle knocked down a tree. 
The group operates independently, but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government. The movement draws its name from the notion that no more than 3 percent of the American population fought in the Revolutionary War against Britain. 
Amid the war games, Hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on Washington if Clinton wins. 
He said he doesnt want his members leading the way, but they will defend the protesters if need be. His group will not hesitate to act if a President Clinton tries to disarm gun owners, he said. 
I will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen, and prevent them from being disarmed, and I will fight and I will kill and I may die in the process, said Hill, who founded the militia several years ago. 
Trumps candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law, said Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
Prior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape, he said. Now these ideas are legitimized. 
Over the past week, some prominent Trump supporters have hinted at violence. 
If Trump loses, Im grabbing my musket, former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh wrote on Twitter last week. Conservative commentator Wayne Root fantasized about Clintons death while speaking at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Sunday. 
Back in Georgia, the Three Percent Security Force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun. They then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides, ready for whatever may come. 
Weve building up for this, just like the Marines, he said. We are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come.

LEW ROCKWELL 
( Source: The 2nd American Civil War by Richard Hubal, via MN Artists ) 
Nick Giambruno: The US presidential election is only days away. What are the countrys greatest problems right now? 
Doug Casey: Domestically, Id say the continual and accelerating loss of freedom, compounded by the prospect of what I suspect will be the biggest financial/economic crisis of modern times. What might that crisis be like? Thats unpredictable, although the odds are it will be unlike any others that are still fresh in peoples memories, simply because people tend to be most prepared for the things that have most recently scared them. The big problems usually come from an unexpected quarter, and/or at an unexpected time. Like the monetary crisis of 1998, that materialized in Thailand. 
That said, the question remains of where to look. It could come from outside American borders, in the form of war. War is perhaps the worst thing that can happen, not only for the destruction it will cause in itself, but because it will immensely exacerbate Americas domestic problems. As Bourne famously said, War is the health of the State. Certainly, the US government is actively provoking other governments in a score of places around the world. The next war could be serious, not just a sports war, like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Nick Giambruno: In 2000, the federal governments debt was just over $5 trillion. Now, its about $20 trillion. It doesnt matter whos in power. The debt continues to grow exponentially. Unless the government makes radical cuts to welfare and the military〞which wont happen no matter who is elected〞it will grow indefinitely. 
If Americans are destined to be indebted serfs no matter whos in power, do the elections even matter? 
Doug Casey: If the economy goes off of the deep end over the next year〞and I think it will〞the US government is going to be running much bigger deficits. Spending is going to go up for welfare. Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security〞thats already about two-thirds of the US governments budget. Military spending is also going up. All that is going to go up, regardless of who wins the election on November 8. 
We could easily see a trillion dollar deficit, perhaps much more. Now, where are they going to get all that money? The Chinese arent going to lend it to the US anymore. Theyre basically going to finance the deficit by selling the debt to the Federal Reserve. And that means creating more currency units out of thin air. 
But, on the other hand, the average guy〞and for that matter, most businesses〞arent borrowing money now. Theyre too afraid. They dont want to be in debt. The question is: As this comes to a real climax, are we going to have something resembling a runaway inflation in the dollar? Or are we going to have a massive credit collapse, which could be caused by defaults on bonds, house mortgages, student loans, or auto loans? Im not sure which is going to happen. I mean, you buy a car now in the US, it costs you what a house did a couple generations ago. It all floats on a sea of debt. Im just betting on financial chaos. That is the safe bet. 
No matter which way this election goes, its going to be ugly. 
Both candidates, Trump and Clinton, are disastrous. To me, its a sign of how degraded the US has become. About a year ago, they gave us a choice between Hillary, the wife of a previous president, pretty much playing the role of Argentinas Evita, Juan Perons brassy wife. And Jeb Bush, the brother of one previous president and the son of another. The US has gone so far downhill that we can only choose which family dynasty we prefer to rule. If only a Kennedy, a Roosevelt, or a Rockefeller could be thrown into the mix as well＃ Maybe next time. Although I think were due for a general or two. 
Elections are, quite frankly, meaningless. These two corrupt parties, the Republicrats, and the Demopublicans, run by political hacks and funded by interest groups, simply appoint the people that they want and then present the American people with the illusion of a choice. The people who run these parties have become increasingly bold and arrogant. Theyre absolutely horrible creatures, the same types that used to thrive in the Soviet Union. Americans should be ashamed of themselves for treating them with any respect at all. 
However, if forced to choose between the two candidates, I would definitely go for Trump, simply because hes something of an outsider. The media, Hollywood, academia, and the Establishment hate him. And I believe he hates them. If elected, he will likely overturn a lot of apple carts in Washington and break a lot of rice bowls of people who live off the Deep State. That would be an excellent thing. Its also possible he would retract most of Obamas Executive Orders, and fire a bunch of supernumeraries. But he might replace them with a bunch of his own. 
However, its clear Trump has all kinds of dangerous authoritarian tendencies〞dont forget his endorsement of torture and the killing of families of accused terrorists as a policy. He also has all kinds of really silly and destructive economic notions〞he appears to think he can cut deals with foreign governments. That has nothing to do with the concept of free trade. Hes threatened punitive tariffs, something that would immensely aggravate The Greater Depression. Worse, since as a businessman hes associated with the free market〞unfortunately, and incorrectly〞capitalism will wind up being blamed for this depression as well as a result. 
Incidentally, I believe〞as I have for over a year〞that Trump is going to win. Why? Its not just the immense enthusiasm of his supporters, as opposed to the lukewarm support that Hillary gets. Its that Bernie Sanders was the other protest candidate in this election. His numerous and enthusiastic supporters believe〞correctly〞that Hillary and the Democratic machine stole the nomination from him. Theyre genuinely pissed off. I believe only the most oblivious ones will vote for Hillary. A few might be mad enough to want to burn the house down by voting for Trump. 
I havent heard anyone talking about the absence of the Bernie-istas. I dont keep my finger on the pulse of the hoi polloi . But, if Im right, it will result in a landslide for Trump. 
Unfortunately, Trump is no libertarian〞but neither is the dim-bulb candidate of the Libertarian Party. That said Trump is a lot better than Hillary〞this is no time for a corrupt, hostile, elderly, debilitated, mildly demented Statist to become president. So, sure, Id prefer Trump. 
Am I going to vote for him? I dont believe in being complicit in a criminal act, so I dont vote. 
Nick Giambruno: Please elaborate＃ 
Doug Casey: There are at least five reasons not to vote: Voting in a political election is unethical. The political process is one of institutionalized coercion and force. If you disapprove of those things, then you shouldnt participate in them, even indirectly. Voting compromises your privacy. It gets your name in yet another government computer database. Voting, as well as registering, entails hanging around government offices and dealing with petty bureaucrats. Most people can find something more enjoyable or productive to do with their time. Voting encourages politicians. A vote against one candidate〞a major, and quite understandable, the reason why most people vote〞is always interpreted as a vote for his opponent. And even though you may be voting for the lesser of two evils, the lesser of two evils is still evil. It amounts to giving the candidate a tacit mandate to impose his will on society. Your vote doesnt count. Politicians like to say it counts because it is to their advantage to get everyone into a busybody mode. But, statistically, one vote in scores of millions makes no more difference than a single grain of sand on a beach. Thats entirely apart from the fact that officials manifestly do what they want, not what you want, once they are in office. 
Nick Giambruno: What about voting for the Libertarian Party? 
Doug Casey: The Libertarian Party once had a claim to being the party of principle, back in the days when people like John Hospers, Harry Browne, and Ron Paul were their candidates. Then they for some reason put forward the empty suit Bob Barr, an ex-Congressman. 
It appears that the Libertarian Party has been captured by the Republicans, which is surprisingly clever on the Republicans part. Now they have two parties that are registered in all 50 states. Its kind of a backup system to the regular Republican Party. Theyll need a backup since the old GOP is a dead duck. 
Regarding Gary Johnson, I dont know what his philosophical beliefs, if any, are. I suspect neither, does he. The only thing we really know is that he wants to see pot legalized on a national scale. Well, bravo. Im all for that, even though Im not a toker. Its a step in the right direction toward dismantling the insane War on Some Drugs. But does he have any other libertarian tendencies? He doesnt seem to even have a grasp of the basic principles＃ although he seems better than the average politician. But thats not saying much. 
Im especially concerned about his running mate, William Weld, whos an actual neocon. Hes an overt statist, an active promoter of warfare, welfare, taxes and regulations. He has no libertarian tendencies at all that Im aware of. Hes a pure Deep State guy. 
One thing youve got to say about the Democratic Party is that, while their ideas are destructive and evil, at least theyre honest about them. Democrats make no bones about being the party of socialism, and they naturally attract the envy-driven, the class warriors, the politically correct, the cultural Marxists, the race baiters, the gender Nazis, and the like. The Democratic Party is beyond redemption. It needs to be flushed. It has zero redeeming value. 
The Republicans attract a different group. Religious people. Cultural traditionalists. People who generally favor what they think is the free market. They tend to be much more nationalistic and pro-military than the Democrats. But, unlike the Dems, the Reps have no real philosophical foundation. Theyre basically just non-Democrats＃ 
The Democrats can be viewed as the evil party and the Republicans as the stupid party. But theyre really just two sides of the same coin, at least when it comes to their leadership〞who are all Deep State members. 
The Libertarians must now be viewed, at best, as the smart wing of the stupid party. Its a sad testimony to the nature of politics＃ 
The situation has actually gotten out of control, and the government is so big and so powerful at this point that it cant be reversed. Even if Ron Paul were elected, it wouldnt do any good. 
The first thing that would happen is that he would be sat down with a bunch of generals and heads of Praetorian agencies, like the FBI, the NSA and the CIA, who would inform him〞politely, but firmly〞how things really work. If he didnt play by their rules, his life would be at risk. And if for some reason he dodged those bullets, he would be impeached by Congress before he had the chance to actually change anything. And if for some reason that didnt work, the average American would be out in the street rioting, because his doggy dish was going to be broken. Dont forget, almost 50% of Americans are net recipients of government benefits. 
Im afraid that when the looming crisis blows up, the American people〞 Boobus Americanus as H. L. Mencken said〞is going to clamor for somebody to kiss it all and make it better. We could very well wind up with some type of a military dictatorship. 
Nick Giambruno: I agree, Doug. I also do not vote. And there are far more powerful ways to vote anyway. 
You can vote with your money by swapping fiat currency stored in a fractional reserve banking system (like the US dollar) for physical gold and silver. 
You can also vote with your feet by leaving the country. 
Instead of voting for a politician, which only creates the illusion of making a difference, those two steps can actually make a positive change in your life. 
Whats your take? 
Doug Casey: I agree. The thing is that all of our ancestors〞all of us who are Americans〞came from foreign countries. Everybody came to America because they wanted to get away from being turned into slaves in their home countries. The problem is that the US government is going in the same direction as those governments that our ancestors ran away from. Now we have to go someplace else ourselves. We have to find a new America. 
Im very pleased that I can watch all this nonsense on a widescreen in a coffee shop in Argentina and not be very adversely affected by it. Argentina, incidentally, is now going the right way from many points of view. 
Its dangerous to stay rooted in one place when the natives get restless. Ask Russians in the 20s, Germans in the 30s, any European in the 40s, Chinese in the 50s, Cubans in the 60s, Vietnamese in the 70s, Rhodesians in the 80s〞or Venezuelans today. And thats just an incomplete list off the top of my head. Its especially risky if you have some assets during real economic upset, or ideas that arent mainstream when theres real political turbulence. 
Nick Giambruno: Most Americans are effectively stuck in the US. So, looking at these disturbing socio-political trends, what else could happen? 
Doug Casey: Its amazing, and disturbing, that most of the young people in the US support Bernie, an avowed socialist, whose ideas are, if anything, worse than Hillarys. But it just shows how unhappy young people are with the status quo. Justifiably unhappy. 
Bernie and Trump hit the same nerve〞they sensed that were on the edge of a revolution in this country. We really are. The situation is not unlike that before the War Between the States, very unstable. 
Both sides are extremely antagonistic. People either hate Trump or they hate Hillary. It doesnt matter who wins; the other side is going to be very, very unhappy. And with tensions already running high in the country, and racial, cultural and social clashes in the background, it almost feels like a civil war is in the cards for the US. 
Of course, it seemed like we could have had a civil war back in the late 60s and early 70s when there were not just a few, but thousands of bombings. Not just little riots, like in Ferguson and Baltimore, but conflagrations like in Watts, DC, and Detroit, where the National Guard was raking the ghetto with .50 cals. 
But the countrys prosperity was still increasing in those days. Now were on the cusp of The Greater Depression. Things could get ugly. 
Contrary to what most believe, the US hasnt had a real civil war yet. The unpleasantness of 186165 was actually a war of secession. A civil war is one where two or more groups are vying for the control of the same government, as in Spain during the 30s, between the fascists and the communists. 
But this time in the US it could turn into a real civil war. I dont know what form it would take, but a lot of things could be really tough going: economically, financially, politically, socially, militarily. Most important, theres a cultural divide thats arisen in the US. 
I dont think most people are even aware of what is going on. When you walk outside, the sun is shining. Children are still playing. You can go down to the Wal-Mart and buy cheap goods. Everything looks pretty good on the surface, despite the fact everyones credit card is maxed out. But I think its all a hologram thats about to be exposed.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads her Republican rival by three percentage points nationally as they head into the final day of a tight race for the White House, according to a new poll. 
The final Bloomberg Politics-Selzer & Co poll released on Monday has Clinton ahead of Trump, 44 percent to 41 percent. 
Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson was at 4 percent and Green Party candidate Jill Stein had 2 percent support. 
Clinton also leads Trump by three points in a hypothetical two-way matchup when third-party candidates are not included. 
Another tracking poll released early on Monday also put Clinton in the lead. 
The former secretary of state held a four-point lead over the billionaire businessman in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll. The survey showed 47 percent of likely US voters backed Clinton while 43 percent said they supported Trump. 
The Clinton campaign received a late break with FBI Director James Comey announcing Sunday that no criminal charges were forthcoming in the probe of Clintons newly-found emails. 
Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July, the FBI chief wrote in a new letter to congressional committee chairmen.

Comey sent the presidential race into a frenzy last month when he sent a letter to Congress saying the FBI had discovered emails in a separate probe that could be linked to the investigation into Clintons use of a private server when she was secretary of state. 
The surprise move infuriated Democrats and lifted the presidential hopes of Trump, who has turned the email controversy into a favorite line of attack against Clinton. 
Still, Trump continued to seize on the email issue, insisting that Clinton is guilty. 
Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know, he said Sunday at a rally in Detroit, Michigan. And now its up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8. 
Both Clinton and Trump plan to spend the last day of the campaign racing across key battleground states that could determine the results of Tuesdays election. 
Trump will visit Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire and finish the day with a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

DAILY CALLER 
American hackers recently broke into Russias communications networks, electrical grid and government systems in preparation for a retaliatory cyber strike should Russian hackers meddle in the U.S. election, according to NBC News. 
Officials do not expect any major attacks on U.S. infrastructure, which would be tantamount to an act of war, but they are concerned that Russian hackers may meddle in the election by spreading false information. The hacker Guccifer 2.0 〞 which officials and some cyber security experts believe is a front for Russian intelligence 〞 claimed they would be monitoring elections from inside the system. 
The U.S. preparations are no different than Russia and Chinas probing of U.S. networks. The penetration caused no damage to Russia, instead it was the equivalent of a military scouting mission. Cyber weapons could be deployed if the U.S. suffered a significant attack, but officials tell NBC News that is an unlikely scenario. Just to be sure though, Obama administration officials issued a back-channel warning to Russia to stay out of the election. 
Youd gain access to a network, youd establish your presence on the network and then youre poised to do what you would like to do with the network, Gary Brown, a former legal adviser to U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), told NBC News. 
U.S. cyber capabilities are top of the line, but the Obama administration has been wary of deploying them, despite consistent Russian provocation. CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency, the agencies responsible for U.S. cyber security, are incredibly secretive regarding U.S. capabilities. Stuxnet is the most well-known, publicized U.S. cyber weapon. The highly advanced computer worm wreaked havoc on Irans nuclear enrichment program in 2010. 
CYBERCOM is currently involved in cyber attacks against the Islamic State, but Pentagon officials have been especially silent on the exact details of the  cyber bombs  being dropped on the terrorist group. Russia may find itself the next target, should it decide to go from misinformation campaigns to attacks on infrastructure.",english,2016-11-08T21:00:37.324+02:00,amtvmedia.com,US,,US Military Prepares To Shut Down Russias Internet If It Hacks The Election,0,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/74f7cc6254e2f30ed8f738bc9279f5e8.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

WikiLeaks just released their newest batch of leaked emails, and they contain messages sent to and from Barack Obama prior to his presidential inauguration.
The most interesting of the emails in this batch involves a message from John Podesta to Obama regarding an invitation from President George W. Bush to then ＆President-Elect. It alluded to a transition plan that was being worked on before the election took place.
According to the memo, Obama was already discussing his transition into office with the then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. Here is a statement taken from a memo sent from the transition board to Barack Obama:
As you have observed in your interactions with Secretary Paulson, he is apparently eager to involve you and your transition team extensively in his policy choices following the election.
Immediately after the election Secretary Paulson and other members of the Administration will likely seek to involve you and your transition team in their ongoing policy responses to the financial and housing crises. We also expect relentless interest from the press and public about your intended level of engagement with the Administration on these matters during the transition.
Think about this for a second, Obamas transition was already being discussed with certain members of the Bush administration. Also, judging by the email, its clear that it was known that Obama was going to be the president.
Another telling email, dated October 30, 2008, came from John Podesta to the then Senator Obama discussing an economic transition team, and why Obama needed to get the wheels in motion before his term begins.",english,2016-10-27T07:59:43.641+03:00,anonhq.com,US,12993,Wikileaks Releases First Batch Of Barack Obama Emails & They Hint At A Rigged Election,0,http://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/barackobama.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

While the Obama Administration has made much of its intention to start a full-scale cyberwar against Russia at a time of their choosing, the most recent reports suggest that the war is effectively on hold at least until the presidential election in two weeks. 
From President Obamas standpoint, the hope is to work with Hillary Clinton, if she becomes president-elect, to launch a cyber war that they both can get behind. Indeed, both have appeared very hawkish against Russia, and Obama apparently doesnt want to deny Clinton a chance to participate in the early days of a war shed inherit. 
Starting a cyberwar ahead of a Trump win would be even less wise, as Trump has opposed the idea of picking fights with Russia, and expressed strong doubts about Democratic Party certainty that Russia is behind hacks against them. 
Rep. Adam Schiff (D  CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says that another factor is concern about provoking Russian retaliation for such a US attack before the vote, with many Democrats concerned Russia could release forged documents to embarrass the Clinton campaign. 
Earlier this month, Vice President Joe Biden reported that he has informed Russia of an imminent retaliatory hack, and says the Obama Administration will pick a time which will have the greatest impact. Russia has denied any involvement in the hacks.

This US has publicly threatened ＆retaliatory hacks against Russia for weeks now, based on allegations that Russia may have been involved in certain hacks related to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Russia denied involvement and the US government has been unable to produce any concrete evidence of Russian involvement. 
Vice President Joe Biden went so far as to confirm the US had informed Vladimir Putin that the US would conduct revenge attacks at the time of our choosing. The time may ultimately be Americas election day, according to officials familiar with the situation. 
NBC News has reported seeing top secret documents from these officials detailing potential US plans to launch military cyber attacks against Russias civilian infrastructure, with the documents claiming advanced US cyber weapons were prepared to take down Russias entire electricity grid, all telecommunications networks, and the Kremlins own command systems. 
The reports are emerging in the context of US officials speculating that Russia might launch cyber attacks against the US during the election to try to disrupt it. Since they offered no evidence for this either, it raises concerns that the US is simply setting up a pretext for timing its own attacks around them. 
That officials are trying to assure the media that such huge attacks would only be launched in retaliation offers little comfort, given the administrations willingness to claim anything and everything remotely election-related and embarrassing to the Clinton campaign as a Russian plot. 
Such massive US attacks on Russian infrastructure, regardless of the pretext, would likely be seen as an act of war. The US has made clear in the past they would regard cyber attacks of a large enough scale as equivalent to conventional military attacks, and given the scale that it being discussed its hard to imagine Russia would not react similarly.

Donald Trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the November election will be rigged against him. 
""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning. ""Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!"" 
It's a charge that even other Republicans have been quick to refute. Critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the US democratic process. 
""States, backed by tens of thousands of GOP and DEM volunteers, ensure integrity of electoral process,"" Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who is often sharply critical of Trump, tweeted Sunday. ""Elections are not rigged."" 
Jon Husted, the secretary of state of Ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state, also said Monday that he could assure Trump the election would not be rigged. 
Trump's most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls. Before now, Trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early August. 
""And I'm telling you, November 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,"" the New York billionaire told Fox News host Sean Hannity in August. ""And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us."" 
Multiple Republicans told Business Insider at the time that Trump's assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous, as Trump would be the first US presidential candidate in modern times, possibly ever, to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election. 
Allen Raymond, a former GOP operative who was involved in the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone-jamming scandal, called Trump's continued insistence that the election would be rigged ""detrimental to the Republic."" 
""The idea that it's rigged, I don't know what he's talking about,"" he said in August. ""I know someone that rigged elections. I mean, you know, the fact of the matter is Hillary Clinton doesn't need to rig this election. Trump's going to win Alabama and that's it. She doesn't have to do anything. It's painful to watch."" 
Raymond wrote ""How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative"" as a tell-all about the attempt to rig the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election between then-Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, and Republican US Rep. John E. Sununu. Raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the New Hampshire Democrats office in Manchester 〞 a task his phone bank was hired to carry out. Sununu went on to win the election by roughly 20,000 votes. Shaheen defeated Sununu in a rematch in 2008. 
The operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvement.He said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that 〞 not what Trump's talking about. 
The Manhattan billionaire told The Washington Post in August that a lack of voter-identification laws would let people ""just keep voting and voting and voting"" and suggested fraud occurred in 2012 against Republican nominee Mitt Romney because there were ""precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican."" 
""I don't even know what he's talking about,"" Raymond said. ""But this idea that it's 1950 or 1960 and the party bosses are going to roll into Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines 〞 that's nonsense. An election rigging these days means something totally different than what he's talking about. Now it's stupid stuff like what I did in New Hampshire."" 
He said the lack of voter-ID laws Trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus. 
""These voter-ID laws, what's the intention of that? The clear intention is disenfranchisement,"" he said, echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voter-ID laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots. ""You know, there's a reason we don't have a poll tax anymore. Because it's unconstitutional. 
""People don't vote 10 times,"" he continued. ""There might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times, but he's talking about an institutional effort. It's a total myth."" 
He said Trump's statements were an attempt to ""basically sideline"" Hillary Clinton's first four years in office. 
The idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the Democratic National Committee had its emails hacked and leaked, though both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton's main opponent in the Democratic primary, had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season. The emails showed that the organization, which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary, favored Clinton.

According to officials from the Council on American Islamic Relations, representatives from the FBI have questioned Muslims living in at least eight states leading up to November 8, reportedly searching for information pertaining to a possible Election Day al Qaeda threat . Over the weekend, the designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American Islamic Relations) received reports from Muslim-Americans in eight states, who said they were approached by FBI agents who wanted to speak to them about the alleged threat. Those states included California, Washington State, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kansas Oklahoma, Florida and Texas. Hassan Shibly, executive director of CAIRs Florida offices, called the reported questioning completely outrageous, and borderline unconstitutional, telling the Washington Post : Thats the equivalent of the FBI visiting churchgoing Christians because someone overseas was threatening to blow up an abortion clinic. Its that preposterous and outrageous. The people who were interviewed this weekend were asked if they knew anyone who might want to harm Americans at home or abroad. Shibly said all of those interviewed appeared to be of Afghani or Pakistani descent. Shibly says such sweeps are dangerous to Muslim-American relations.Unfortunately were dealing with an environment thats not very friendly to American Muslims, he said. ＆The environment is very hostile to the American Muslim community. On Twitter, CAIRs Dallas-Fort Worth director Alia Salem posted a short video updating her followers about the FBI visits, and offering a series of resources for anyone approached by law enforcement. It was made apparent to us that the FBI has a list of a couple hundred people they are wanting to visit, Salem told the Dallas Morning News .

WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assanges lawyers have suggested that the globally detested, thorn in the side social figure will keep at, and even perhaps intensify, efforts to be fully pardoned by the United States once President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year. 
Assanges lawyers made the announcement after the controversial global whistleblower spoke with Swedish authorities who had come to consult with him within the neutral territory of the Ecuadorian embassy in the U.K. over rape charges which Assange faces in Sweden. 
Assange has been holed up in the aforementioned embassy for years in an effort to escape facing the diverse set of global charges which have been lobbed against him. 
And, as for a pivoted effort for Assange to escape the charges he faces, one directed at attempting to garner a Trump signed, U.S. presidential pardon, Assanges lawyers said, according to Londons Evening Standard , Through U.S. counsel, we had reached out to the Obama administration, most recently just a few months ago, and we will continue to do so with future U.S. administrations until the investigation is closed. 
These efforts at a presidential pardon for Assange began, as noted, under the Obama administration, but with Obamas own federal appointments and the soon to be former president himself as the ones to ever begin an investigation into Assange in the first place, efforts for an Obama pardon of Assange unsurprisingly never got anywhere. 
The U.S. investigation was first prompted by Assanges publication of classified documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan delivered to him by Army whistleblower Bradley/Chelsea Manning 〞 who, mind you, is still in American custody and doesnt seem to have much of a hope of release anytime soon. 
Assanges more recent work, during the lead up to Election Day, quickly turned into an elaborate anti-Clinton campaign, one viewed by American intelligence officials as backed by the Russian government in the interest of seeing their preferred candidate 〞 Trump 〞 elected to the presidency. 
WikiLeaks published in this time frame a huge cache of emails hacked from key members of the Democratic Party leadership and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, targeting figures from the now former party chairperson and U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. WikiLeaks also released many thousands of emails taken from Clintons tenure as secretary of state serving under President Obama. 
The credibility of the emails has been occasionally questioned. Indeed, even if the organization only received and hacked actual emails and the like that had actually come from Democratic Party officials. WikiLeaks was still found, on multiple occasions, to have been improperly spinning the email contents. Such as the time a mundane email about then Secretary of State Hillary Clintons UN translation providing earpiece, was spun into a fake story about Clinton using an earpiece to be fed what she was supposed to say. 
Trump is far from predictable enough for any observer to definitively suggest his course of action regarding Assange once he takes office. He continues to surround himself with figures ranging from level-headed, establishment conservatives like Reince Priebus, to the far right controversial at best conservative media guru Steve Bannon.

Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. 
Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News ＃ 
Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. 
The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. 
If anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election, then they arent paying much attention, Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. 
And without a doubt, voting locations are soft targets that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters ＃ 
There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didnt have 15 or 20 years ago, said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee.  What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then thats certainly concerning. 
All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. 
Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. 
Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania ＃ 
We dont want to lose an election because you know what Im talking about, Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. Because you know what? Thats a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places . 
And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats＃ 
Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. 
Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. 
I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent, Moynihan said. You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat. 
In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . 
Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation ＃ 
According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. 
The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation  apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007  when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? 
Either way, it doesnt look good. 
After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. 
But Democrats dont like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters＃ 
Its un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that , Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book  Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America , previously told The Christian Science Monitor. Voting was very, very dangerous. I dont think anyones suggesting that were at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic. 
Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. 
But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? 
If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed.

The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the worlds gold standard that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The wise men of the system simply insist otherwise. 
We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000). 
The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nations leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized.Strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated. 
Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldnt vote). 
That unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. In effect, the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern non-slave owners. 
Even after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the South, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century. 
Women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks. 
Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedys vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the Souths heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners. 
However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixons Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960. 
Nixons ＆Treason 
So, by 1968, the Democrats once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didnt want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that 〞 with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided 〞 President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam. 
The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixons campaign went behind Johnsons back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnsons Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixons emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam. 
Though Johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called Nixons treason〞 from FBI wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election 〞 he and his top advisers chose to stay silent. In a Nov. 4, 1968 conference call , Secretary of State Dean Rusk, National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford  three pillars of the Establishment  expressed that consensus, with Clifford explaining the thinking: 
Some elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that Im wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual [Nixon] elected, Clifford said. It could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our countrys interests. 
Cliffords words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of Americas electoral system in doubt, especially at the presidential level. The American people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that process. 
To this day, the major U.S. news media will not directly address the issue of Nixons treachery in 1968, despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas. In a puckish recognition of this ignored history, the librarys archivists call the file on Nixons sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks their X-file. [For details, see Consortiumnews.coms  LBJs ＆X-File on Nixons ＆Treason. ] 
The evidence also strongly suggests that Nixons paranoia about a missing White House file detailing his treason top secret documents that Johnson had entrusted to Rostow at the end of LBJs presidency  led to Nixons creation of the plumbers, a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers. The existence of the plumbers became public in June 1972 when they were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committees headquarters at the Watergate in Washington. 
Although the Watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of election-year dirty tricks, the major U.S. news media never acknowledge the link between Watergate and Nixons far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier, sinking Johnsons Vietnam peace talks while 500,000 American soldiers were in the war zone. In part because of Nixons sabotage 〞 and his promise to Thieu of a more favorable outcome 〞 the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to Johnson in 1968. [See Consortiumnews.coms  The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate .] 
In effect, Watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by Nixons strange personality. However, even though Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, he and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, who also had a hand in the Paris peace talk caper, reappear as secondary players in the next well-documented case of obstructing a sitting presidents foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaign. 
Reagans ＆October Surprise Caper 
In that case, President Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 American hostages then held in revolutionary Iran. Ronald Reagans campaign feared that Carter might pull off an October Surprise by bringing home the hostages just before the election. So, this historical mystery has been: Did Reagans team take action to block Carters October Surprise? 
The testimonial and documentary evidence that Reagans team did engage in a secret operation to prevent Carters October Surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding Nixons Paris peace talk maneuver. 
That evidence indicates that Reagans campaign director William Casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostages release before Election Day, after apparently consulting with Nixon and Kissinger and aided by former CIA Director George H.W. Bush, who was Reagans vice presidential running mate. 
By early November 1980, the publics obsession with Irans humiliation of the United States and Carters inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a Reagan landslide. When the hostages were finally let go immediately after Reagans inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, his supporters cited the timing to claim that the Iranians had finally relented out of fear of Reagan. 
Bolstered by his image as a tough guy, Reagan enacted much of his right-wing agenda, including passing massive tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, weakening unions and creating the circumstances for the rapid erosion of the Great American Middle Class. 
Behind the scenes, the Reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to Iran, mostly through Israel, what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for Irans cooperation in getting Reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration. 
In summer 1981, when Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Nicholas Veliotes learned about the arms shipments to Iran, he checked on their origins and said, later in a PBS interview: 
It was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment. ＃ [This operation] seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration. And I understand some contacts were made at that time. 
Those early covert arms shipments to Iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the Iran-Contra Affair, with some of the profits getting recycled back to Reagans beloved Nicaraguan Contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaraguas leftist government. 
While many facts of the Iran-Contra scandal were revealed by congressional and special-prosecutor investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the origins of the Reagan-Iran relationship was always kept hazy. The Republicans were determined to stop any revelations about the 1980 contacts, but the Democrats were almost as reluctant to go there. 
A half-hearted congressional inquiry was launched in 1991 and depended heavily on then-President George H.W. Bush to collect the evidence and arrange interviews for the investigation. In other words, Bush, who was then seeking reelection and who was a chief suspect in the secret dealings with Iran, was entrusted with proving his own guilt. 
Tired of the Story 
By the early 1990s, the mainstream U.S. news media was also tired of the complex Iran-Contra scandal and wanted to move on. As a correspondent at Newsweek, I had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before I left the magazine in 1990. I then received an assignment from PBS Frontline to look into the 1980 October Surprise question, which led to a documentary on the subject in April 1991. 
However, by fall 1991, just as Congress was agreeing to open an investigation, my ex-bosses at Newsweek, along with The New Republic, then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting Israels exposure on those early arms deals, went on the attack. They published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 October Surprise case a hoax, but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording Caseys attendance at a conference in London in July 1980, which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to Madrid to meet with senior Iranians regarding the hostages. 
Although the bogus Newsweek/New Republic London alibi would eventually be debunked, it created a hostile climate for the investigation. With Bush angrily denying everything and the congressional Republicans determined to protect the Presidents flanks, the Democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigation. 
Meanwhile, Bushs State Department and White House counsels office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation, deep-sixing incriminating documents, and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoena. 
Years later, I discovered a document at the Bush presidential library in College Station, Texas, confirming that Casey had taken a mysterious trip to Madrid in 1980. The U.S. Embassys confirmation of Caseys trip was passed along by State Department legal adviser Edwin D. Williamson to Associate White House Counsel Chester Paul Beach Jr. in early November 1991, just as the congressional inquiry was taking shape. 
Williamson said that among the State Department material potentially relevant to the October Surprise allegations [was] a cable from the Madrid embassy indicating that Bill Casey was in town, for purposes unknown, Beach noted in a  memorandum for record  dated Nov. 4, 1991. 
Two days later, on Nov. 6, Beachs boss, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, convened an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case. The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bushs reelection hopes in 1992. 
At the meeting, Gray laid out how to thwart the October Surprise inquiry, which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the Iran-Contra investigation. The prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to George H.W. Bushs reelection campaign. As assistant White House counsel Ronald vonLembke, put it , the White House goal in 1991 was to kill/spike this story. 
Gray explained the stakes at the White House strategy session. Whatever form they ultimately take, the House and Senate ＆October Surprise investigations, like Iran-Contra, will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the President , Gray declared, according to minutes . [Emphasis in original.] 
Among touchstones cited by Gray were No Surprises to the White House, and Maintain Ability to Respond to Leaks in Real Time. This is Partisan. White House talking points on the October Surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 1979-80 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findings. 
Timid Democrats 
But Bushs White House really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received  and a great deal arrived in December 1992 and January 1993  there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 Reagan campaign had conspired with Iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 Americans in order to ensure Reagans election victory. 
That would have undermined the faith of the American people in their democratic process  and that, as Clark Clifford said in the 1968 context, would not be good for the country. 
In 2014 when I sent a copy of Beachs memo regarding Caseys trip to Madrid to former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, who had chaired the October Surprise inquiry in 1991-93, he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task forces dismissive conclusions about the October Surprise issue. 
The [Bush-41] White House did not notify us that he [Casey] did make the trip to Madrid, Hamilton told me. Should they have passed that on to us? They should have because they knew we were interested in that. 
Asked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the task forces dismissive October Surprise conclusion, Hamilton said yes, because the question of the Madrid trip was key to the task forces investigation. 
If the White House knew that Casey was there, they certainly should have shared it with us, Hamilton said, adding that you have to rely on people in authority to comply with information requests. But that trust was at the heart of the inquirys failure. With the money and power of the American presidency at stake, the idea that George H.W. Bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was na?ve in the extreme. 
Arguably, Hamiltons timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave Bushs team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear. Then, Hamiltons investigative conclusion reinforced the group think dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a conspiracy theory when it was anything but. In the years since, Hamilton hasnt done anything to change the public impression that the Reagan campaign was innocent. 
Still, among the few people who have followed this case, the October Surprise cover-up would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed , that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored , and that some alibis for key Republicans didnt make any sense . 
But the dismissive group think remains undisturbed as far as the major U.S. media and mainstream historians are concerned. [For details, see Robert Parrys Americas Stolen Narrative or Trick or Treason: The 1980 October Surprise Mystery or Consortiumnews.coms  Second Thoughts on October Surprise. ] 
Past as Prologue 
Lee Hamiltons decision to clear Reagan and Bush of the 1980 October Surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history. The findings had clear implications for the future as well, since the public impression about George H.W. Bushs rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son, George W. Bush, in 2000. 
President George W. Bush is introduced by his brother Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before delivering remarks at Sun City Center, Florida, on May 9, 2006. (White House photo by Eric Draper), if the full truth had been told about the fathers role in the October Surprise and Iran-Contra cases, its hard to imagine that his son would have received the Republican nomination, let alone made a serious run for the White House. And, if that history were known, there might have been a stronger determination on the part of Democrats to resist another Bush stolen election in 2000. 
Regarding Election 2000, the evidence is now clear that Vice President Al Gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under Florida law than did George W. Bush. But Bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, and then on five Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to thwart a full recount and to award him Floridas electoral votes and thus the presidency. 
The reality of Gores rightful victory should have finally become clear in November 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of Floridas disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that Gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under Florida law were counted. 
However, between the disputed election and the release of those numbers, the 9/11 attacks had occurred, so The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and other leading outlets did not want the American people to know that the wrong person was in the White House. Surely, telling the American people that fact amid the 9/11 crisis would not be good for the country. 
So, senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery  that the so-called over-votes in which voters both checked and wrote in their choices names broke heavily for Gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the under-votes that hadnt registered on antiquated voting machines. Over-votes would be counted under Florida law which bases its standards on clear intent of the voter. 
However, instead of leading with Gores rightful victory, the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given Florida narrowly to Bush. They either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred. 
On Nov. 12, 2001, the day that the news organizations ran those stories, I examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of Gores victory. In a story that day, I suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism. They had hid the reality for the good of the country, much as Johnsons team had done in 1968 regarding Nixons sabotage of the Paris peace talks and Hamiltons inquiry had done regarding the 1980 October Surprise case. 
Within a couple of hours of my posting the article at Consortiumnews.com, I received an irate phone call from The New York Times media writer Felicity Barringer, who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of then-Times executive editor Howell Raines. I got the impression that Barringer had been on the look-out for some deviant story that didnt accept the Bush-won conventional wisdom. 
However, this violation of objective and professional journalism  bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle  was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier. It was about the future. 
By misleading Americans into thinking that Bush was the rightful winner of Election 2000  even if the medias motivation was to maintain national unity following the 9/11 attacks  the major news outlets gave Bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis, including the diversionary invasion of Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush-won headlines of November 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004. [For the details of how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House, see Consortiumnews.coms  Gores Victory , So Bush Did Steal the White House , and  Bush v. Gores Dark American Decade. ] 
A Phalanx of Misguided Consensus 
Looking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy, there appears to be one common element: after the stolen elections, the media and political establishments quickly line up, shoulder to shoulder, to assure the American people that nothing improper has happened. Graceful losers are patted on the back for not complaining that the voters will had been ignored or twisted. 
Al Gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by Republican partisans on the Supreme Court, who stopped the counting of ballots in Florida on the grounds, as Justice Antonin Scalia said, that a count that showed Gore winning (when the Courts majority was already planning to award the White House to Bush) would undermine Bushs legitimacy. 
Similarly, Rep. Hamilton is regarded as a modern wise man, in part, because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powers-that-be, that didnt ruffle too many feathers. 
But the cumulative effect of all these half-truths, cover-ups and lies  uttered for the good of the country is to corrode the faith of many well-informed Americans about the legitimacy of the entire process. It is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times, or in this case, assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest. 
So, when Donald Trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him, many Americans choose to believe his demagogy. But Trump isnt pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000. He actually praises Republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia. 
Trumps complaints about rigged elections are more in line with the white Southerners during Jim Crow, suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they dont succeed at stealing the election from white people. 
There is a racist undertone to Trumps version of a rigged democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process. Hes just not honest about what those flaws are. 
The hard truth is that the U.S. political process is not democracys gold standard; it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the voters.

Mounting evidence would suggest it's getting more and more difficult for the left to claim that there are ""no signs"" of fraud in the 2016 election cycle...though we're sure they will continue to try. Just this morning the Miami Herald noted that two arrests were made in Miami-Dade county on election fraud charges including efforts by one woman to illegally register voters (some of whom were dead...a recurring theme this election cycle) while another 74-year-old election worker was charged with actually "" illegally marking ballots"" . 
A 74-year-old woman tasked with opening envelopes sent by Miami-Dade County voters with their completed mail ballots was arrested Friday after co-workers caught her illegally marking ballots, resulting in an unknown 〞 but small 〞 number of fraudulent votes being cast for mayoral candidate Raquel Regalado. 

Investigators linked Gladys Coego, a temporary worker for the county elections department, to two fraudulent votes, but they suspect from witness testimony that she submitted several more. 

In a separate election-fraud case, authorities also arrested a second woman for unlawfully filling out voter-registration forms on behalf of United for Care, the campaign to legalize medical marijuana in Florida. 

The Miami-Dade state attorneys office plans to accuse Tomika Curgil, 33, of filling out forms for five people without their consent. She also submitted at least 17 forms for people who apparently dont exist 〞 and several forms for people who are dead. 

Police officers arrested Curgil at her Liberty City home Friday morning and intend to charge her with five felony counts of submitting false voter-registration information. 
Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernndez Rundle was quick to praise the ""swift arrest of the wrongdoers"" and ensure voters of the "" integrity of the electoral process."" That said, we, like many others, wonder just how many similar cases of election fraud will go unnoticed between now and election day. 
Our law enforcement effort against these election law violators was swift and resulted in an immediate arrest of the wrongdoers, Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernndez Rundle, a Democrat, said in a statement. The elections department was quick to detect and report these violations to our task force. 

Anyone who attempts to undermine the democratic process should recognize that there is an enforcement partnership between the elections department and our prosecution task force in place to thwart such efforts and arrest those involved. Now we need to move forward with the election. 

I want to ensure the voters of Miami-Dade County that the integrity of the electoral process is intact because our procedures work, White said in a statement. While disappointed by these incidents, I am very proud of the safeguards the Elections Department has in place to prevent these fraudulent attempts, and I commend the employees who remained vigilant just as they were trained to do. 
Meanwhile, Florida isn't the only state with fraud problems as an NBC affiliate in Virginia is reporting that a former resident of Alexandia was also arrested after being caught creating fictitious voter registrations and faces up to 40 years in prison. Of course, Virginia, run by long-time Clinton confidant Terry McAuliffe, is no stranger to election fraud as one democratic organization was already caught earlier this month re-registering dead voters . 
A former resident of Alexandria, Virginia, is facing up to 40 years in prison after he allegedly used fake names to fill out voter registration applications. 

Vafalay Massaquoi, 30, is facing four felony charges related to allegations of voter registration fraud , the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office said. Each charge carries a maximum of 10 years in prison. 

In the spring of 2016, Massaquoi was registering new voters as an employee of a local advocacy group. According to the Commonwealth's Attorney, Massaquoi fabricated applications and used fake names to fill out the registration forms. 

The fake applications were filed with the Alexandria Office of the General Registrar, who reported the issue to Commonwealth's Attorney Bryan Porter. 
All of these reports simply add fuel to the fire of Trump who has been relentlessly attacking the ""rigged"" elections for the past several weeks. The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD

Of course, these are just a few of the people who have actually been caught for their election ""rigging"" efforts. Meanwhile, there have seemingly been an unlimited number of other fraud cases pop up around the country involving everything from illegal voter registrations to dead people voting. In fact, a recent report from CBS Chicago found that over 100 dead Chicagoans had voted 229 times over the past decade. 
Susie Sallee was buried in 1998. Yet records show she voted in Chicago 12 years later. 

Victor Crosswell died in 1994, but records show hes voted six times since then. 

And then theres Floyd Stevens. Records show hes voted 11 times since his death in 1993. 

Its crazy, Sharon Stevens Anderson, Stevens daughter, tells CBS 2s Pam Zekman. I dont see how people can be able to do something like that and get away with it. 

Those are just a few of the cases CBS 2 Investigators found by merging Chicago Board of Election voter histories with the death master file from the Social Security Administration. 

In all, the analysis showed 119 dead people have voted a total of 229 times in Chicago in the last decade. 

Moreover, an ABC affiliate in Philadelphia uncovered similar instances of dead voters in the ""City of Brotherly Love."" 
So, Action News dug through a decade's worth of election and death records to see if there was any truth to the claim. 

Some of what Action News investigation found was stunning. 

Pezzano passed in 2006 . But state voting records show the South Philadelphia native still listed as an ""Active Voter"" who cast ballots in 2008, 2012, 2014, and the 2016 primary election. 

Our investigation also found Joseph B. Haggarty resting peacefully in a Bucks County cemetery. His grave marker confirmed he died in 2010, but records show he voted five years after his death. 

Action News also found Paul Bunch, who died in 2006, also cast a vote in this year's primary which was nearly ten years after death records show he died. 

But, while all of this may seem shocking, in due time, we're confident these arrests and all other instances dead people voting, etc. will be seen for what they really are, namely another blatant attempt to suppress low-income and minority votes.

FBI director James Comey reportedly ignored the advice of Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who urged him not to thrust the controversy over Hillary Clintons emails back into headlines less than a fortnight from election day. 
US Department of Justice officials, Democrats and even some Republicans were said to be aghast at the timing of the FBIs announcement, on Friday, that it was reviewing a fresh cache of emails, which Mr Comey said may be pertinent to the investigation into Ms Clintons use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. 
According to a report from the New Yorker , Ms Lynch expressed her preference that Mr Comey uphold the Justice Department's longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations, and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election. The FBI director, however, said that he felt compelled to do otherwise. 
Writing in the Washington Post , former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Mr Comeys decision was a troubling violation of long-standing Justice Department rules or precedent, conduct that raises serious questions about his judgment and ability to serve as the nations chief investigative official. 
The emails were discovered in connection with an unrelated case, the FBI director wrote in a letter to Republican congressional committee chairs on Friday. That separate case, it later emerged, concerns disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner , who is under investigation for allegedly sending explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. 
Mr Weiner is the estranged husband of Ms Clintons closest aide, Huma Abedin , and the emails were found on one or more electronic devices belonging to the couple, which had been seized as part of the Weiner probe.

With Election Day fast approaching, citizens everywhere are bracing themselves for an uncertain future. Fortunately, no matter what happens, theres at least one truth that voters from both sides can hang their hats on: Political scientists have confirmed that the outcome of the presidential election will in no way affect ketchup. 
Whew! What a tremendous relief! 
Trump or Clinton, whoever takes the office in November, ketchup will still be red, salty, and sweet, according to leading experts. Despite a range of conflicting policies listed on the candidates websites, they are in full agreement about ketchup, a substance neither candidate plans to change in any way. Americans can be certain that a vote cast on November 8 is a vote that in no way alters the familiar appearance, flavor, or viscosity of ketchup. 
Ketchup fans rejoice! 
Whether 2017 marks the beginning of higher taxes for high-income households per Clintons plan or tax cuts across all income brackets per Trumps, ketchup will remain exactly the same condiment its always been. Regardless of how the next four years change U.S. immigration policy, and no matter whether they see the passage of the DREAM Act or the construction of a border wall, ketchup will abide by the same recipe and will be available in the same variety of packaging. 
If you had any doubts about the future of ketchup, it looks like you can breathe easy. No doubt, the outcome of one of the most divisive elections in history will bring about certain changes, but there will be none for ketchup.

If this doesnt prove whats beautiful about America, we dont know what does. 
Politically, Sarah Goodwin and Colleen Cassidy agree on almost nothing. They vehemently oppose the others candidate of choice and couldnt differ more on the direction our country should be heading in. Yet, as this heatedly divisive election cycle comes to a head, these two demonstrated just how powerful a united American people can be when we put our differences aside and work together: Sarah, a Trump supporter, and Colleen, a Clinton supporter, held each others hair back while vomiting out of intense election anxiety. 
In a campaign season as contentious as this one, you really have to stop and appreciate moments like this. 
Though Sarah and Colleen come from opposite ends of the political spectrum, you wouldnt know it when looking into the stall at their polling station in Cranford, NJ, where they both lowered their heads into the same trash can and took turns holding each others hair back as they retched over the psychological toll this long, strenuous elections taken on them. No arguing, no finger-pointing, no name-calling: just dual streams of stress-induced upchuck crescendoing in a duet of dry-heaving. The sight of two people, who have been bombarded for months with messages that the other candidate will completely ruin the country as they know it, patting one another on the back and encouraging each other to get it all out, is all too welcome in an otherwise toxic and polarizing campaign season. 
Need more proof that its possible for Trump and Clinton supporters to overcome their shared animosity during this historical moment of anxiety? Colleen even offered Sarah an Altoid once theyd both stopped throwing up and cleaned the barf from their shirts. Further, Sarah graciously let Colleen borrow her eyeliner, which had been smudged due to the tears summoned by a panic attack she experienced while in line to vote. After checking in to make sure the other was feeling all right one last time, each went their separate ways, having found rare common ground with their political opposites in the form of sickening anxiety stoked by the intense fear politics and extremist partisan rhetoric deployed in the 2016 election. 
Yup, the spirit of Abraham Lincoln is alive, knitting a torn nation back together.

With millions of eyes watching CNN for election results tonight, the network really couldnt afford any high-profile screwups. But unfortunately, thats exactly what they got when John King tapped his touchscreen electoral map too hard and plunged himself straight into a digital hellscape from which there seems to be no escape. 
Ouch. Thats some major egg on CNNs face! 
The night appeared to be going smoothly in the networks Washington studio, until King tried to zoom in on a breakdown map of crucial Ohio swing districts. When the map seemed to freeze up, a frustrated King tapped the Magic Wall with enough force that his whole arm plunged through the suddenly fluid surface of the screen. Before Wolf Blitzer or Anderson Cooper could step in, he had been fully engulfed in a vast virtual expanse of colorful, swirling data. 
With millions of Americans tuning in to watch the results of this historic election, CNN has been forced to press on even as they try to free John King from the computerized map. A noticeably emotional Wolf Blitzer mouthed the words Im sorry to his imprisoned colleague before tapping the board to call up a gender breakdown of likely Oregon voters, the bar graph of which animated right into John Kings spine, launching nearly all the way to the mid-Atlantic states. If CNN producers thought that they had stabilized the situation by urging King to take refuge in the bottom corner of the screen, it did not take long for them to realize how wrong they were. When Connecticut was called for Hillary Clinton, the trapped John King was also turned entirely blue and let loose a horrible scream as if he were being burned alive. This level of panic was matched moments later when King tried to fend off a ravenous piece of malware with just his loafer, only for the shoe to shatter into pixels that the code devoured. 
Yikes. CNN will be wondering for a while how this all went so wrong, and on their biggest night, too. 
With plenty of states left to declare tonight, theres still time for King to be rescued from the computerized nightmare. But with uploading a JPEG of a ladder for him to climb up and trying to shepherd him onto a thumb drive having already failed to return King to the studio, CNN may be running out of options. 
No matter how this shakes out, its clear CNN has a MAJOR technology fail on their hands. Then again, this is just what happens when anchors play with tech toys without reading the instructions.

Things just went to code red though, because Jill Stein has just initiated a campaign to demand a recount of the vote. 
What is about to happen could possibly cause a civil war. Anonymous, the infamous group responsible for hacking multiple high-level officials and agencies, just made a grave announcement: 
Its over, folks. 
They are absolutely taking this from Trump. If you were able to see these stories they already have prepared for us to start running next week, your jaw would hit the ground. 
They are going to find that the results were indeed hacked. They have everything set in place, and have been ready to play this out for over a week. 
All 3 states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania) are going to be reversed and awarded to Hillary Clinton. Speculations are in the midst of who is pulling the strings, but this is undoubtedly going to happen. 
Start preparing for the news to pour in, NOW. 
When Michigan is reversed, it will send a clear message of irreversible corruption; the state had only paper ballots. Furthermore, the votes have already been certified. The stringent program was designed specifically to defend against cyber attacks. 
There is already evidence that death threats were sent to multiple electors, but that didnt work. Jill stein has already raised enough money to trigger a complete recount of the votes in Wisconsin〞the other 2 states are even cheaper. This is BAD News 
Trump may have taken Michigan, but it wont matter. Jill Stein demanded a recount, and as a third party it will be carried out. The election WILL be rigged. January 20 th is literally 2 months away. Do you seriously think they are going to remain idle for 2 months? 
Im a realist〞I call it like it is and I dont care who I offend. But, do not be mistaken. This is BAD news. 
Its already happening. Multiple fake computer experts have stated there are anomalies in the vote that favor Trump. Who have they blamed? Russia. 
So then what happened next? Jill Stein was able to push a recount order on these grounds. If foul play is detected, a recount can be initiated (even if the foul play is completely false and planned as a scapegoat to initiate the recount for Hillary). Rogue Hacking Groups Like Anonymous And WikiLeaks Gave Us A TREMENDOUS Amount Of Factual Information During The Election Race. This Warning Is Not To Be Taken Lightly. 
But wait a second. How is Jill Stein connected to Hillary and why would the recount benefit Clinton? The answer lies in a serious screw-up that became apparent when a bot was found in the donation system. 
Go to the fundraising website and see for yourself! The campaign was started literally yesterday and already has over $4,000,000 in donations! This Is NO Coincidence. Do You Think A Man Who Has Spent BILLIONS Will Stop Now? The Media Is On His Side, Pushing The Entire Narrative! 
Thats not the scary part though. What gives away the entire operation is the behavior of the donations. The funding came in at an absolutely perfect $160,000 per hour. That wouldnt be odd, except the donations continued full speed through the middle of the night when all of America was asleep! 
Jill Stein now has the money she needs to initiate the recount. Where did the funds come from? Soros. The mainstream media is pushing the narrative hard right now that the votes were hacked, even In Pennsylvania where thats not even possible . 
They are openly and brazenly lying about everything. Google, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter are all censoring the spread of this information, creating dissent and misinformation. To make things even worse, the establishment has launched a campaign against fake news, allowing the mainstream media to dictate reality for hundreds of millions of Americans who receive constant news! 
This is BAD news people, and its about to get even worse. There is no reason they would be attempting to pull this stunt unless they had absolute certainty it would execute successfully. 
Please spread word of what is about to come. I will continue to keep you informed, but you must join me in this fight and spread word. This news is being suppressed on literally every channel. We must fight back.

Special Report: Donald Trump claims the U.S. presidential election is rigged, drawing condemnation from the political/media establishment which accuses him of undermining faith in American democracy. But neither side understands the real problem, says Robert Parry. 
By Robert Parry 
The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the worlds gold standard that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The wise men of the system simply insist otherwise. 
We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000). Presidents Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan photographed together in the Oval Office in 1991. (Cropped from a White House photo that also included Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.) 
Strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated. 
The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nations leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized. 
Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldnt vote). 
That unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. In effect, the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern non-slave owners. 
Even after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the South, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century. 
Women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks. 
Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedys vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the Souths heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners. 
However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixons Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960. 
Nixons ＆Treason 
So, by 1968, the Democrats once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didnt want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that 〞 with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided 〞 President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam. President Richard Nixon with his then-National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger in 1972. 
The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixons campaign went behind Johnsons back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnsons Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixons emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam. 
Though Johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called Nixons treason 〞 from FBI wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election 〞 he and his top advisers chose to stay silent. In a Nov. 4, 1968 conference call , Secretary of State Dean Rusk, National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford  three pillars of the Establishment  expressed that consensus, with Clifford explaining the thinking: 
Some elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that Im wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual [Nixon] elected, Clifford said. It could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our countrys interests. 
Cliffords words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of Americas electoral system in doubt, especially at the presidential level. The American people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that process. 
To this day, the major U.S. news media will not directly address the issue of Nixons treachery in 1968, despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas. In a puckish recognition of this ignored history, the librarys archivists call the file on Nixons sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks their X-file. [For details, see Consortiumnews.coms  LBJs ＆X-File on Nixons ＆Treason. ] 
The evidence also strongly suggests that Nixons paranoia about a missing White House file detailing his treason  top secret documents that Johnson had entrusted to Rostow at the end of LBJs presidency  led to Nixons creation of the plumbers, a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers. The existence of the plumbers became public in June 1972 when they were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committees headquarters at the Watergate in Washington. National Security Adviser Walt Rostow shows President Lyndon Johnson a model of a battle near Khe Sanh in Vietnam. (U.S. Archive Photo) 
Although the Watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of election-year dirty tricks, the major U.S. news media never acknowledge the link between Watergate and Nixons far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier, sinking Johnsons Vietnam peace talks while 500,000 American soldiers were in the war zone. In part because of Nixons sabotage 〞 and his promise to Thieu of a more favorable outcome 〞 the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to Johnson in 1968. [See Consortiumnews.coms  The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate .] 
In effect, Watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by Nixons strange personality. However, even though Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, he and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, who also had a hand in the Paris peace talk caper, reappear as secondary players in the next well-documented case of obstructing a sitting presidents foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaign. 
Reagans ＆October Surprise Caper 
In that case, President Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 American hostages then held in revolutionary Iran. Ronald Reagans campaign feared that Carter might pull off an October Surprise by bringing home the hostages just before the election. So, this historical mystery has been: Did Reagans team take action to block Carters October Surprise? President Ronald Reagan, delivering his Inaugural Address on Jan. 20, 1981, as the 52 U.S. hostages in Iran are simultaneously released. 
The testimonial and documentary evidence that Reagans team did engage in a secret operation to prevent Carters October Surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding Nixons Paris peace talk maneuver. 
That evidence indicates that Reagans campaign director William Casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostages release before Election Day, after apparently consulting with Nixon and Kissinger and aided by former CIA Director George H.W. Bush, who was Reagans vice presidential running mate. 
By early November 1980, the publics obsession with Irans humiliation of the United States and Carters inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a Reagan landslide. When the hostages were finally let go immediately after Reagans inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, his supporters cited the timing to claim that the Iranians had finally relented out of fear of Reagan. 
Bolstered by his image as a tough guy, Reagan enacted much of his right-wing agenda, including passing massive tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, weakening unions and creating the circumstances for the rapid erosion of the Great American Middle Class. 
Behind the scenes, the Reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to Iran, mostly through Israel, what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for Irans cooperation in getting Reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration. Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush with CIA Director William Casey at the White House on Feb. 11, 1981. (Photo credit: Reagan Library) 
In summer 1981, when Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Nicholas Veliotes learned about the arms shipments to Iran, he checked on their origins and said, later in a PBS interview: 
It was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment. ＃ [This operation] seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration. And I understand some contacts were made at that time. 
Those early covert arms shipments to Iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the Iran-Contra Affair, with some of the profits getting recycled back to Reagans beloved Nicaraguan Contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaraguas leftist government. 
While many facts of the Iran-Contra scandal were revealed by congressional and special-prosecutor investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the origins of the Reagan-Iran relationship was always kept hazy. The Republicans were determined to stop any revelations about the 1980 contacts, but the Democrats were almost as reluctant to go there. 
A half-hearted congressional inquiry was launched in 1991 and depended heavily on then-President George H.W. Bush to collect the evidence and arrange interviews for the investigation. In other words, Bush, who was then seeking reelection and who was a chief suspect in the secret dealings with Iran, was entrusted with proving his own guilt. 
Tired of the Story 
By the early 1990s, the mainstream U.S. news media was also tired of the complex Iran-Contra scandal and wanted to move on. As a correspondent at Newsweek, I had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before I left the magazine in 1990. I then received an assignment from PBS Frontline to look into the 1980 October Surprise question, which led to a documentary on the subject in April 1991. PBS Frontlines: The Election Held Hostage, co-written by Robert Parry and Robert Ross. 
However, by fall 1991, just as Congress was agreeing to open an investigation, my ex-bosses at Newsweek, along with The New Republic, then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting Israels exposure on those early arms deals, went on the attack. They published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 October Surprise case a hoax, but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording Caseys attendance at a conference in London in July 1980, which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to Madrid to meet with senior Iranians regarding the hostages. 
Although the bogus Newsweek/New Republic London alibi would eventually be debunked, it created a hostile climate for the investigation. With Bush angrily denying everything and the congressional Republicans determined to protect the Presidents flanks, the Democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigation. 
Meanwhile, Bushs State Department and White House counsels office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation, deep-sixing incriminating documents, and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoena. 
Years later, I discovered a document at the Bush presidential library in College Station, Texas, confirming that Casey had taken a mysterious trip to Madrid in 1980. The U.S. Embassys confirmation of Caseys trip was passed along by State Department legal adviser Edwin D. Williamson to Associate White House Counsel Chester Paul Beach Jr. in early November 1991, just as the congressional inquiry was taking shape. 
Williamson said that among the State Department material potentially relevant to the October Surprise allegations [was] a cable from the Madrid embassy indicating that Bill Casey was in town, for purposes unknown, Beach noted in a  memorandum for record  dated Nov. 4, 1991. 
Two days later, on Nov. 6, Beachs boss, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, convened an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case. The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bushs reelection hopes in 1992. C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel under President George H.W. Bush. 
At the meeting, Gray laid out how to thwart the October Surprise inquiry, which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the Iran-Contra investigation. The prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to George H.W. Bushs reelection campaign. As assistant White House counsel Ronald vonLembke, put it , the White House goal in 1991 was to kill/spike this story. 
Gray explained the stakes at the White House strategy session. Whatever form they ultimately take, the House and Senate ＆October Surprise investigations, like Iran-Contra, will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the President , Gray declared, according to minutes . [Emphasis in original.] 
Among touchstones cited by Gray were No Surprises to the White House, and Maintain Ability to Respond to Leaks in Real Time. This is Partisan. White House talking points on the October Surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 1979-80 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findings. 
Timid Democrats 
But Bushs White House really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received  and a great deal arrived in December 1992 and January 1993  there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 Reagan campaign had conspired with Iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 Americans in order to ensure Reagans election victory. Former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana. 
That would have undermined the faith of the American people in their democratic process  and that, as Clark Clifford said in the 1968 context, would not be good for the country. 
In 2014 when I sent a copy of Beachs memo regarding Caseys trip to Madrid to former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, who had chaired the October Surprise inquiry in 1991-93, he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task forces dismissive conclusions about the October Surprise issue. 
The [Bush-41] White House did not notify us that he [Casey] did make the trip to Madrid, Hamilton told me. Should they have passed that on to us? They should have because they knew we were interested in that. 
Asked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the task forces dismissive October Surprise conclusion, Hamilton said yes, because the question of the Madrid trip was key to the task forces investigation. 
If the White House knew that Casey was there, they certainly should have shared it with us, Hamilton said, adding that you have to rely on people in authority to comply with information requests. But that trust was at the heart of the inquirys failure. With the money and power of the American presidency at stake, the idea that George H.W. Bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was na?ve in the extreme. 
Arguably, Hamiltons timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave Bushs team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear. Then, Hamiltons investigative conclusion reinforced the group think dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a conspiracy theory when it was anything but. In the years since, Hamilton hasnt done anything to change the public impression that the Reagan campaign was innocent. 
Still, among the few people who have followed this case, the October Surprise cover-up would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed , that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored , and that some alibis for key Republicans didnt make any sense . 
But the dismissive group think remains undisturbed as far as the major U.S. media and mainstream historians are concerned. [For details, see Robert Parrys Americas Stolen Narrative or Trick or Treason: The 1980 October Surprise Mystery or Consortiumnews.coms  Second Thoughts on October Surprise. ] 
Past as Prologue 
Lee Hamiltons decision to clear Reagan and Bush of the 1980 October Surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history. The findings had clear implications for the future as well, since the public impression about George H.W. Bushs rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son, George W. Bush, in 2000. President George W. Bush is introduced by his brother Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before delivering remarks at Sun City Center, Florida, on May 9, 2006. (White House photo by Eric Draper) 
Indeed, if the full truth had been told about the fathers role in the October Surprise and Iran-Contra cases, its hard to imagine that his son would have received the Republican nomination, let alone made a serious run for the White House. And, if that history were known, there might have been a stronger determination on the part of Democrats to resist another Bush stolen election in 2000. 
Regarding Election 2000, the evidence is now clear that Vice President Al Gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under Florida law than did George W. Bush. But Bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, and then on five Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to thwart a full recount and to award him Floridas electoral votes and thus the presidency. 
The reality of Gores rightful victory should have finally become clear in November 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of Floridas disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that Gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under Florida law were counted. 
However, between the disputed election and the release of those numbers, the 9/11 attacks had occurred, so The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and other leading outlets did not want the American people to know that the wrong person was in the White House. Surely, telling the American people that fact amid the 9/11 crisis would not be good for the country. 
So, senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery  that the so-called over-votes in which voters both checked and wrote in their choices names broke heavily for Gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the under-votes that hadnt registered on antiquated voting machines. Over-votes would be counted under Florida law which bases its standards on clear intent of the voter. 
However, instead of leading with Gores rightful victory, the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given Florida narrowly to Bush. They either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred. Former Vice President Al Gore. (Photo credit: algore.com) 
On Nov. 12, 2001, the day that the news organizations ran those stories, I examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of Gores victory. In a story that day, I suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism. They had hid the reality for the good of the country, much as Johnsons team had done in 1968 regarding Nixons sabotage of the Paris peace talks and Hamiltons inquiry had done regarding the 1980 October Surprise case. 
Within a couple of hours of my posting the article at Consortiumnews.com, I received an irate phone call from The New York Times media writer Felicity Barringer, who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of then-Times executive editor Howell Raines. I got the impression that Barringer had been on the look-out for some deviant story that didnt accept the Bush-won conventional wisdom. 
However, this violation of objective and professional journalism  bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle  was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier. It was about the future. 
By misleading Americans into thinking that Bush was the rightful winner of Election 2000  even if the medias motivation was to maintain national unity following the 9/11 attacks  the major news outlets gave Bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis, including the diversionary invasion of Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush-won headlines of November 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004. [For the details of how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House, see Consortiumnews.coms  Gores Victory ,  So Bush Did Steal the White House , and  Bush v. Gores Dark American Decade. ] 
A Phalanx of Misguided Consensus 
Looking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy, there appears to be one common element: after the stolen elections, the media and political establishments quickly line up, shoulder to shoulder, to assure the American people that nothing improper has happened. Graceful losers are patted on the back for not complaining that the voters will had been ignored or twisted. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. 
Al Gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by Republican partisans on the Supreme Court, who stopped the counting of ballots in Florida on the grounds, as Justice Antonin Scalia said, that a count that showed Gore winning (when the Courts majority was already planning to award the White House to Bush) would undermine Bushs legitimacy. 
Similarly, Rep. Hamilton is regarded as a modern wise man, in part, because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powers-that-be, that didnt ruffle too many feathers. 
But the cumulative effect of all these half-truths, cover-ups and lies  uttered for the good of the country  is to corrode the faith of many well-informed Americans about the legitimacy of the entire process. It is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times, or in this case, assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest. 
So, when Donald Trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him, many Americans choose to believe his demagogy. But Trump isnt pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000. He actually praises Republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. 
Trumps complaints about rigged elections are more in line with the white Southerners during Jim Crow, suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they dont succeed at stealing the election from white people. 
There is a racist undertone to Trumps version of a rigged democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process. Hes just not honest about what those flaws are. 
The hard truth is that the U.S. political process is not democracys gold standard; it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the voters.

The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that no one can resist us. But Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBIs investigation, so theres anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak. Weve published about 33,000 of Clintons emails when she was Secretary of State. They come from a batch of just over 60,000 emails, [of which] Clinton has kept about half  30,000 〞 to herself, and weve published about half. Then there are the Podesta emails weve been publishing. [John] Podesta is Hillary Clintons primary campaign manager, so theres a thread that runs through all these emails; there are quite a lot of pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations. [These emails are] combined with the cover-up of the Hillary Clinton emails when she was Secretary of State, [which] has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI increases. 
John Pilger: The Clinton campaign has said that Russia is behind all of this, that Russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for WikiLeaks and its emails. 
Julian Assange : The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that 17   had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source. 
WikiLeaks has been publishing for ten years, and in those ten years, we have published ten million documents, several thousand individual publications, several thousand different sources, and we have never got it wrong. 
John Pilger : The emails that give evidence of access for money and how Hillary Clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically, are quite extraordinary. Im thinking of when the Qatari representative was given five minutes with Bill Clinton for a million dollar cheque. 
Julian Assange : And twelve million dollars from Morocco ＃ 
John Pilger: Twelve million from Morocco yeah. 
Julian Assange : For Hillary Clinton to attend [a party]. 
John Pilger: In terms of the foreign policy of the United States, thats where the emails are most revealing, where they show the direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East. Can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of ISIL, are actually those who have helped create it.   speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix, Arizona,   by Gage Skidmore) 
Julian Assange : Theres an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, not so long after she left the State Department, to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Now this is   email in the whole collection, and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation. Even the U.S. government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL, or ISIS. But the dodge has always been that, well its just some rogue Princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that no, it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS. 
John Pilger: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the Saudis and the Qataris, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation while Hilary Clinton is Secretary of State and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to Saudi Arabia. 
Julian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton, the worlds largest ever arms deal was made with Saudi Arabia, [worth] more than $80 billion. In fact, during her tenure as Secretary of State, total arms exports from the United States in terms of the dollar value, doubled. 
John Pilger : Of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called ISIL or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation. 
Julian Assange : Yes. 
John Pilger: Thats extraordinary. 
Julian Assange : I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of [the reaction] to their ambitions. She represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. The question is how does Hilary Clinton fit in this broader network? Shes a centralizing cog. Youve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street, and Intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis. 
Shes the centralizer that inter-connects all these different cogs. Shes the smooth central representation of all that, and ＆all that is more or less what is in power now in the United States. Its what we call the establishment or the DC consensus. One of the more significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed and how half the Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from Citibank. This is quite amazing. 
John Pilger: Didnt Citibank supply a list ＃. ? 
Julian Assange : Yes. 
John Pilger: ＃ which turned out to be most of the Obama cabinet. 
Julian Assange : Yes. 
John Pilger: So Wall Street decides the cabinet of the President of the United States? 
Julian Assange: If you were following the Obama campaign back then, closely, you could see it had become very close to banking interests. 
Julian Assange : So I think you cant properly understand Hillary Clintons foreign policy without understanding Saudi Arabia. The connections with Saudi Arabia are so intimate. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meets with Saudi King Abdullah in Riyadh on March 30, 2012. [State Department photo] John Pilger : Why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of Libya? Can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us, told you about what happened there, because Libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in Syria, the ISIL jihadism and so on, and it was almost Hillary Clintons invasion. What do the emails tell us about that?
Julian Assange : Libya, more than anyone elses war, was Hillary Clintons war. Barak Obama initially opposed it. Who was the person championing it? Hillary Clinton. Thats documented throughout her emails. She had put her favored agent, Sidney Blumenthal, on to that; theres more than 1,700 emails out of the 33,000 Hillary Clinton emails that weve published, just about Libya. Its not that Libya has cheap oil. She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state 〞 something that she would use in her run-up to the general election for President. 
So in late 2011 there is an internal document called the Libya Tick Tock that was produced for Hillary Clinton, and its the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state, which resulted in around 40,000 deaths within Libya; jihadists moved in, ISIS moved in, leading to the European refugee and migrant crisis. 
Not only did you have people fleeing Libya, people fleeing Syria, the destabilization of other African countries as a result of arms flows, but the Libyan state itself was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. Libya faces along to the Mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of Africa. So all problems, economic problems and civil war in Africa 〞 previously people fleeing those problems didnt end up in Europe because Libya policed the Mediterranean. That was said explicitly at the time, back in early 2011 by Gaddafi: ＆What do these Europeans think theyre doing, trying to bomb and destroy the Libyan State? Theres going to be floods of migrants out of Africa and jihadists into Europe, and this is exactly what happened. 
John Pilger: You get complaints from people saying, ＆What is WikiLeaks doing? Are they trying to put Trump in the White House? 
Julian Assange: My answer is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because hes had every establishment off side; Trump doesnt have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence [agencies], arms companies ＃ big foreign money ＃ are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves. 
J ohn Pilger : There is the accusation that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians. Some people say, ＆Well, why doesnt WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia? 
Julian Assange: We have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our [Russia] documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up. 
John Pilger : Do you yourself take a view of the U.S. election? Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump? Donald Trump speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix, Arizona. June 18, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) 
Julian Assange: [Lets talk about] Donald Trump. What does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind? He represents American white trash, [which Hillary Clinton called] ＆deplorable and irredeemable. It means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are like the red necks, and you can never deal with them. Because he so clearly 〞 through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies 〞 represents people who are not the middle, not the upper-middle educated class, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting Trump in any way, including any criticism of Hillary Clinton. If you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, that makes absolute sense. 
John Pilger: Id like to talk about Ecuador, the small country that has given you refuge and [political asylum] in this embassy in London. Now Ecuador has cut off the Internet from here where were doing this interview, in the Embassy, for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the U.S. election campaign. Can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on Ecuadors support for you? 
Julian Assange : Lets let go back four years. I made an asylum application to Ecuador in this embassy, because of the U.S. extradition case, and the result was that after a month, I was successful in my asylum application. The embassy since then has been surrounded by police: quite an expensive police operation which the British government admits to spending more than ㏒12.6 million. They admitted that over a year ago. Now theres undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds 〞 so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of London between Ecuador, a country of 16 million people, and the United Kingdom, and the Americans who have been helping on the side. So that was a brave and principled thing for Ecuador to do. Now we have the U.S. election [campaign], the Ecuadorian election is in February next year, and you have the White House feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing. 
WikiLeaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of Ecuador, from this embassy or in the territory of Ecuador; we publish from France, we publish from, from Germany, we publish from The Netherlands and from a number of other countries, so that the attempted squeeze on WikiLeaks is through my refugee status; and this is, this is really intolerable. [It means] that [they] are trying to get at a publishing organization; [they] try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the American people and others about an election. Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa. 
John Pilger: Tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy. 
Julian Assange : I would be immediately arrested by the British police and I would then be extradited either immediately   or to Sweden. In Sweden I am not charged, I have already been previously cleared [by the Senior Stockholm Prosecutor Eva Finne]. We were not certain exactly what would happen there, but then we know that the Swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me   we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the U.S. has requested since at least 2000. So over the last 15 years, every single person the U.S. has tried to extradite from Sweden has been extradited, and they refuse to provide a guarantee [that wont happen]. 
John Pilger: People often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here. 
Julian Assange: Look, one of the best attributes of human beings is that theyre adaptable; one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable. They adapt and start to tolerate abuses, they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses, they adapt to adversity and they continue on. So in my situation, frankly, Im a bit institutionalized 〞 this [the embassy] is the world ＃ its visually the world [for me]. 
John Pilger: Its the world without sunlight, for one thing, isnt it? 
Julian Assange: Its the world without sunlight, but I havent seen sunlight in so long, I dont remember it. 
John Pilger : Yes. 
Julian Assange: So, yes, you adapt. The one real irritant is that my young children 〞 they also adapt. They adapt to being without their father. Thats a hard, hard adaption which they didnt ask for. 
John Pilger: Do you worry about them? 
Julian Assange : Yes, I worry about them; I worry about their mother. 
John Pilger: Some people would say, ＆Well, why dont you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to Sweden? 
Julian Assange : The U.N. [the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention] has looked into this whole situation. They spent 18 months in formal, adversarial litigation. [So its] me and the U.N. versus Sweden and the U.K. Whos right? The U.N. made a conclusion that I am being arbitrarily detained illegally, deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the United Kingdom and Sweden, and that [those countries] must obey. It is an illegal abuse. It is the United Nations formally asking, ＆Whats going on here? What is your legal explanation for this? [Assange] says that you should recognize his asylum. [And here is] 
Sweden formally writing back to the United Nations to say, ＆No, were not going to [recognize the UN ruling], so leaving open their ability to extradite. 
I just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publicly in the press, because it doesnt suit the Western establishment narrative 〞 that yes, the West has political prisoners, its a reality, its not just me, theres a bunch of other people as well. The West has political prisoners. Of course, no state accepts [that it should call] the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons, political prisoners. They dont call them political prisoners in China, they dont call them political prisoners in Azerbaijan and they dont call them political prisoners in the United States, U.K. or Sweden; it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self-perception. 
Julian Assange : Here we have a case, the Swedish case, where I have never been charged with a crime, where I have already been cleared [by the Stockholm prosecutor] and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric? 
John Pilger: Yes, its different. 
Julian Assange : The rhetoric is pretending, constantly pretending that I have been charged with a crime, and never mentioning that I have been already previously cleared, never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up. 
[The rhetoric] is trying to avoid [the truth that] the U.N. formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, I am subject to persecution by the United States.

The illegality under the Representation of People Act 1951 of appeal to religion to garner votes was forgotten as the BJP became the anti-corruption party of Hindu nationalists to defeat Congress. Of course, the entire Sangh Parivar including BJP are the corrupt mafia par excellence in the country. The Verma Committee Report itself showed that the BJP/RSS/Sangh Parivar /Shiv Sena and other Sena gangs were an uncontrollable mafia, a parallel state. But amazingly, and certainly because the Congress itself was corrupt and operated the state institutions as its own mafia, Narendra Modi managed to keep the taint of corruption away from himself personally in the 2014 election campaign and even managed to protect Amit Shah who had engaged in multiple political assassinations to get himself and Narendra Modi to power. He thus succeeded Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister in 2014. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its the perfect time to be an affluent white and politically correct North Side Lakefront  or other kind of  Liberal and sports fan in the Chicago area. Think about it. Your beloved Chicago Cubs are finally going to their first World Series since 1945 and they will be doing a battle against a team with the worst racist Native American logo in major U.S. professional sports: the Cleveland Indians  yes, the Indians. The Indians Chief Wahoo  a wild grinning caricature  is the single most offensive, politically incorrect image in sports today. 
Its enough to make folks forget that the Cubs are owned by a politically active right-wing Republican family, the Ricketts, one of whom recently contributed $1 million to the racist and sexist bigot Donald Trump. And that the Cubs storied ballpark Wrigley Field will be jammed with rich white people who can swallow up secondary market World Series tickets selling for as high as $18,000 . And that the Cubs owe no small part their ability to overcome their  Billy Goat curse  (proclaiming that theyd never go again to the final championship series) largely to massive infusions of big Ricketts money required to purchase free-agent veterans to go along with their younger stars. 
Meanwhile, the liberals party has a presidential candidate Hillary Clinton who is about to become the national governments first female chief executive after trouncing the aforementioned bigot Trump in the November 8 th election. The insane, politically incorrect spectacle of Trump has helped people forget that Mrs. Clinton is herself a right-wing fanatic and a lying neoliberal warmonger  and here I am quoting two left intellectuals who counsel folks to vote for her. Hillarys Wall Street-friendly arch-corporatism and hawkish militarism are well understood in very predominantly white establishment business and imperial circles, where she is by far and away the preferred candidate. This is true even among many normally Republican members of the economic, political, policy, and  in a word  power elite. 
Identity politics provides cover for, and diversion from, class rule and from the deeper structures of class, race, gender, empire, and eco-cide that haunt American and global life today  structures that place children of liberal white North Side Chicago professionals in posh 40 th -story apartments overlooking scenic Lake Michigan while consigning children of felony-branded Black custodians and fast food workers to cramped apartments in crime-ridden South Side neighborhoods where nearly half the kids are growing up at less than half the federal governments notoriously inadequate poverty level. Most of the Black kids in deeply impoverished and hyper-segregated neighborhoods like Woodlawn and Englewood (South Side) or North Lawndale and Garfield Park (West Side) can forget not only about going to a World Series game but even about watching one on television. Their parents dont have cable and the Fox Sports 1 channel. Theres few if any local restaurants and taverns with big-screen televisions in safe walking distance from their homes. Major League Baseball ticket prices being what they are, few of the South Side kids have even seen the White Sox  Chicagos South Side American League team, whose ballpark lacks the affluent white and gentrified surroundings of Wrigley Field. (Thanks in no small part to the urban social geography of race and class in Chicago, the White Sox winning the World Series in 2005  their first championship since 1917, marking an overcoming of the Black Sox Curse  was a smaller deal in the city than the Cubs going to the World Series this year.) 
The World Series might be playing out before a national and even global audience just miles away in hyper-Caucasian Wrigley Ville, but for tens of thousands of Black and Latino kids on the citys South, West, and (in fact) North Sides (there are significant stretches of minority poverty west and north of the Cubs storied ballpark), the games are being played in another universe. 
Hillary, a Cubs fan from the affluent northern white Chicago area suburb of Park Ridge (though also a self-declared Yankee fan during her years representing Wall Street as a Senator from New York [her own words]) isnt going to remotely change any of that. She has a long record as a vanguard neoliberal Democrat (a de facto moderate Republican) going back to the Clintons days in Arkansas, where and when she played a key role in helping move the Democratic Party ever further away from its last lingering commitments to social, racial, and environmental justice and decency. 
I may be a far left radical stamped as a White Sox fan by family upbringing and a childhood on the South Side. Still, I am going to make the most both of the Cubs going to the World Series and of Hillary trouncing Trump. Much as I wish the Sox were headed for their second championship in eleven year (they held first place in the American League Central Division for a few weeks last spring), I have to admit that nothing can beat the heartwarming story of the lovable losers the Cubs going to the October Classic when it comes to boosting the profile of baseball relative to that of the sadistically violent, brain-mashing blood sport called U.S. football. It is a telling tragedy that the beautiful pastoral game of baseball has been trounced by the vicious, fascist-lite spectacle that is U.S. football as the nations favorite sport in the neoliberal era. 
Plus, I have nice memories of my father taking me up to enemy territory to watch National League baseball in Wrigley Field in the late 1960s, before it became a Yuppie playground and a tourist attraction. You could sit in Wrigleys bleachers for $1.50. 
Like all good leftists, I hate the Clintons, including the ones with two x chromosomes  and that includes young Chelsea, with her noxious $10 million condo complex in Manhattan Still, I do not await a Hillary Clinton administration with undiluted trepidation. The presence of a Democrat in the nominal top U.S. job can be usefully instructive for young workers and citizens. It helps demonstrate the richly bipartisan nature of the American plutocracy and Empire. The people need to see and experience how the intolerable misery and oppression imposed by capitalism and its evil twin imperialism live on when Democrats hold the White House. At the same time, the presence of a Republican in the White House tends to fuel the illusion among progressives and others that the main problem in the country is that the wrong party holds executive power and that all energy and activism must be directed at fixing that. It just feeds the electoral and candidate obsessions that do so much to divert us from building and expanding the kinds of rank and file social movements required to bringing about an actually progressive transformation. 
There is, yes, I know, the problem of Democrats in the White House functioning to stifle social movements and especially peace activism (the antiwar movement has still yet to recover from the Obama experience). But theres more good news here about a Hillary presidency. Not all Democratic presidents are equally good at shutting progressive activism down. As the likely Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein (for whom I took five minutes to early vote in a contested state three weeks ago) noted in an interview with me last April (when the White Sox still held first place in their division), Hillary Clinton will have considerably less capacity to deceive and bamboozle progressive and young workers and citizens than Barack Obama enjoyed in 2007-08 . Obama, Stein noted, was fairly new on the scene. Hillary, by contrast, has been a warmonger who never found a war she didnt love forever! Hillarys corporatist track record  ably documented in Doug Henwoods book My Turn: Hillary Clinton Targets the Presidency (her imperial track record receives equally impressive treatment in Diana Johnstones volume Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton )  is also long and transparently bad. All that and Mrs. Clintons remarkable lacks of charisma and trustworthiness could be useful for left activism and politics in coming years. 
For what its worth, the first and most urgent place to restore such activism and politics is in the area where Barack Obama has been most deadening: foreign policy, also known (when conducted by the U.S.) as imperialism. When it comes to prospects for World War III, it is by no means clear that the saber-rattling, regime-changing, NATO-expanding, and Russia-baiting Hillary Clinton is the lesser evil compared to the preposterous Trump. Thats no small matter. During a friends birthday party the night the Cubs clinched the National League pennant, I asked fellow celebrants and inebriates if they were prepared for the fundamental realignment of the space-time continuum that was coming when the North Siders won the league championship. That was a joke, of course, but theres nothing funny about the heightened chances of a real downward existential adjustment resulting from war between nuclear superpowers when the lying neoliberal warmonger Hillary Clinton gets into office and insists on recklessly imposing a so-called no-fly zone over Russia-allied Syria. 
Postscript : Meanwhile, could we save some love for the poor and mostly working class sports fans of Cleveland? They didnt vote for their one and only Major League Baseball team to be named the Indians and bear a noxious racist logo. Until LeBron James delivered on his basketball promise last spring they hadnt won a major sports professional championship in fifty-two years. In the years since 1948, the last time the Indians won the World Series, Cleveland has had two such champions: the football Browns in 1964 and the basketball Cavaliers earlier this year. Over the same period, Chicago has accumulated four National Hockey League (NHL)/Stanley Cup championships (1961, 2010, 2013, 2015), six NBA (basketball) championship (the 1990s Michael Jordan Bulls), two NFL (football) championships (the Bears in 1963 and 1985-86), and one World Series (the officially unlovable White Sox in 2005). Thats Chicago 13, Cleveland 2 (9 to 2 if you subtract hockey since Cleveland has never had an NHL team). That said, Im still rooting for the Cubs for three reasons: (1) I may be from the South Side but Im also from Chicago and have lived on the North Side at different times; (2) the Cubs becoming a dynasty (a distinct possibility given the talent and youth of their team the money behind it) will be good for baseball versus football (3) the truly disgusting atrocity that is Chief Wahu.

Antecedently, does it matter, period? America transcends its historical development, revealing a cumulative trend which pronounces even presidential elections a solemn farce, as a fascistic societal formation, to all indications, beckons. It is on a collision course with its own destiny, inner tendencies, ideology, and class distribution. Exceptionalism represents a tightly-coiled nation, out of maneuverability, fated to consume itself (and possibly the world) in domestic self-hatred, foreign aggression, and international confrontation as a permanent stance. 
What happened along the way? Its unique attachment to capitalism from at least the late eighteenth century ensured a one-dimensional political-structural course which selectively eliminated, ruled out, or weakened non-capitalistic elements〞a purist formation, then, feeding on itself, creating and maintaining boundaries to social change that ensured against alternative values and pathways to the future. 
Whatever arises from such a context is then turned inward and made adaptable to the needs of a capitalist state and society. The Revolutionary War was one of independence, not transformation, so that America, no longer a colonial appendage of Britain, could exercise its own form of mercantilism, internal colonialism, subjection of indigenous resistance. Likewise, the Civil War cleared the historical slate of premodern capitalism, of which plantation slavery, was the linchpin, to the breakdown of all restrictions, ushering in a laissez-faire capitalism which offered no obstacles to a monopoly-capital consolidative framework. 
In bold, by 1900, America now a certified imperial power, the Open Door policy pursued for three decades already ensuring the drive for universalized market penetration, and a prominent role in world affairs, witnessed the removal of slavery into a social vacuum to be replaced by the exploitation of industrial labor, an agricultural economy controlled by financial, transportation, and marketing interests, and, of course, racism per se as the unmistakable heritage of previous servitude. 
What a start toward greatness (!), a background for the antidemocratic modernization up to today and into the future. Theodore Roosevelt would give us the interpenetration of business and government and the battleship navy, Woodrow Wilson, the federal reserve system, regularization of monopoly, and an internationalism inseparable from anticommunism, as witness the Siberian Intervention into the Bolshevik Revolution. By this point, the die is cast, so that throughout the ＆twenties we see, via trade association activity, the privatization of the economy systemically nailed down, the NAM and Chamber of Commerce illustrative of the shaping of the business system. 
The New Deal, under FDR, may be viewed, alternatively, as a break in the historical process of capitalist development, or, on close inspection, a muted effort to graft a welfare state onto business foundations〞as the most American society and social structure could tolerate. But in any case, once more, at a pivotal moment, unable and unwilling to undergo a fundamental transformation. For America, World War II was, by necessity, anti-fascist on the battlefield and with international alliances, yet imperialism and anticommunism had by Bretton Woods defined the postwar vision of Americas world direction, FDRs death confirming trends he might have otherwise altered or mitigated. From that point, 1945-6, no internal obstacles remained or were present to arrest the present course: a unilateral posture of global dominance. Anticommunism abroad had its corresponding red-baiting at home, leading to a long-term ideological shrinkage and encrustation of tolerated societal boundaries. 
Kennedy was Americas guiding spirit for the liberalization of fascism〞intervention, regime change, nuclear preparedness, made acceptable and plausible through policies and rhetoric of the US as a humanitarian beacon to the worlds oppressed (meanwhile enlarging global market shares, financial hegemony, and armed conflict), so that with Johnson and Vietnam America revealed its true identity, which has not changed. In this light, the present campaign and election, filled as it is with copious warnings to the world of Americas greatness (coded for military supremacy), extends the past into the future, lacking only the sophistication, ideological and political, of former times able to cement the image of capitalism and democracy. 
America now is nakedly belligerent, on the war path while drastically streamlining its own political economy, as, e.g., through outsourcing, industrial division of labor, and extreme emphasis on the financialization of capitalism itself, combining internal-external processes to hold its position in a world political economy and power system where unilateral prestige and military prowess no long hold, reducing America to one among equals, an intolerable state to a nation habituated to international success. The strain is showing. Clinton and Trump are both playing to an American public coddled by decades of patriotism, antiradicalism, and, treatment of the environment is here instructive, nihilism, whether through the depredation of nature or ignorance with respect to climate change. 
Clinton and Trump, and the political parties and party system that stand behind them, epitomize the logical outcome, viz., moral bankruptcy, of advanced capitalism in America, in which war, militarism, and defense budgets and production all become necessary to avoid economic stagnation or poor growth, while the ideological reproduction of exceptionalism through its various historical stages ensures a blindness to the human costs of impending war. The election is rendered meaningless because continuity has been preserved with an antiradical heritage now transposed into a setting so whipped up with neurotic frustration at having lost undisputed world supremacy and at home increasing wealth and income differentiation that a paralysis of will is setting in, making the militarization of policy (and, via massive surveillance, regimentation or stringent conformity in the political realm) not only thinkable but operable.",english,2016-10-28T11:00:10.475+03:00,counterpunch.org,US,23950,The Election: Does It Matter Who Wins?,0,http://i1.wp.com/www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/dropzone/2015/06/OGFB4.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Even amidst the bluster, lies, and anger unleashed by the presidential election〞the last of these captured this morning in a vivid photo essay in Germanys leading daily, the S邦ddeutsche Zeitung , I often hear the calming strains of one of Johann Sebastian Bachs most famous arias, Sheep May Safely Graze. The first duty of the president, we are often told by the candidates, is the security of the American people. In this piece Bach presents a sonic vision of safety secured by enlightened leadership. 
Above a pulsing B-flat drone whose static harmony conveys contented repose, a pair of pastoral recorders waft over an untroubled landscape: this is artfully managed nature with no suggestion of the horrors of the wild, nowhere the menace of danger. There are no armies or terrorists massing beyond the verdant hills. When, after two bars of instrumental introduction, the drone breaks into a gentle gait it is not done to worry the listener but to lift the eyes and ears over welcome fields. In just four graceful measures Bach has painted an expansive, tranquil canvas. Over these Bachian fields floats the soprano voice of Pales, the Roman deity of shepherds: 
Sheep may safe graze, When watched over by a good shepherd. Where rulers govern well Peaceful calm is to be felt That makes a country happy. 
Ruling your subjects well is like animal husbandry: manage the flock, be concerned, competent and watchful. Let your charges nibble and roam but never too far towards unknown perils. 
We may have the notorious Bundy gang getting let off federal conspiracy and weapons charges after its attempt at an armed takeover of huge stretches of the American landscape (the rogues gallery of the exonerated is to be seen in New York Times today is even scarier than the just-mentioned photo essay in the S邦ddeutsche Zeitung ), but Bachs aria nonetheless projects a pursuit of happiness that can readily be transposed from its premiere on February 23 rd , 1713 in a castle banqueting hall set in the green hills of central Germany to the Land of the Free on October 28, 2016 little more than a week before Election Day. Heard today, the aria confirms that what Americans want most is a nice lawn; a pet or two; and to be left in peace. 
In the three centurys since its first performance, the aria has proliferating in myriad transcription and arrangements, the most famous of them by the visionary Italian piano virtuoso F erruccio Busoni . Given the works graceful beauty, it is not surprising that in one version or another its a favorite at weddings: having played the thing countless times for nuptial proceedings, I can assert that its popularity indicates that security and stability, not passion, are the enduring foundation of the institution of marriage, and in turn therefore of American democracy. The aria texts praising male rule remains unheard in these instrumental transcriptions, and the wedding pairs remain blissful ignorant of it. 
This Best-of-Bach track comes from the so-called Hunt Cantata (BWV 208), composed for the thirty-first birthday of Duke Christian of Saxe-Wei?enfels. He loved music, but even more, hunting, a proclivity captured by Bach in his musical tribute. At his own wedding the previous year, Duke Christians distant relative, the mighty Saxon Elector and Polish King, Frederick the Strong, had had his jewelers, the miraculous Dinglinger brothers, fashion a lavish hunting cup that he presented to the couple and which is now to be marveled at in Dresdens famous museum, the Gr邦nes Gew?lbe. Bachs music was meant to match this level of opulence and artifice, one which even minor German princes like Christian enjoyed. 
But hunting was not just a topic for artistic representation at the hands of a Dinglinger or a Bach. It was a dangerous pursuit, especially since prevailing attitudes towards gun control and safety were almost as primitive as those held in America today. Musicians were not spared mortal danger. The Wei?enfels male alto and writer on music Johann Beer, who was also among the funniest and most prolific of early German novelists, got himself killed in a hunting accident with one of the dukes. His colleague David Heinrich Garthoff, who must have known Bach, came to the court as an oboist (an instrument often deployed for accompanying the hunt) but got his lower lip shot off while hunting birds. Garthoff was a versatile musician and became the courts lipless organist. 
Lucky for us, Christian didnt hand Bach a blunderbuss and command him into the fields when the composer visited the court for the Dukes birthday festivities in 1713, otherwise we might have been deprived of hundreds of cantatas, the Goldberg Variations, the B-Minor Mass and heaps of other hits and only a few misses. 
Both Countess Clinton and Sir Donald are all for protecting the gun rights of hunters, so this is a movement both could get behind. Indeed, its any gun-lovers dream, even if he didnt〞or doesnt〞have a tenth of the arsenal of the Duke. At the arias start the obligatory horns fill the banqueting with tales of the days daring escapades taking down massive bucks beaten towards the hunting party so that the Duke could dispatch these trophies-to-be at close range. Then the goddess Diana, sung by the famed German soprano Pauline Kellner (also likely Anna Magdalena Bachs teacher), unleashed her own dazzling vocal firepower, shoots off a coloratura melisma on the very first syllable before listeners can even figure out what she was referring to, though the hunting horns have left little doubt: Hunting is the passion of the gods, she sings, following that blast with a line that would make a fine bumper sticker for a Ford F-250 pick-up on the back roads of Upstate New York: Hunting is for heroes. Even if there had been rather too much of the above-mentioned collateral damage among Wei?enfels musicians, this is bracing bipartisan defense of guns and game. While the aria may indeed represent Hilarys views on the second amendment, she could use more than a little of the panache of Bachs Diana in getting her message out. 
Before we leave this hugely entertaining cantata lets listen quickly to the political lessons to be gleaned from the first aria of Pan, the god of shepherds and a lusty rustic type who, like Donald, you wouldnt want to sit next to in first-class. Bach makes his Pan a fun-loving, loose cannon of a bass, who goes off half-cocked claiming that he would make a worthy leader: like Bill Clinton and Donald Trump , this libertine purports to have great erotic powers, and it can only be assumed he thinks these will help him as head-of-state. A pair of brash oboes starts bragging even before the voice enters, making the absurd claim that A Prince is the Pan of his country. The bass sounds-off through a lurching gigue that suggests too much drink. After his opening comic comparison, one about as funny as imagining Donald Trump in the Oval Office, Pan goes on to make a decent point of political theory, though hardly an original one since the analogy between a ruler-less country and a headless body politic was a trope of the time: 
Just as the body without the soul Cannot live or control itself, So a country is a cave of death When it no longer has a head and prince And therefore lacks its best part. 
Pan holds resolutely to long notes on live and rule but then tumbles drunkenly down from them as he runs out of breath. On entering the mortal cavern with its minor shadows and chromatic crags, the drunk goes dark, only brightening just before the close when he remembers that he is after all the best part〞the happy head to the nations body. Its a raucous, rambling stump speech worthy of you-know-who. 
Sumptuous entertainments like this cantata drained the ducal coffers in Wei?enfels such that many of the courts musicians〞including some of Bachs own in-laws〞were eventually owed years of unpaid salary. As a result, the duchy was dissolved by the higher-up royals in Dresden. Even the marital Hunting Cup came back to the giver. If you believe the gun-loving Trump, a similar fate awaits the Americans once the Chinese debt-holders come calling〞and not just to bag a couple of big horn sheep for their trophy wall.",english,2016-10-28T21:59:39.319+03:00,counterpunch.org,US,23950,Bach on the Election,0,http://i1.wp.com/www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/dropzone/2015/06/OGFB4.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

NEW YORK  USA  Timing is everything in an election, and this is proof alone that the FBI has an internal corruption problem as the shady timing of continuing an investigation into Hillary Clintons email extravaganza suddenly rears its ugly head once again days before the election. 

One can easily fingerprint Trump and his team behind this latest Wiener exposure, however it is the corrupt cronies within the FBI who most certainly are linked to Trump that hold the evidence of their own corruption. 
Sure, you say the whole system is corrupt, however trying to influence the elections in such an underhand way is beyond dirty. 
The agency should have a foresight system wherein they overlook such electoral discrepancies, especially so close to an election. 
Comey, the director of the FBI claims to be an Independent however the evidence presented by his behaviour puts him as a staunch Republican. 
Who knows how much Trump promised him after the election is over, no doubt the reward will be delivered discreetly wrapped carefully in little brown bags. 
Corruption is endemic in all levels of the U.S. government however to see it played out so obviously for everyone to see like this is a sign that no one actually cares any more. The apathy and nonchalance is astonishing.

LONDON  England  The real referendum will be the next general election when the people who voted for Brexit (52% of the electorate) will make their voices heard once again. 

The multiple scenarios and variables are too many to discuss in one article, however it is fair to say that any MP who is a Remainer will not be in office after the election. 
With this in mind, the currently unelected PM, Theresa May, will most certainly lose her position chiefly because of her dilly dallying regarding the Brexit process and her choice in putting key Remain MPs in high government positions and Brexit committees which undermined everything. 
Because of the unjust corrupt court ruling today conducted by biased judges , there are calls for a general election to be held before 2020. 
If this happens, there will be a bloodbath at the polling booths however under the current circumstances, if a general election occurs in 2020, there will still be a bloodbath. 
It does not matter when the next election is held, there will be a bloodbath of Remain MPs. Your days of parliament are numbered, so count them well. 
It is probably in Theresa Mays interest to never hold a general election in Britain ever again. Certainly, this choice will suit the undemocratic Remain contingent, such is their allegiance to the undemocratic EU.

WASHINGTON D.C.  USA  The nightmare is nearly over, the 2016 U.S. election will finally be laid to rest today when American voters vote in the first female president of the USA. 

Gladly we dont live in the goldfish bowl of America where the constant news reportage has been beating down on the heads of Americans every second of the day with propaganda and ridiculous campaign advertising. One only has to look at the crowds of brainwashed citizens in stadiums waving their flags to see they are not all there, their eyes exhibit the same hypnotised ten thousand yard stare, their shrieks of support for whichever candidate a call to arms for other fellow lemmings to join their crusade. 
The decision for Hillary Clinton was set over a year ago, and the Daily Squib accurately predicted the final result. 
Again, we will be proven correct, and again, there will be no fanfare or acknowledgement for our accuracy, but thats part of the game of being a maverick, separate from all the others, theyre doing the same old thing over and over again, we do not follow you, we are separate and unique. 
Dixville Notch, an eight vote for Clinton is the first as always, and so it shall go on, further results seeping in today and tomorrow. 
Let us all hope Trump crawls back under his rock after this and is never seen again.

Lee Rogers Daily Stormer October 26, 2016 
Project Veritas has released a new video, part IV of their Rigging the Election series, which shows footage of Democrat operatives willfully accepting what was presented as a $20,000 donation from a foreign source. This is more documented evidence of criminal activity by these characters. It is against the law to accept foreign donations in this capacity. 
The foreign source was actually working under cover with Project Veritas. They ended up wiring $20,000 from a Belize bank that the Democrats happily accepted. Once they received the money they started having discussions with the undercover man about granting special access, etc. 
What makes the whole thing interesting is that they only returned the $20,000 after they realized that their operations had been infiltrated. It shows that under normal circumstances, they have no issue with accepting foreign donations even though it is against the law. 
So far, Project Veritas has released video evidence documenting Democrat conspiracies to commit vote fraud, conspiracies to agitate violence and a willingness to accept illegal political contributions from foreigners. Then you have all the Wikileaks stuff that has been dumped. This entire operation surrounding Hillary Clinton is about as corrupt as you can get. 
It looks as if Project Veritas is slowly working their way up the Democrat food chain in these videos. While this might be wishful thinking, I hope they have damning footage of Hillary Clinton that theyll dump at a time to cause maximum political damage.

In order to push back against attempts at demoralization, particularly from the media, and to rally people heading down the home stretch, its time to start wearing Trump markers in public every day until the election is over. 
That will manifest our greater enthusiasm in an everyday setting, not just what people see from rallies on TV or comments on the internet. It puts a human face on the movement, which does not come across so much from a yard sign (although put up one of those too). 
It is also more likely to have a contagious effect at the grassroots. Even if onlookers dont wear Trump gear of their own, at least theyll be more likely to talk positively about voting to others, assuming they were roughly on our side. 
The goal is not to appear confrontational, as though we were about to man the barricades (that would come only if the Establishment tries to steal the election). Everyday people around you are not the immediate enemy. Those who are uncertain about turning out, or are genuinely undecided, are on the wimpy and cucky side 〞 they just want to be reassured that Trump voters are normal people. 
I guarantee that no one from the enemys side will try to shame or ostracize you in public, in order to send a message to undecided onlookers. Only paid activists bother attempting this, and they only concentrate at Trump rallies or on the internet. Even the strongly committed Hillary voters are too demoralized to confront a stranger. The only responses you will get will be from fellow travelers, especially ones who were uncertain whether they were the only one leaning toward Trump, and are relieved to see someone being the first to break the silence in public. 
Trump has been taking so much public abuse, slander, and libel on our behalf 〞 the least we can do is put ourselves out there, too, whether we get a few sideways glances or not. 
At this stage, giving our public support matters more than giving financial support. The polls are not so tight because of insufficient advertising. Its because a handful of people are still uneasy about either turning out, or choosing Trump if they do. Making those people feel more comfortable by seeing real-life support for Trump in public will go farther than hearing an ad on the drive to work. 
And some of them truly have no preference other than joining the in-group. With no visible signs of support from Hillary voters, that only leaves the Trump side for the conformists to join. Who would want to join a group that is weakly held together, when theres a more emotionally connected group as the alternative? 
You dont have to go all-out all day long, but at least wear a hat or shirt out for an hour or so in normal public places. High-traffic retail spaces are best, like a supermarket. 
Its simple to find places selling Trump hats if you dont already have one. 
Theres no excuse to stay sitting on the sidelines with less than two weeks to go. We need to make our presence known 〞 not just as a warning to the enemy, but more importantly to motivate anyone who doesnt like Crooked Hillary to show up and vote Trump with the rest of the crowd. 
This election is now 100% about demoralization  on both sides. 
We have to keep our morale up, so that our people will go out and vote on the 8th.

Ambition can be dangerous. Not just for the ambitious man or woman, but for the country  for all those who ally with the ambitious person. 
For the last eight years, one of the most ambitious men in politics has been New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Hailed as a conservative darling after taking on teachers unions in New Jersey  brash language about punching them in the face marked his rise as a political force and an up-and-comer in presidential politics  Christie has nearly singlehandedly destroyed the Republican Party in two straight presidential elections. 
In 2012, Christie was considered and rejected for vice president by Mitt Romney  but then gave the keynote speech in primetime at the Republican convention. There, he spent the bulk of his time talking about his own wonders, ignoring Romney completely. Fox News Chris Wallace called the speech the most curious keynote speech I have ever heard＃For a moment I forgot who was the nominee of the party. 
Then, the week before the election, Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast. While New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told President Obama that his presence was unnecessary, Christie invited Obama to New Jersey, then hugged him and took him on a tour of Atlantic City, where they made political love along the boardwalk underneath the cloudy skies. I cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state, Christie said, adding that it was my honor to introduce President Obama. Christie was, at the time, facing down rumors that then-Newark Mayor Corey Booker, who is black, would run against him. As The New York Times noted, The scene played out on televisions around the country like a stirring campaign ad that hit themes of bipartisanship and crisis management  only it was run free of charge. 
Obama surged in the final days and beat Romney handily. 
Fast forward three years. 
Christie was running in the Republican primaries. Hed done nothing much in the polls; his only hope was to somehow do well in New Hampshire. He had no support in states like South Carolina or Nevada, or southern states dominated by support for Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. So, naturally, he used his presence at the debate before the New Hampshire primary  a state in which Rubio was surging following his Iowa showing  to destroy Rubio. Christie rightly labeled Rubio a robotic candidate, Rubio repeated himself, Christie hit him again  and Rubio fell apart in the polling. Trump ran away with the state. Almost immediately, Christie quit the race and fell in behind Trump. Thanks in large part to Christies help, Trump won the nomination. 
Now, with Trump surging in the polls the week before his general election against Hillary Clinton, Christie has struck again: this time, two of his top aides have been found guilty on all charges related to Bridgegate, the scandal in which the Christie administration allegedly blocked bridges in order to punish a local Democrat who wouldnt endorse Christies re-election bid . This story will allow the media to shift its focus to the Trump campaign, since Christie is leader of Trumps White House transition team. In a tight election, it could be enough to hand Hillary the White House. 
So thanks, Chris Christie. 
The Democrats couldnt have done it without you. Tags",english,2016-11-05T03:00:36.461+02:00,dailywire.com,GB,15846,"Christie Lost Republicans The 2012 Election.

Partisanship was strongly correlated with the polls respondents responses: 95% of Trump voters said they were more confident in presidential capacity after the election, with 75% of Clinton voters saying they were now less confident. The same question was put to Americans by Gallup following the 1992 and 2000 presidential elections. Five weeks after the 1992 election, 84% of Bill Clinton voters said they were more confident in his presidential capability as opposed to 23% of George H. Bush voters and 37% of Ross Perot voters.

You know＃. 
What amazes me, is that some Australian, can put a video up on YouTube, letting the world know that a woman, the next presidents right hand, is a Jihadi Muslim, hellbent on installing Sharia and wanting to see the end of western civilization, describing her life, her connections and very dangerous people and yet, the CIA & FBI, who are paid billions each year, cant seem to find out the same? What does this tell me? Well, for starters, it doesnt tell me that the FBI, CIA, NSA and goodness knows how many other Acronyms, supposedly defending America, are stupid and incompetent, on the contrary, quite the opposite. It tells me that the security services, are working in tandem with those who wish to destroy western civilization and have been lying to you from day one on everything. Its somewhat amazing, when one thinks that your average American, who steals a bar of chocolate, out of a store, can be banged up for life in prison, if its their third offence and yet people like Clinton and Abedin, responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands and the barbaric murder of a foreign leader, not forgetting working with people who are no doubt planning the subjugation of the west, under Wahabism, are simply ignored by those, who are paid by taxpayers to not allow this to happen. 
When are people going to wake up? Government IS and ALWAYS has been corrupt and nothing but a den of psychopathic prostitutes, who do the work of the highest bidder. The only way that the western people will ever rid themselves of these demons and of course their Jewish masters, it to smash the system completely and live under an anarchy, where the Jew, WILL NOT be able to build a complex security establishment to protect them. Off with their heads, the whole, damn, lot of them quite frankly.

Here he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of Clinton emails leaked by WikiLeaks this year. 
LD : Despite the enormous populist support for Trump and the extraordinary loathing in which Hillary Clinton is held by millions of American, Assange says that Trump cannot be allowed to win. 
Trump has already indicated that he will not recognize the result of the election if he loses, given the enormous enthusiasm he has generated during his speeches, compared to the relatively tepid and anaemic response evoked by Hillary Clinton on similar occasions. Recent news reports reveal that election related violence is increasing and Right-wing armed militia groups are even preparing for unrest if Mrs Clinton ＆steals the election, as they fear will happen. 
If Hillary Clinton wins this election, as Assange predicts, we can expect riots to erupt all across America. Violent insurrection, in the circumstances of a rigged election, would appear to be more than justified. Hillary Clinton clearly belongs behind bars, not in the White House. [LD] John Pilger ( left ) conducted the 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy where Assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the US. Here is a transcript of the interview followed by the YouTube interview itself. THE SECRET WORLD OF THE US ELECTION John Pilger: Whats the significance of the FBIs intervention in these last days of the U.S. election campaign, in the case against Hillary Clinton? 
Julian Assange: If you look at the history of the FBI, it has become effectively Americas political police. The FBI demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the CIA General David Petraeus over classified information given to his mistress. Almost no-one is untouchable. The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that no-one can resist us. But Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBIs investigation, so theres anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak. Weve published about 33,000 of Clintons emails when she was Secretary of State. They come from a batch of just over 60,000 emails, [of which] Clinton has kept about half 〞 30,000 〞 to herself, and weve published about half. 
Then there are the Podesta emails weve been publishing. John Podesta is Hillary Clintons primary campaign manager, so theres a thread that runs through all these emails; there are quite a lot of pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations. These emails are combined with the cover up of the Hillary Clinton emails when she was Secretary of State, which has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI increases. 
＆Russian government not the source of Clinton leaks 
PILGER : The Clinton campaign has said that Russia is behind all of this, that Russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for WikiLeaks and its emails. 
ASSANGE : The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source. 
＆Saudi Arabia & Qatar funding ISIS and Clinton 
PILGER : The emails that give evidence of access for money and how Hillary Clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically, are quite extraordinary. Im thinking of when the Qatari representative was given five minutes with Bill Clinton for a million dollar cheque. 
ASSANGE : And twelve million dollars from Morocco ＃ 
PILGER : Twelve million from Morocco, yeah. 
ASSANGE : For Hillary Clinton to attend a party. 
PILGER : In terms of the foreign policy of the United States, thats where the emails are most revealing, where they show the direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East. Can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of ISIL, are actually those who have helped create it. 
ASSANGE : Theres an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, not so long after she left the State Department, to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Now this is the most significant email in the whole collection, and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation. Even the U.S. government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL, or ISIS. But the dodge has always been that, well its just some rogue Princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. 
But that email says that no, it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS. 
PILGER : The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the Saudis and the Qataris, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation while Hilary Clinton is Secretary of State and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to Saudi Arabia. 
ASSANGE : Under Hillary Clinton, the worlds largest ever arms deal was made with Saudi Arabia, worth more than $80 billion. In fact, during her tenure as Secretary of State, total arms exports from the United States in terms of the dollar value, doubled. 
PILGER : Of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called ISIl or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation. 
ASSANGE : Yes. 
PILGER : Thats extraordinary. 
＆Clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition 
ASSANGE : I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of the reaction to their ambitions. She represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. The question is how does Hilary Clinton fit in this broader network? Shes a centralising cog. Youve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street, and Intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis. 
Shes the centraliser that inter-connects all these different cogs. Shes the smooth central representation of all that, and ＆all that is more or less what is in power now in the United States. Its what we call the establishment or the DC consensus. One of the more significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed and how half the Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from City Bank. This is quite amazing. 
PILGER : Didnt Citybank supply a list＃ ? 
ASSANGE : Yes. 
PILGER : Which turned out to be most of the Obama cabinet? 
ASSANGE : Yes. 
PILGER : So Wall Street decides the cabinet of the President of the United States? 
ASSANGE : If you were following the Obama campaign back then, closely, you could see it had become very close to banking interests. So I think you cant properly understand Hillary Clintons foreign policy without understanding Saudi Arabia. The connections with Saudi Arabia are so intimate. 
＆Libya is Hillary Clintons war PILGER : Why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of Libya? Can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us  told you  about what happened there? Because Libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in Syria: the ISIL, jihadism, and so on. And it was almost Hillary Clintons invasion. What do the emails tell us about that? 
ASSANGE : Libya, more than anyone elses war, was Hillary Clintons war. Barak Obama initially opposed it. Who was the person championing it? Hillary Clinton. Thats documented throughout her emails. She had put her favoured agent, Sidney Blumenthal, on to that; theres more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand Hillary Clinton emails that weve published, just about Libya. Its not that Libya has cheap oil. She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state 〞 something that she would use in her run-up to the general election for President. 
So in late 2011 there is an internal document called the Libya Tick Tock that was produced for Hillary Clinton, and its the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state, which resulted in around 40,000 deaths within Libya; jihadists moved in, ISIS moved in, leading to the European refugee and migrant crisis. 
Not only did you have people fleeing Libya, people fleeing Syria, the destabilisation of other African countries as a result of arms flows, but the Libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. Libya faces along to the Mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of Africa. So all problems, economic problems and civil war in Africa 〞 previously people fleeing those problems didnt end up in Europe because Libya policed the Mediterranean. That was said explicitly at the time, back in early 2011 by Gaddafi: ＆What do these Europeans think theyre doing, trying to bomb and destroy the Libyan State? Theres going to be floods of migrants out of Africa and jihadists into Europe, and this is exactly what happened. 
＆Trump wont be permitted to win 
PILGER : You get complaints from people saying, ＆What is WikiLeaks doing? Are they trying to put Trump in the White House? 
ASSANGE : My answer is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because hes had every establishment off side; Trump doesnt have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence agencies, arms companies＃ big foreign money ＃ are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves. 
PILGER : There is the accusation that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians. Some people say, ＆Well, why doesnt WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia? 
ASSANGE : We have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our Russia documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up. 
PILGER : Do you yourself take a view of the U.S. election? Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump? 
ASSANGE : Lets talk about Donald Trump. What does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind? He represents American white trash, which Hillary Clinton called ＆deplorable and irredeemable. It means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are like the red necks, and you can never deal with them. Because he so clearly 〞 through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies 〞 represents people who are not the middle, not the upper middle educated class, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting Trump in any way, including any criticism of Hillary Clinton. If you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, that makes absolute sense. 
＆US attempting to squeeze WikiLeaks through my refugee status 
PILGER : Id like to talk about Ecuador, the small country that has given you refuge and political asylum in this embassy in London. Now Ecuador has cut off the internet from here where were doing this interview, in the Embassy, for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the U.S. election campaign. Can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on Ecuadors support for you? 
ASSANGE : Lets let go back four years. I made an asylum application to Ecuador in this embassy, because of the U.S. extradition case, and the result was that after a month, I was successful in my asylum application. The embassy since then has been surrounded by police: quite an expensive police operation which the British government admits to spending more than ㏒12.6 million. They admitted that over a year ago. Now theres undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds 〞 so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of London between Ecuador, a country of sixteen million people, and the United Kingdom, and the Americans who have been helping on the side. So that was a brave and principled thing for Ecuador to do. Now we have the U.S. election campaign, the Ecuadorian election is in February next year, and you have the White House feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing. 
WikiLeaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of Ecuador, from this embassy or in the territory of Ecuador; we publish from France, we publish from, from Germany, we publish from The Netherlands and from a number of other countries, so that the attempted squeeze on WikiLeaks is through my refugee status; and this is, this is really intolerable. It means that [they] are trying to get at a publishing organisation; they try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the American people and others about an election. 
PILGER : Tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy. 
ASSANGE : I would be immediately arrested by the British police and I would then be extradited either immediately to the United States or to Sweden. In Sweden I am not charged, I have already been previously cleared by the Senior Stockholm Prosecutor Eva Finne. We were not certain exactly what would happen there, but then we know that the Swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the United States we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the U.S. has requested since at least 2000. So over the last fifteen years, every single person the U.S. has tried to extradite from Sweden has been extradited, and they refuse to provide a guarantee [that wont happen]. 
PILGER : People often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here. 
ASSANGE : Look, one of the best attributes of human beings is that theyre adaptable; one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable. They adapt and start to tolerate abuses, they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses, they adapt to adversity and they continue on. So in my situation, frankly, Im a bit institutionalised 〞 this [the embassy] is the world ＃ its visually the world for me. 
PILGER : Its the world without sunlight, for one thing, isnt it? 
ASSANGE : Its the world without sunlight, but I havent seen sunlight in so long, I dont remember it. 
PILGER : Yes. 
ASSANGE : So , yes, you adapt. The one real irritant is that my young children 〞 they also adapt. They adapt to being without their father. Thats a hard, hard adaption which they didnt ask for. 
PILGER : Do you worry about them? 
ASSANGE : Yes, I worry about them; I worry about their mother. 
＆I am innocent and in arbitrary detention 
PILGER : Some people would say, ＆Well, why dont you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to Sweden? 
ASSANGE : The U.N. [the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention] has looked into this whole situation. They spent eighteen months in formal, adversarial litigation. So its me and the U.N. verses Sweden and the U.K. Whos right? The U.N. made a conclusion that I am being arbitrarily detained illegally, deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the United Kingdom and Sweden, and that those countries must obey. It is an illegal abuse. It is the United Nations formally asking, ＆Whats going on here? What is your legal explanation for this? Assange says that you should recognise his asylum. And here is. 
Sweden formally writing back to the United Nations to say, ＆No, were not going to recognise the UN ruling, so leaving open their ability to extradite. 
I just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press, because it doesnt suit the Western establishment narrative 〞 that yes, the West has political prisoners, its a reality, its not just me, theres a bunch of other people as well. The West has political prisoners. Of course, no state accepts that it should call the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons, political prisoners. They dont call them political prisoners in China, they dont call them political prisoners in Azerbaijan and they dont call them political prisoners in the United States, U.K. or Sweden; it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self-perception. 
ASSANGE : Here we have a case, the Swedish case, where I have never been charged with a crime, where I have already been cleared by the Stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric? 
PILGER : Yes, its different. 
ASSANGE : The rhetoric is pretending, constantly pretending that I have been charged with a crime, and never mentioning that I have been already previously cleared, never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up. 
The rhetoric is trying to avoid the truth that the U.N. formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, I am subject to persecution by the United States.",english,2016-11-06T11:32:27.734+02:00,darkmoon.me,ME,,Explosive Assange/Pilger Interview on US Election: Expect Riots if Hillary Wins,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

THE GREAT DEBATE BEGINS: Well know who is right tomorrow! 
SARDONICUS (to Flopot) : I know it makes your blood boil to consider the lesser of two evils scenario. But LD has always been a conscientious non-voter and is therefore unlikely to be voting for either Trump or Hillary. Nor am I for that matter, since I am a UK resident and do not get to vote in the American elections. 
You really must reconcile yourself, Flopot, to the fact that Hillary is held in such visceral loathing that her millions of haters feel they have no option but to vote for her opponent, Donald Trump, even though they are aware of the Donalds many faults and his Zionist connections. 
Its either not voting at all or voting for the lesser of two evils. 
FLOPOT : You dont understand the meaning of lesser of two evils. It is a con trick; it doesnt exist. Donald will pursue the same globalist wars and cultural revolutions as any other Zionist puppet. It is a meme that exists to get your consent to continue the same evil. 
HARBINGER: Hear hear. Exactly Flopot. As Ive stated umpteen times, Trump is good cop, Hillary is bad. But sadly, Sardonicus does not see the ＆grand plan even though the likes of Zbigniew Brzezinski and Carroll Quigley do, both very much part of that process. 
There is not one politician in the west who becomes what they are, without a careful vetting procedure. Classic example is Jeremy Corbin , whom many thought was going to be the saviour of Labour and take it to the Zionists, when he has proven without any shadow of a doubt that hes a rampant Zionist, even though who goes on pro Palestine marches. 
Trump is a puppet. Clinton is a puppet. May is a puppet. Merkel is a puppet＃.. There is not ONE politician in the west who isnt part of the ＆grand plan and its why everything works according to plan. 
SARDONICUS (to Flopot and Harbinger) : Yes, I understand exactly what both you and Harbinger are saying and I can sympathize with your viewpoint. You are saying there is NO LESSER OF TWO EVILS here since both candidates are EQUALLY EVIL. Because both are Zionists and will deliver a program to further Jewish interests. Thats what youre saying, right? 
The only difference, as Harbie indicates, is that one of these two candidates is playing the bad cop (Hillary) and the other is playing the good cop (Trump). So its nonsense to vote for the good cop as the lesser of two evils when both cops are equally evil when the chips are down. 
This is your argument and I can sympathize with it only if you are correct in your initial assumption that Trump has no redeeming features whatever and is a total charlatan and liar who will break every single promise of his if he gets into the White House. 
You are entitled to that assumption, but you are NOT entitled to believe that your assumption is universally shared. Kevin MacDonald certainly doesnt believe that Trump is a thorough scoundrel who will sell all White America down the river as soon as he is elected. Nor do the thousands of White Nationalists and other White Americans who share MacDonalds perfectly acceptable and intellectually defensible views. 
These millions of Trump supporters do NOT believe that Trump is an unmitigated scoundrel who will break his promise to build a wall to keep the Mexicans out. Trump has said he has no intention of starting a war with Russia. Hillary has made no such promise. Trump has said he will crack down on illegal immigrants, especially Muslim immigrants from hostile Muslim states. Well, MacDonald and his White Nationalists are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt. 
I for one refuse to think that Kevin MacDonald and the millions who are hoping for a resurgence of White ethnic interests are deluded and mistaken in their advocacy of Donald Trump. They could be right. Trump could be their man and actually deliver the goods, i.e., improve the lives of millions of White Americans who are now suffering under Jewish hegemony and a multiculturalism that has gone mad. 
The pessimism both of you share in regard to the irredeemable character of Donald Trump is simply a subjective state of mind. Its an opinion, not a fact. 
I may choose to say, I cant stand garlic and onions. This makes me a garlic-and-onion pessimist. My subjective viewpoint that garlic and onions are horrible vegetables does not make it a scientific fact that garlic and onions are horrible vegetables. The garlic and onion eaters of the world are entitled to tell me to get lost if I told everyone to give up eating garlic and onions. 
So it is with Flopot and Harbinger with their Trump pessimism. They are making a logical mistake in confusing impressions with facts. It is not a FACT that Trump is a scoundrel; at the most it is a subjective opinion. 
HP : Trump is not a politician who has been a politician who grew up a politician and lived and breathed politics all his adult life. Apart from business/social, of course. 
Hes an Alpha businessman who just happens to be waaay more intelligent and personally powerful than 99% of the political mediocres who envy and hate him. 
He came from out of nowhere and like a freight train rolled right over them before they could even cry foul or man an offense against him based on their default slime factor M.O. 
Hell, he vetted them ! Even as the entire weight of the political, M$M, Hollywood, Academia, foreigners, etc., etc., set upon him like no other in memory near or far. But they couldnt even put a dent in him, or scare him off, and you know the vile demons tried very hard. 
He didnt scare. But he did and does scare them. A lot. 
Being a uber-quick study, he easily overtook and surpassed the half-bright bureaucrat politicians and within one solitary year he IS The Alpha Politician. 
Putin (and his 12 time zones full of natural resources) will no doubt enjoy Trump. Putin will respect his intelligence, embrace his personality, utilize his uber-business talents and skills, and very very importantly, hugely importantly.. share their big big patriotism for their nations, their citizens.. 
In other words: The world gets an early Christmas present this year! 
UNGENIUS: Well said, HP! I would add only one statement: Trump is not a murderer, but Killery is a murderer of long standing which should make a choice simple between the two. 
GILBERT HUNTLY: Sardonicus, thanks for your healthy and sane perspective! Well said! ?? 
LOBRO: Seconding that. And add HPs perceptive comment [ above ] to the score for level headed reason. 
ARIADNATHEO: Sardonicus, Harbinger and Flopot: You are all wrong, as I used to be, I admit. 
Jewish hegemony, zionism ＃. are nothing but red herrings that distract our attention from the real enemy. Its not Jews, Jews, Jews, its Goyim, goyim, goyim. I owe it to Amy Martin to have finally understood who are, to cite her the two more powerful lobbyists in the US 〞 the Podesta brothers!

How they could steal the election from Trump even if he is announced the winner next Tuesday 
By Dr. Patrick Slattery 〞 There has been a great deal of talk recently about the rigging of elections. Trump talks about it, and then the media accuses him of being a threat to democracy by refusing to accept the will of the voters. Nobody asks Hillary if she will accept the will of the voters＃ 
Of course, we know that our electoral system is unfair, biased, and even rigged at a variety of levels. Without going into detail, the media, which plays an absolutely crucial role in staging our elections, has abandoned even the pretense of neutrality. Ballot access is unfair. Campaign finance is corrupt. Electronic voting machines are vulnerable. Voting by foreigners and dead people exists, as does multiple voting by individuals. 
But one massive threat has so far gone completely unmentioned: the vulnerability of the electoral college to post-election shenanigans. 
What people are not aware of is that, under the Constitution, the president is not elected on November 8. The Tuesday after the first Monday in November is designated for Congressional elections. It just so happens that over the years all the states decided to have their electors to the Electoral College selected by the voters on that day. In the early days of the Republic, it was actually more common for state legislatures to select the electors, and the Constitution allows the state legislatures to determine how the electors are selected. 
It is actually the Electoral College that elects the president, and that happens on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, which this year will be December 19. On this day, the electors will meet in their respective state capitals to cast their ballots, which will then be sent to Washington to be opened by Vice President Biden before a joint session of Congress on January 6 of next year. Some of you may remember the scene from Michael Moores Fahrenheit 911 showing Vice President Gore reading votes that elected President Bush, ironically denying the objections raised by some Congressmen to Floridas electoral votes, which Bush won over Gore amidst the greatest of controversy. 
So if this system is enshrined in the Constitution, what could possibly go wrong? Plenty. 
Unless Hillary goes into complete meltdown over the next week, a Trump victory on November 8 will likely be a narrow one in terms of the electoral college map. One very plausible scenario has Trump losing Pennsylvania but winning the rest of the main battleground states plus one of Maines congressional districts. (Maine, along with Nebraska, allow for electors to be elected on a congressional district basis rather than winner-take-all.) Under this scenario, 270 Republican electors would be elected, a bare majority, while 268 Democrat electors would be elected. 
Notice I did not say Trump would get 270 electoral votes, which is what we are used to hearing. The fact is that the electoral votes are not cast until December 19, and there is no guarantee that every single one of the 270 Republican electors would actually vote for Trump. Do you remember a few months ago how alarmed we were at the prospect of supposed Trump delegates to the Republican National Convention deserting Trump and voting for Cruz? It was only that Trump piled up such large victories in the final primaries that he had big enough majority of delegates to cause the Never Trump people in the Republican establishment to give up on rigging the convention. 
So who are these electors? Just as the method of electing the electors is left up to the states, the method for nominating the candidates for the electoral college is also left up to the states. Some states allow the presidential candidates to nominate their own slate of electors. Presumably, these people could be counted on to be loyal. But in other states the partys slate of electors is chosen at state party conventions and even electoral district conventions. 
As a young man I attended one such convention and had my name put into nomination as a Democratic elector. Myself and the other three contenders then made short speeches to the convention. The other three talked about being precinct captains or hard-working party volunteers. Then I gave a speech calling for the direct election of the president and the abolition of the electoral college. I got a huge round of applause. I would have easily won, but as a matter of principle I withdrew my name from nomination. 
The point of the story is that most of the electors are unknown to the public, typically cogs in the party apparatus, and not even necessarily high-level ones, and some of them may even be smooth-talking slicksters like me, unknown to the party itself. 
So how likely is it that one or more Republican electors would betray Trump? Such a person is known as a faithless elector, and while faithless electors have never ultimately altered the outcome of a presidential election, there have been 179 faithless electors in our history. In fact, faithless electors caused the Congress to have to decide the 1836 election for Vice President. 
It is true that about half the states have laws punishing faithless voters, but in all but a few states the votes of faithless electors would still count. 
The nightmare situation would be after a close election the Hillary people, or the Never Trump people, could bribe or pressure Republican electors, some of whom may not like Trump anyway, not to vote for Trump. They could vote for Hillary, they could vote for Pence, they could vote for anyone else, or they could even abstain from voting. 
Then what happens? If enough Republican electors are cajoled into voting for Hillary (in the above 270-268 scenario, it would only require two), then Hillary gets inaugurated on January 20. If its a tie, then the House of Representatives breaks the tie. Obviously, there have been Republican members of the House that say they wont vote for Trump for president in November, so there is no reason to assume they would vote for him in January. 
However, not only are Republicans likely to retain a significant majority in the House, but the voting for president by the House is not one vote for each representative, but one vote per state. This means that California, which currently has 39 Democratic representatives, would get only one vote, while Alaskas single representative, who is a Republican, would also get one vote. This heavily favors the Republicans and means that if Hillary cannot flip enough Republican electors to herself to win a majority of the electoral votes, she is finished. There is no real prospect of the House of Representative electing Hillary. 
But what if enough Republican electors vote for other people, Paul Ryan for example, so that no candidate gets a majority? Then the House of Representatives gets to choose between the top three vote finishers in the electoral college vote. You could get a coalition between Democrats and Republican defectors that would deny Trump the presidency and give it to someone like Ryan. (The same applies in the case that Mormon ex-CIA operative and never-Trump independent presidential candidate Evan McMullen wins Utah , which some polls predict is possible.) 
While none of the above scenarios may come to pass, we do have to face the fact that the establishment has so far stopped at nothing to try to defeat Trump, and so it is not too far fetched to think that they would try these tactics, especially if the November 8 voting produces a very narrow victory for Trump. The media could start inventing more reasons why Trump is uniquely unfit to become president and claim that the Constitution allows for these scenarios (which is the case), and that this in fact was why the framers of the Constitution created the Electoral College (which is not the case). 
It would then be incumbent on us to make it clear to the members of the Electoral College and the Congress that any violation of the peoples will would not be tolerated.",english,2016-10-31T10:59:32.036+02:00,davidduke.com,US,,How they could steal the election from Trump even if he is announced the winner next Tuesday,0,https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,hate,Neutral

Dr. Duke and Andrew Anglin discuss the most important vote and election of our lives! 
Today Dr. Duke had Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin as his guest for the hour. They talked about the importance of the election tomorrow. They remarked that the Clinton campaign makes baseless accusations that the Russians could hack our voting machines to manipulate the election, but then insisting that Trump is beyond the pale for suggesting that the Hillary forces could possibly rig the vote. 
They also talked about New York Times columnist David Brooks admission on the PBS News Hour that as a result of globalization, immigration, and feminism, white men in America have been displaced,shafted, and ruined, and that their support for Trump is due to them going with their gene pool. Brooks, a Jewish Republican, says the one person he cannot support for President is Donald Trump. 
And now, a message from Andrew Anglin: 
Meanwhile, the media is admitting that voting machines will be hacked . 
We have to overwhelm the polls tomorrow. You must get everyone you know to vote . Call them right now. Dont wait. Go through your phonebook on your cellphone and call up every single person you know who is not a totally liberal commie, and make sure they are going to vote. Offer to give them a ride if they need it. 
Lets do this, people. 
Immediately following the show Dr. Duke got an mailbox full of emails saying this was the most powerful and inspiring radio broadcast they ever heard! Spread it around.

Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Lets hope that it doesnt happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton . And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day＃ 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are very concerned. Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are very confident about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trumps star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax＃ 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trumps star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trumps star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June ＃ 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidates star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, s omeone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina . On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted Nazi Republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece＃ 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, Why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement? 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ＆some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back. Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a Blue Lives Matter shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if Donald Trump loses the election＃ 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, On November 8th, Im voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, Im grabbing my musket. You in? 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today ＃ 
Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, Ive been buying a lot more ammunition, says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigans Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clintons political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month ＃ 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it. Don't forget to follow the D.C.

If you look at the numbers, there is no way that Hillary Clinton could possibly win the election without the support of a substantial percentage of evangelical Christian voters. In fact, if evangelical Christians stuck together they could pretty much elect whoever they want as president. According to the Pew Research Center, 35 percent of all adults in the United States identify themselves as evangelical or born again, and it has been estimated that there are 94 million evangelical Christian adults in this country. If evangelical Christians acted as a single voting block they could determine the outcome of every single presidential election. Unfortunately, that simply is not going to happen. 
A survey that was recently conducted by LifeWay Research found that only 45 percent of Christian evangelicals plan to vote for Donald Trump and 31 percent of Christian evangelicals plan to vote for Hillary Clinton. 
That same survey discovered that moral issues are becoming increasingly unimportant to evangelical voters＃ Overall, the economy is the top concern for Americans regardless of religious affiliation (30%). National security (17%) and personal character (17%) also are significant issues. Supreme Court nominees (10%), immigration (5%), religious freedom (2%), and abortion (1%) are less important . For churchgoers and those with evangelical beliefs, their pocketbook and personal safety are paramount, said McConnell. Moral issues arent a priority for many of them. 
I dont know how in the world abortion could come in at only 1 percent. Even if you add  Supreme Court nominees  and abortion together, you still only get a total of 11 percent. 
This just shows that evangelicals in America have their priorities way out of order. 
And unfortunately for Donald Trump, he is getting a lot less support from evangelicals than other recent presidential candidates received. According to the New York Times , previous candidates have generally received about 80 percent support from white evangelical voters, but Donald Trump is only getting about 65 to 70 percent support, and his numbers among non-white evangelicals are absolutely dismal. 
If you are an evangelical Christian and you have reservations about Donald Trump, I can respect that. But there will be other names on the ballot and you do not have to vote for Hillary Clinton. As I have said before, a vote for Hillary Clinton is an act of unmitigated wickedness. 
Hillary Clinton has made support for abortion one of the central pillars of her long political career. In fact, I dont know if there is any politician in America that is more associated with abortion than Hillary Clinton. Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, more than 58 million babies have been murdered in the United States, and Hillary Clintons hands are drenched with their blood. 
If you vote for Hillary Clinton, your hands will be drenched with their blood too. 
Needless to say, I am absolutely horrified that so many prominent evangelical leaders have come out in support of Hillary Clinton during this election season. For example, a group that represents over 6,000 Latino evangelical churches has just announced that they are endorsing Hillary Clinton ＃ 
An organization representing more than 6,000 Latino evangelical churches in the U.S. is endorsing Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. 
In a statement Thursday, the group OPEN USA says Clinton has proven her willingness to engage in difficult conversations, listen to contrasting opinions and engage faith leaders. 
Meanwhile, 75 evangelical leaders recently signed a petition on Change.org that strongly denounces Donald Trump＃ 
We, undersigned evangelicals, simply will not tolerate the racial, religious, and gender bigotry that Donald Trump has consistently and deliberately fueled, no matter how else we choose to vote or not to vote. 
One of the truly alarming trends that we have been seeing this election season is the number of prominent women in the evangelical movement that are openly rejecting Donald Trump and embracing Hillary Clinton. The following is a short excerpt from a recent Washington Post article that examined this phenomenon＃ 
When Jen Hatmaker speaks to stadiums full of Christian women, she regales them with stories about her five children and her garden back in Austin, Tex. 〞 and stays away from politics. But recently she took to Facebook and Instagram to blast Donald J. Trump as a national disgrace, and remind her legions of followers that there are other names on the ballot in November. 
And Christianity Today recently published an editorial from one of the top female evangelical leaders in the entire country in which she publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton. According to Christianity Today, Deborah Fikes is the former Permanent Representative to the United Nations for World Evangelical Alliance, which represents a constituency of 650 million with alliance offices in 129 countries. Fikes says that she stepped down from some of her leadership positions so that she could openly advocate for Clinton ＃ My recent resignations from evangelical leadership positions to endorse Hillary Clinton speaks volumes of how important I believe it is that she is elected in November. The toxic tone and atmosphere that surrounds Mr. Trump and is fueled among his supporters has done irreparable damage to not only our country and the future of the GOP but also to the public witness of evangelicals in America who are seen as some of his biggest supporters. There is no question in my mind or spirit that with the overwhelming challenges the next American president will face, Hillary Clinton is the most qualified person who has ever run for the Oval Office . On the issues of our national security, economic stability, seeing that healthcare reform continues to move forward, and tackling domestic challenges of poverty, inequality, and racism, we need her to be the person occupying this office. 
A lot of these women seem to think that abortion shouldnt be a major issue in this election, but that is like saying that the Holocaust shouldnt have been a major issue in Nazi Germany. 
Look, you dont have to vote for Donald Trump or anyone else to be a good Christian. 
But if you cast a vote for Hillary Clinton, you are casting a vote for the most evil, wicked and corrupt politician that this nation has possibly ever seen, and you are publicly endorsing the sinful positions that she is proud to stand for. 
I know that I have been writing about the election a lot lately , but I feel that it is very important that I do so. Most of the media coverage has focused on Donald Trump , but I feel that this election is far more about Hillary Clinton. The things that her and her husband have done have been well documented, and if the American people willingly choose her they will know exactly what they are doing. 
Unfortunately, not even Christians are standing united against the Clintons. The political divide in the evangelical Christian world has grown so deep that it has even reached Liberty University. The following comes from the Atlantic ＃ 
Thats why it was such a big deal when, two weeks ago, a group of Liberty students put out a letter explaining why theyre standing against the Republican presidential nominee. Jerry Falwell Jr., who has run the school since his father died in 2007, announced his support for Donald Trump back in January, and he has since spoken on the candidates behalf in interviews and at events. We are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwells endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history, the students wrote. Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him. 
Thousands of people signed onto the letter, including, the students said, roughly 2,000 students or alumni with liberty.edu email addresses.Dustin Wahl and Alex Forbes, two of the letters authors, were featured on MSNBC and CNN. They said they received supportive emails and tweets from Russell Moore, the head of the political arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, and Erick Erickson, the conservative radio-show host. 
And the support for Clinton is particularly strong among young adult evangelicals. When I read the following paragraph on the website of the New York Times , I was absolutely astounded＃ 
Kate Shellnutt, 30, the online editor of Christianity Today and editor of the CT Women section, said she had observed that the millennial generation has a lot less patience for Trump. Of the 33 influential millennial evangelicals she profiled for a cover story two years ago, she says she can now find only one, Lila Rose, who is pro-Trump, and even she has been publicly critical of him . Several have been using the hashtag #NeverTrump, Ms. Shellnutt said. 
The frightening thing is that this election might be the last chance for evangelical Christians to shape the political direction of this nation, because the truth is that demographics are rapidly shifting, and this includes the demographics of the evangelical community ＃ 
As Robert Jones has expertly documented in his recent book The End of White Christian America , the number of older, conservative, white male evangelicals is shrinking each year. Meanwhile, the number of younger evangelicals of all ethnic backgrounds 〞 whose moral and political views extend far beyond positions on gay marriage and abortion 〞 is on the rise. 
If you follow my work regularly, then you already know that I have very little hope for the future of America. 
But if Hillary Clinton is elected, there will be exactly zero hope. 
If evangelical Christians stood united, they could stop her, but at this point it appears that is not going to happen.

Just when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a game changer into the mix . On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clintons mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails did not come from her private server, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry, and according to some reports there may be potentially thousands of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? 
Lets take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ 
After recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that appear to be pertinent to the email probe. 
In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation, Comey wrote the chairmen. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. 
At this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clintons closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clintons Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ 
We dont know what this means yet except that its a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So thats where we are＃ 
Is it a certainty that we wont learn before the election? Im not sure its a certainty we wont learn before the election. 
One thing is, its possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ 
If the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? 
It is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. 
So those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. 
But if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ 
If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 
DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. 
But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. 
It would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. 
In such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be fair until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. 
Meanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. 
And CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ 
An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. 
MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. 
The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. 
Without Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. 
So if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. 
At this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.

Decade-old audio exposes then-Senator Hillary Clinton saying the US should have manipulated Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 to prevent a Hamas victory. The presidential candidate lamented that the US didnt determine who was going to win. 
I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake, then-New York Senator Clinton told the Jewish Press, a New York-based weekly newspaper, several months after the January election. 
And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win, she said. 
Until Friday, the comment Clinton made on September 5, 2006, only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist Eli Chomsky. An editor and a staff writer for the Jewish Press, he interviewed Clinton at the newspapers office in Brooklyn. 
Chomsky, who shared and played the tape for the Observer, says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with Clinton, during which the Palestinian parliamentary election was among primary topics. The comments have been posted on SoundCloud. 
Speaking to the news portal, he recalled being confused by the fact that anyone could support the idea 〞 offered by a national political leader, no less 〞 that the US should be in the business of fixing foreign elections. 2006 audio emerges of Clinton proposing election rigging in Palestine; censored by Israeli press for past 10 years https://t.co/LsMYcUzJR4 
〞 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 28, 2016 
The interview took place nine months after the Hamas movement claimed 76 of the 132 parliamentary seats, pushing aside the US-favored Fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet. That victory was neither welcomed in Israel, nor in the US. In Washington, where Hamas is considered a terrorist organization, officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a Palestinian Authority that included Hamas. 
Then-President George W. Bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the power of democracy, but refused to deal with Hamas as long as it opposed Israels existence and espoused violence. 
That day in September 2006, Clinton made odd and controversial comments, all now saved on the 45-minute record that Chomsky held onto all these years. 
I went to my bosses at the time, Chomsky told the Observer. The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody 〞 even a direct quote from anyone 〞 in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didnt think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years. Don't forget to follow the D.C. Clothesline on Facebook and Twitter.

Congress overwhelmingly voted for the Patriot Act nearly 16 years ago, and our civil liberties have never been the same since. As if this singular bill, passed by George W. Bush, wasnt invasive enough, allowing big banks to demand our internet data, and more 〞 the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act ( CISA ) makes cyber-spying by the shadow government and the financial entities controlling it, a forgone conclusion. 
As with most shadow government legislation, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act is packed with hidden surveillance allowances. CISA was quietly passed to allow government to demand that private companies hand over personal information to them at will. It also allows companies to mine data, under the auspices of government-created urgency. 
The mere fact that this act passed in late 2015 is monumental, since it has been before Congress in different forms for over a decade . The election seems to have offered the perfect cover, as Americans and activists were too busy arguing over Trump vs. Hillary. 
Scott Talbott, senior vice president of government relations at the Electronic Transactions Association believes the value of sharing our personal data as a means to be alerted of ＆cyber threats outweighs any hazard to our civil liberties. Talbott states , 
The value is that everyone can be alerted to cyber threats and take precautionary countermeasures before they materialize and spread, he said. Before CISA, corrective measures could be taken only after the cyber threat had done its damage. CISA allows each company to serve as an early warning system to the entire economy. 
Who exactly would be determining if someone is a ＆threat is the meat of the sandwich, though. CISA is ripe for abuse, just as the Patriot Act has been. 
The Patriot Act has made it legal for law enforcement to spy on people, without probable cause  to enter their homes, or even to strip search them before theyve been to court, had the opportunity to argue a case, or given ＆authorities a motive for this type of interrogation. 
The stated purpose of the Patriot Act was to deter terrorist acts in the United States, but what do you do when the terrorists have already taken over your country? CISA simply expands the reach of a shadow government which has already been proven to reach beyond the boundaries of constitutional law. 
More importantly, who specifically is CISA targeting? After multiple hack-ers have in-filt-rated com-puter sys-tems at the White House , the State De-part-ment , the Pentagon , and the Of-fice of Per-son-nel Man-age-ment, along with the Democratic National Committee , and numerous multinational banks run by the cabal, is the shadow government simply trying to create a stop-gap before their most elusive, yet damning information is made public? 
CISA certainly will expand the reach of government surveillance on citizens as it has been conducted by the the National Security Agency (NSA) before former NSA contractor Edward Snowden exposed it. 
I think this bill was meant to be a surveillance bill from the start, said Justin Harvey, CSO of Fidelis Cybersecurity, adding that he is dubious that the stated intent of the bill  to use collective intelligence to warn of potential cyber attacks and possibly stop them before they occur  will result. 
Under the guise of ＆sharing cyber threats CISA allows companies to wholesale-collect information that may not even be a threat  and then pass it along for government bodies to determine if it is, indeed a threat. If this sounds like circular logic  it is just the beginning of the odd verbiage within the bill. Its justifications for entering every possible orifice for data-gathering are more confounded than an octopus in a straight jacket. 
The government can already enter your personal property including your home, your body , your cell, and your computer , but now they will have a legal in-roads to declare you a cyber-threat, simply for sending an email . This begs the question  who is the real cyber-bully? CISA seems to be nothing more than a prevarication, covering the acts of an elite few who dont want their secrets exposed.

Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. Her conversation was secretly recorded. 
The audio was never released, and according to Chomsky it has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. He claims his copy is the only copy and no one has heard it since 2006. He gave a copy of the audio to the Observer. During the recording, Hillary is allegedly heard about rigging the election. She says: I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. It shows she is willing to do whatever it takes to win. 
Chomsky told the Observer he was taken aback that anyone could support the idea  offered by a national political leader, no less  that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections. The Observer is owned by Donald Trumps son in law.

Griffee / November 2, 2016 / DML REPORT / With only 6 days left before election day, Dennis Michael Lynch takes an electoral college map and shows how additional states will turn RED and get Trump over 270 electoral college votes to WIN the presidency. 
Taking states that the media has tried to downplay as if Trump has no chance to win them, DML shows how Trump not only has a chance, but predicts he WILL WIN these states, and he backs up his prediction with solid data and facts. 
DML also clarified that the polls are extremely misleading. He said Trump has lit a spark in people who have not voted in decades  some who have never voted  but now they are embracing Trump. These people are not being included in the polls. 
Early voting is also not a true representation of whats about to happen, because more Democrats tend to show up for early voting, while the majority of Republicans wait until election day. 
WATCH THIS EYE-OPENING VIDEO for a critical state-by-state analysis that proves Trump can easily win the election  then SHARE IT EVERYWHERE! 
**Note: In the video when DML talks about PA voting for Trump, he forgot to mention 100k Democrats in PA switched parties over the past year. In addition, PA saw an eye-popping number of new voters register as Republicans. Combined, PA in this election has 240,000 more Republicans than it did in 2012.

Illegal aliens are flooding through the border at an unprecedented pace. According to Border Patrol agents the surge is taking place because human smugglers are issuing warning that its now or never to get into the U.S. 
If Trump wins, the illegal aliens are told there will be a giant wall keeping them out of the U.S. permanently. If Clinton wins, they are led to believe amnesty will be granted. Both incentives are driving the illegal entries to a level not seen in years, and according to agents in Texas, the Border Patrol is overwhelmed with 1,000 apprehensions per night in just one sector. 
According to the Department of Homeland Security, in fiscal 2016, the Border Patrol apprehended 117,200 immigrants from Central America, almost one-third of all apprehensions border-wide 〞 and 5,000 more than during the so-called surge of 2014. The agency also apprehended 5,000 Haitians, up from just 700 last year. The number of immigrants claiming to be from Africa and Asia also is up. 

When you stop somebody, you ask their name and the first thing they tell you is  ＆Im here for asylum, I cant go home because theyll kill me. ＃ When it takes a good five or six minutes just to get their name out of them, they have a rehearsed story, said Chris Cabrera, a representative from the Border Patrol Council told Fox News. Once they get those papers saying they can pass through our checkpoint, well never see them again. 
Typically, an illegal immigrant pays a $4,000 to $6,000 smuggling fee to the drug cartels. Once here, he said the Mexican government had given each a number based on their arrival.

For weeks now all that has been posted with regards to the Presidential election is the lead that Hillary Clinton holds against Republican challenger Donald Trump. The mainstream press leads each day with an article or two on how Donald Trump has no electoral path to the White House. Could the political predictors working for the major networks and newspapers all be wrong? 
Yes, they are completely wrong, and wrong based on a basic and simple fact not being factored into their forgone conclusion. The fact being ignored is Donald Trump is winning the battle fought on the social media battleground. When 
Analyzed properly, it is clear that Donald Trump is getting all the attention on Facebook. Granted about half the comments he receives are positive, but Hillary Clinton's comments are almost entirely on the negative end of the commentary spectrum. 
Based on a thorough analysis of the Facebook chatter, it is predicted that Donald Trump will win 42 of the 50 states, including New York. This outcome is not only a landslide but an outright slaughter. Also understand that much of this data has been accrued before Hillary Clinton's current issues surfacing such as the Project Veritas Videos showing the DNC cheating machine in motion, the Wiki-leaks revelations, and the FBI reopening of the investigation of Hillary Clinton passing classified information on her private email server. All these scandals combined will only further erode any support she might find among the truly undecided . 
Another factor not being widely explained is that many of the polls affording Hillary Clinton her huge lead are also over sampling both Democrats and Independents. It is also not clear with regards to the learning of the Independents which is more likely than not, left of center. It will take a lot of dead voters and stuffed ballot boxes to bring Hillary Clinton close to the victory predicted by the mainstream media.

Throughout this election, Hillary Clinton has been claiming to be a warrior for women who will do everything in her power to help victims of sexual assault. Thats why it came as bad news to her when the video above this story surfaced＃ 
Infowars reported that the video shows child rape victim Kathy Shelton explain how Clinton allowed her rapist to go free when she was his defense lawyer, even thought she knew he was guilty. Afterwards, Clinton was caught on a recording laughing about the fact that shed just knowingly set a child rapist free. 
He took a lie detector test, Clinton said on the recording, according to The American Thinker. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs (laughs).

Positive Trump polls are coming all the time, so its all hands on deck from the Democrats to do whatever it takes to hand the election to Hillary. Obamas latest move involves registering immigrant voters who will most likely be voting for Hillary in November and hes spent TONS of your taxpayer money doing it. From Judicial Watch : Months after the Obama administration spent $19 million to register new immigrant voters that will likely support Democrats in November, its dedicating an additional $10 million in a final push as the presidential election approaches. The money is distributed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Homeland Security agency that oversees lawful immigration, to organizations that help enhance pathways to naturalization by offering immigrants free citizenship instruction, English, U.S. history and civics courses. Officially, theyre known as citizenship integration grants.[＃] Judicial Watch went on to say＃ The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been aggressive in promoting its citizen integration grant program this year, offering large sums to recruit new groups that can offer immigrants the services they need to become citizens. Clearly, the ultimate goal is qualifying as many immigrants as possible to vote since they tend to cast ballots for Democrats. We intend to award about $1 million to first-time recipients in the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program for fiscal year 2016, the agencys grant announcement states. If you represent one of these organizations, or know of an interested organization, we strongly encourage that organization to consider applying. Additionally, another $9 million will fund programs that provide both citizenship instruction and instruction and naturalization application services. Some might consider this a cash giveaway.[＃] Practically every federal agency is participating in the effort by contributing resources and creating programs to help immigrants. For example the Department of Labor (DOL) is implementing new workforce programs for the new Americans and the Department of Education is promoting funding opportunities to assure that the immigrants are provided the tools they need to succeed. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is collaborating with other agencies to release a career and credentialing toolkit on immigrant-focused career-pathways programs. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and USCIS are making sure the new Americans have worker rights and protections and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is launching a two-year pilot to assure that non English speakers have meaningful access to housing programs subsidized by American taxpayers. Obama likes to pretend that hes doing this for the greater good of America, but the truth is its just part of the overall agenda to do whatever it takes to make sure Democrats run Washington and continue to drive our country into the ground.

We have yet another scandal and reason to distrust Obama and Hillary Clinton〞just for you. President Obamas Justice Department has been caught red handed stealing money, which should be going to victims of crimes, and putting it into the hands of left-wing advocacy groups, as per Breitbart . This new scandal comes after we saw Hillary Clinton cleared of charges for acid washing her emails. This clearance came from the Justice Department, as run by a person who had private meetings with Bill Clinton prior to the decision. This also happened after Hillary Clinton said that if she was elected, she would reappoint the current attorney general〞that same person〞Loretta Lynch. The key facts of this news scandal are as follows: the Justice Department has millions of dollars of taxpayer money that is usually reserved for the victims of serious crimes. However, Obama has been funneling money, in the ballpark of $650 million, away from victims of serious crimes and towards organizations that are helping him. This money is supposed to be going to victims of federal crimes like gang violence, wall street corruption, or other white collar crimes. Its normally used for restitution of the money the victims lost as a result of criminal actions. Is it surprising Obama thinks this money should be lining his pockets instead? Obama and his cronies find ways to make these left wing advocacy groups victims of crimes. These are organizations are signing people up to vote, going to rallies, knocking on doors, and helping elect Hillary Clinton〞not advocacy groups that need restitution of money lost to criminals. Obamas Justice Department has failed us once again. Instead of abusing taxpayer money, this Justice Department should be prosecuting Hillary Clinton for lying to Congress, destroying evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena, and obstructing justice. This is, alone, is enough to impeach the president, but we all know there simply isnt enough time left in his presidency to do so. But, maybe we could get the paperwork rolling just to scare him a little bit! If elected, it is clear Hillary Clinton will continue these corrupt practices, especially with Loretta Lynch as her attorney general. The Justice Department especially will remain a pay-to-getaway operation. Do you think Obamas scheme of funneling money is ethical?

Political activists discovered a hidden web site for WRCB out of Chattanooga, Tenn. showing election results with Hillary Clinton securing 343 electoral votes and 42% of the popular vote. The web site originated from the FTP server of WorldNow, a media software company that provides real-time data  such as election results  and other media assets to local news stations. The activist who found the page pointed out that the results align well with the fractional vote method used by voting machines to rig elections to a predetermined outcome. On election day, you will see the same percentages overall, with only the numbers that claim to equal them different, the activist reported. The difference in total votes shown on the station pages, with the same overall final percentages proves the election theft is automated to hit desired percentages, no one has to lift a finger during the election itself to accomplish the steal. Election fraud expert Bev Harris was the first to uncover this method, which is also known as vote shaving. You need to have votes counted as fractions, Harris said on The Alex Jones Show Monday. You need the votes to be counted with decimal places, like you count money. If a vote is a dollar, you also need to have cents with it. That will not show. Its hidden. Vote shaving works by treating votes as decimals rather than whole numbers, which allows the machines to allocate the remaining fractional percentages elsewhere to sway election outcomes. Theres this one central computer, which at the end of the day, all the votes come to it, Harris pointed out. Thats where you take it. You dont run around to 5,000 different precincts. You wait until the votes come to you, and then you have your way with them. And, interestingly, it appears the majority of the local news stations get their election results from the same software company. Skeptics suggested the WorldNow page was part of a code test to ensure the software would post the actual results, but surprisingly, the data on the page was typed in  with no apparent code tabulating anything. And its revealing that, more often than not, when the mainstream media tests election result software, it shows the establishment candidate winning the election. At the very least, the results page shows obvious media bias towards Hillary, and it follows a pattern by the mainstream media to claim Hillary has already won the election weeks before Nov. 8 in an attempt to suppress voter enthusiasm for Trump, which is one of his major advantages. This discovery comes amid Project Veritas damning videos exposing Democrat operatives discussing how theyve been rigging elections for the last 50 years, as well as Wikileaks relentless data dumping of John Podestas emails revealing more collusion and corruption between the Clinton campaign and the mainstream media. WRCB could not be immediately reached for comment.

Every man and woman for themselves! This ship is going down! That is just a snippet of what we imagine to be the conversations happening all around the nation within the offices of DNC members. The DNC and Hillary are certainly no strangers to scandal at this point. These days, news reporters can barely keep up with crimes of the Democrats. The party is reaching new lows, practically pushing each other out of the way to commit fraud and lie to the voters. Meanwhile, continuing to try and only show the world what the Republicans are supposedly doing wrong. They would like Americans to believe that only the Republicans are guilty. There are many problems with this, beginning with all of the evidence available. Just a few days ago, the story broke that Democrats were returning contribution money. Returning money? Why on earth would they do that? It may have something to do with the fact that the tens of thousands of dollars from the personal injury lawyers of the Thornton Law Firm was money the partners received in illegal reimbursements. Campaign finance rules prohibit companies like Thornton from giving more than $2,700 to any singular candidate. Straw donor practices easily allow the firms to get around the rule. We wouldnt want laws to get in the way of lawyers and money. In Boston, it was uncovered that the law firm gave their partners bonuses the same day they donated to the campaignsin the same amounts. Dirty money given to dirty politicians from dirty lawyers. Perfect headline for Democrats. High profile Senators and candidates have rushed to donate the money they received to the Department of Treasury. This is a common method of dumping tainted money from a campaign. The Democrats involved in this scandal include: Florida Rep. Patrick Murphy Former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto Pennsylvania Senate hopeful Katie McGinty New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan Former Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold These candidates all have something very important in common: they are fighting for swing-state seats in Senate races. If wrongdoing stopped there, it would be more than enough to disqualify these people when you go to cast your vote. It did not; it went much further. Already these unethical donations made the small Thornton firm, which boasts just ten partners, one of the countrys largest dollar for dollar political donors. It turns out this is not the first time that this particular law firm helped out Democrats. The Boston Globe revealed that between 2010 and 2014, three of the firms partners gave $1.6M to mostly Democratic candidates. During that same period of time, those same three partners received $1.4M in bonuses from the law firm, in what appears to be reimbursement for their hefty donations. As this story broke, it encouraged other people to come forward and admit their involvement. Viveca Novak, who reported the story for the Center for Responsive Politics, told FOXBusiness.com: 
This may not be an isolated case and is likely not the only one of employees being reimbursed for contributions to candidates. Weve received emails since the story was published that employees at other companies were pressured to make donations and were told theyd be reimbursed. We always thought it was a much bigger problem, but it is hard to flush out. So here we are with Democrats promptly abandoning ship and handing the money over to the Treasury. Not all of the Democrats, though. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, and best friend to Hillary Clinton, is standing strong and defending her actions. She says she will not return the money until it is proven to be illegal. This is the same Senator who has spent her career sitting on the high horse of condemning hidden money in politics. Elizabeth Warrens hypocrisy aside, this is a very serious situation. Lawyers representing public interest from The Campaign Legal Center have filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission. This is certainly just the beginning of uncovering the truth of the Democrats campaign practices. The problem we are currently faced with is that the election is 5 days away. Judith Ingram of the Federal Election Commission told reporters that there is a lengthy process to review these complaints for merit and next steps. A complete investigation is exactly what we want and need. It will hopefully continue until they have discovered the whole truth. The election though, is next week. We dont have time. The Democrats in battleground states have been using filthy money to fund their campaigns. There is absolutely no way to know that this money hasnt swayed the election in their favor. Voters in these states need to be aware. They must know the truth before they walk into the voting booth. Information in this election is crucial because the Democrats have done such a good job at muddying the waters around the real issues. There is no telling how deep this goes. As of today, we absolutely have enough information to know a few very important facts: The Democratic party as a whole, cannot be trusted to tell the truth . The money that their campaigns use is not all from legal contributions . The only way to send them a clear message that we will not condone their actions: vote Republican. We need Donald Trump now more than ever. Corruption in politics has gotten so bad that many people dont even bat an eye when we see shocking revelations like this one. On November 8th, we have the opportunity to drain the swamp and root out all of this corruption. We have been given an opportunity, we should take advantage of it!

Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. 
Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News ＃ 
Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. 
The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. 
If anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election, then they arent paying much attention, Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. 
And without a doubt, voting locations are soft targets that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters ＃ 
There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didnt have 15 or 20 years ago, said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee.  What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then thats certainly concerning. 
All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. 
Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. 
Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania ＃ 
We dont want to lose an election because you know what Im talking about, Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. Because you know what? Thats a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places . 
And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats＃ 
Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. 
Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. 
I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent, Moynihan said. You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat. 
In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . 
Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation ＃ 
According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. 
The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation  apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007  when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? 
Either way, it doesnt look good. 
After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. 
But Democrats dont like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters＃ 
Its un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that , Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book  Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America , previously told The Christian Science Monitor. Voting was very, very dangerous. I dont think anyones suggesting that were at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic. 
Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. 
But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? 
If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed.

What happens when you get thousands of lawyers involved in the craziest election in modern American history? Unfortunately, we may be about to find out. We all remember the legal tug of war between Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000, and with each passing day it is becoming more likely that we could see something similar (or even worse) in 2016. In a brand new article entitled  Clinton, Trump Prepare for Possibility of Election Overtime , Bloomberg discusses the armies of lawyers that Clinton and Trump are both assembling for this election. It would be nice if it was the American people that actually decided the outcome of this election, but if things are very close on November 8th it may come down to what the courts decide. 
Traditionally, there has been a lot of pressure on the losing candidate to concede to the winning candidate before election night is over. 
However, in recent elections this has begun to change. I already mentioned what took place in the aftermath of the 2000 election, and in 2004 John Kerry did not concede to George W. Bush until the next morning. 
And looking back at the numbers from the 2012 election, it is clear that Mitt Romney should not have conceded the race to Barack Obama so early. There was evidence of election fraud in key battleground states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado and Virginia , and many people out there still believe that Mitt Romney would have won if the election would have been conducted fairly. 
So when Donald Trump says that he may not immediately concede the election if the results are tight, I think that there is wisdom in that. 
A couple of weeks ago, it looked like we may have had a situation where Hillary Clinton could have won by a landslide . But the FBI changed everything when they announced that they were renewing their investigation into Hillary Clintons emails. Since that announcement, the poll numbers have been rapidly shifting and now Trump has all of the momentum . 
For example, the ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll had Hillary Clinton up by double digits not too long ago, but now it is showing a one point lead for Trump . 
The race is very close at this point, and if the race to 270 electoral votes is razor tight on election night, I dont anticipate that either candidate will be eager to concede. We could see a prolonged legal battle ensue, and that could mean that we dont have a new president until long after election day is over. 
Already, both campaigns are assembling large armies of lawyers. In fact, Bloomberg is reporting that Clinton already has thousands of lawyers that have donated their time to her campaign＃ 
Clinton is assembling a voter protection program that has drawn thousands of lawyers agreeing to lend their time and expertise in battleground states, though the campaign isnt saying exactly how many or where. It is readying election observers in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada and Arizona to assess any concerns 〞 including the potential for voter intimidation 〞 and to verify normal procedures. 
The Republican National Lawyers Association, which trains attorneys in battleground states and in local jurisdictions where races are expected to be close, aims to assemble 1,000 lawyers ready to monitor polls and possibly challenge election results across the country. Hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, one of Trumps biggest backers, has sunk $500,000 into the group, its biggest donation in at least four presidential elections, Internal Revenue Service filings show. 
And most Americans dont realize this, but Reuters is reporting that the Democrats have already filed election-related lawsuits in four key swing states＃ 
Democratic Party officials sued Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in four battleground states on Monday, seeking to shut down a poll-watching effort they said was designed to harass minority voters in the Nov. 8 election . 
In lawsuits filed in federal courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona and Ohio, Democrats argued that Trump and Republican Party officials were mounting a campaign of vigilante voter intimidation that violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and an 1871 law aimed at the Ku Klux Klan. 
Meanwhile, the legal challenges for the Clinton campaign continue to mount. The renewed investigation into Hillary Clintons mishandling of classified documents is just one of five FBI investigations that are currently looking into the conduct of Clintons inner circle ＃ 
There are, in fact, not one but five separate FBI investigations which involve members of Clintons inner circle or their closest relatives  the people at the center of what has come to be known as Clintonworld. 
The five known investigations are into: Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedins estranged husband sexting a 15-year-old; the handling of classified material by Clinton and her staff on her private email server; questions over whether the Clinton Foundation was used as a front for influence-peddling; whether the Virginia governor broke laws about foreign donations; and whether Hillarys campaign chairmans brother did the same. 
Despite everything that we already know about Hillary, about half the country still plans to vote for her. 
If the American people willingly choose to elect the most corrupt presidential candidate in our history, it may be a sign that the events that I talk about in my new book are a lot closer than many people had originally been anticipating. 
But the good news is that a Clinton victory is looking a whole lot less likely than it was just a week or two ago. 
Could it be possible that the FBI has just delivered the  miracle  that Donald Trump desperately needed? 
Americans are more emotionally invested in this presidential campaign than they have been in any presidential campaign since at least 1980. Many of those that are backing Trump will be emotionally devastated if he does not win on November 8th, but if Trump does win we are likely to see the radical left throw a political temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. 
Earlier today, I shared with my readers the amazing fact that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old during his first full day in the White House if he wins the election. 
Many conservatives are fully convinced that it is Donald Trumps destiny to be president. 
Personally, I do not know what is going to happen. But with a race this close, it may be the courts that end up deciding who our next president is, and that is an outcome that none of us should want to see.

On November 14th, something extraordinary is going to happen. On that date we will witness the closest full moon that we have seen since 1948. Known as a supermoon, this full moon will happen just six days after the U.S. presidential election. If you look up into the night sky on November 14th, you will notice that the moon appears to be much bigger and much brighter than usual.   there is some special meaning to the biggest supermoon in almost 70 years? The last time we witnessed a supermoon of this size Israel become a nation, and as you will see below, many believe that the last couple months of 2016 could have historic significance for the Jewish people as well. 
Do you remember ever seeing the moon so big in the sky that you felt that you could almost reach up and grab it? Well, on the 14th you may feel that way again. According to CNN , supermoons typically appear to be 14% bigger and 30% brighter than other full moons. 
And without a doubt, what we are about to witness is an extremely rare event. The last time that a supermoon was this close to our planet was in 1948, and it wont happen again until 2034 ＃ 
The November full moon is not only the closest full moon of 2016, NASA said , but also the closest full moon since 1948 (which is still the last time the Cleveland Indians won the World Series). 
This is one you might want to watch out for: The full moon wont come this close to Earth again until Nov. 25, 2034, NASA says. 
But even though this is a highly unusual event, does that mean that it must have some sort of a special meaning? 
Of course not, and the truth is that I dont know if this giant supermoon holds any special significance. 
However, before we dismiss this phenomenon completely, lets remember what the Bible has to say. In the Scriptures, we are told that God intended the moon to serve as a sign from the very beginning. The following is what Genesis 1:14 says in the Modern English Version ＃ 
And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be signs to indicate seasons, and days, and years. 
And Jesus told us that there would be signs in the sun and the moon just prior to His return. The following is what Luke 21:25-26 says in the Modern English Version ＃ 
25  There will be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars ; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring; 26 men fainting from fear and expectation of what is coming on the inhabited earth. For the powers of heaven will be shaken. 
So clearly the Bible tells us that the moon can serve as a sign. 
But is that happening in this case? 
I dont know, but just like as in 1948, it appears that something very significant may be about to happen concerning the nation of Israel. 
Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal published an article entitled  Obamas Israel Surprise?  which warned that Barack Obama may try to force a diplomatic resolution for Israel and the Palestinians at the United Nations before the end of his term. 
The options that Obama is reportedly considering include a resolution formally recognizing a Palestinian state. The following comes from CNS News ＃ 
The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that according to administration sources, the White House has asked the State Department to develop an options menu for the presidents final weeks. 
It said the possibilities could include supporting  or not vetoing  a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements; or a resolution formally recognizing a Palestinian state, or setting parameters for a final settlement of the long dispute. 
If you follow The Most Important News on a regular basis, then you already know that I have been warning about this over and over and over again in recent months. Barack Obama knows that this is his last chance to leave a legacy in the Middle East, and at this point the only chance that he has to get something accomplished is at the United Nations. 
Obamas last day in office is scheduled to be January 20th, and so he is up against a deadline. Prior to the election he was likely extremely hesitant to make a move because he didnt want to mess up Hillary Clintons chances, but after the election there wont be anything holding him back. 
Perhaps that is why the Obama administration recently told the Palestinians to wait until after the election for something to get done at the UN＃ 
On the surface, the latest message to the Palestinian Authority from the Obama administration is no different from the past two decades of American policy: the U.S. will veto any resolution attacking Israel or demanding Palestinian independence without them first making peace with the Jewish state. But, as Haaretz reported , there was one significant caveat to the warning. They were told not to push for any such resolution until after the presidential election next month . 
The rest of the UN Security Council has been ready to pass a resolution formally establishing a Palestinian state for a long time. The only thing holding it back has been the U.S. veto power. 
So right now the fate of the land of Israel is in Barack Obamas hands, and he only has until January 20th to make his final decision. 
If we do see the land of Israel divided at the United Nations, so many of the things   going to start happening in rapid succession. When we divide their land, our land will be divided as well, and so let us hope that nothing happens at the UN Security Council before the end of Obamas term. 
We truly do live in ominous times, and the events of the next several weeks are going to tell us a lot. 
I have a feeling that this election is not going to end well, and we also need to keep a close eye on the UN Security Council. 
I have previously described the period of time leading up to January 20th as the danger zone, and so much could potentially go wrong during this period of time. 
And we certainly wont have long to wait to get an indication of where things are heading. Next Tuesday the American people will face their final exam, and let us hope that they do not pick Hillary Clinton, because such a choice would have disastrous consequences for all of us.

By Michael Snyder, on November 16th, 2016 
The 2016 election will be remembered as perhaps the most contentious election in modern American history, and things often got extremely angry and bitter on a personal level. If you spend much time on Facebook or Twitter you know exactly what I am talking about. The vitriol on social media has been off the charts, and there are some people that are actually unfriending anyone that supported the candidate that they were against. This election has also torn apart families, friends and even entire churches. Relationships that took decades to build in some cases are now permanently shattered because of fighting over Trump and Clinton. 
Personally, I couldnt imagine choosing never to talk to a family member or a close friend ever again because of a political disagreement. Trump and Clinton are only temporary, but your family will always be your family. Sadly, we live in a nation where strife, discord, bitterness and resentment are all running rampant, and unforgiveness has become a national pastime. 
As a nation, we are extremely divided. In fact, at this moment we are more divided than we have ever been in my entire lifetime. A house divided against itself will surely fall, and if we dont learn how to love one another I dont see any reason to be optimistic about the future of this country. 
If you are a Republican, can you honestly say that you love Democrats? 
If you are a Democrat, can you honestly say that you love Trump supporters? 
If this nation is ever going to heal, we have got to learn how to forgive, and we have got to learn how to love others that see things differently than we do. 
I know what many of you are thinking at this point. Many of you are wondering if I have gone soft, and many of you are wondering how we are supposed to forgive people that believe some of the most horrible things imaginable. 
I didnt say that it would be easy. 
And it is certainly not necessary to agree with someone or even acknowledge that their viewpoints are legitimate in order to love, forgive and value that person. 
Lets take abortion as an example. Most Democrats and many Republicans believe that we should continue to murder babies on an industrial scale in our abortion mills all over the country. In fact, many of them want to make it even easier and want to shower organizations such as Planned Parenthood with even more government money. 
This is evil on a level that is difficult to put into words, and what we are doing to those precious little children is on par with what the Nazis did to Jewish people and other minorities in their concentration camps during World War II. And if we do not stop slaughtering babies, the judgment of God is going to absolutely devastate this nation. 
According to Gallup, 79 percent of all Americans believe that abortion should be legal under at least some circumstances, and so unfortunately that is not likely to happen any time soon. 
But just because someone believes in killing babies does not mean that we should hate that person. 
On the contrary, every single individual is of immense value. Whenever you are tempted to hate someone, just remember that Jesus valued that person so much that He was willing to go to the cross to pay for that persons sins. No matter what someone looks like, no matter where someone is from, and no matter how much money they have, each and every person is greatly loved in the Fathers eyes, and we are commanded to love them too. 
We are to love all people at all times and in all ways. Christian maturity is far more about how much you love than it is about how much you know. Unfortunately, most people dont seem to understand this simple truth. 
These days a lot of people are running around touting how self-righteous they are, but most of those same people seem to be quite lacking in real love. 
If you really want to be someone that keeps the commandments, you should start by getting your heart right. In Matthew 22, Jesus told us which commandments are the most important of all. The following is what Matthew 22:36-40 says in the Modern English Version ＃ 
36 Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law ? 
37 Jesus said to him,  ＆ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind . 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ＆ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . 40 On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets. 
We should all constantly endeavor to become people of great love. 
Once again, that does not mean that you have to accept or approve of what others are saying or doing. In fact, often the loving thing is to point out that someone you love is being destructive to themselves or others. 
And as a nation, we are being self-destructive on a scale that is almost unimaginable. We are literally committing national suicide, and until we start radically changing our behavior it isnt going to matter much who is in the White House. 
If you want to get your heart right on a personal level, a good place to start is by forgiving those that have hurt you or offended you. And that would include our politicians. I am certainly not saying that you should vote for anyone that stands for positions that are extremely offensive, but we can definitely forgive them and pray for them. 
In addition, if you have had relationships that have been broken during this election season, perhaps now is a good time to reach out in a spirit of love and forgiveness. 
Life is too short to go around holding grudges, and those that choose to forgive often find that they are the ones that are truly being set free.",english,2016-11-17T13:22:31.596+02:00,endoftheamericandream.com,US,,"Re: Now That The Election Is Over, Will Republicans And Democrats Learn How To Love One Another?",0,http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Arguing-Public-Domain-460x325.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Megyn Kelly will co-host Live with Kelly alongside Kelly Ripa on the morning after the presidential election, Nov. 9. Its anyones guess what the Nov. 9 timing means.
The Fox News host of the The Kelly File will join Ripa much like Anderson Cooper, Seth Meyers and others have been doing as co-hosts since Michael Strahan left the show for a new role on Good Morning America, according to People magazine on Wednesday.
Actress Naomi Watts and actor Michael Ealy are also scheduled to appear that day.
The Wrap noted that Kellys co-hosting gig comes as speculation continues to swirl about her next move as her Fox News contract expires in 2017.
Live with Kelly which is nationally syndicated by Disney/ABC Home Entertainment and TV Distribution, noted People.
Cue up speculation that Kelly is flirting with ABC News  ＆Live with Kelly being syndicated by ABC-parent Disney, and a timeslot competitor to NBC News cash cow ＆Today show, said Lisa Moraes on Deadline.com.
In one of those incredible coincidences, word of the booking on the significant election-cycle morning broke the same day Fox News interim CEO Rupert Murdoch gave an interview to his newspaper Wall Street Journal, to publicly announce Kelly is important to the network and he hopes to get her under contract ＆very soon, while adding, ominously, ＆we have a deep bench of talent, many of whom would give their right arm for her timeslot.
CNN Worldwide chief Jeff Zucker praised Kelly earlier this month, calling her a tremendous news anchor but was coy in addressing her contract coming to an end at Fox News, according to Deadline.com, adding Ill leave it there.
Kelly and fellow Fox News host Sean Hannity had publicly feuded this month over the presidential election, according to the Washington Post, and she told Variety in April she was unsure whether she would resign with Fox News.
I really like my show, and I love my team, Kelly told Variety then. But you know, theres a lot of brain damage that comes from the job. There was probably less brain damage when I worked in the afternoon. I was less well known. I had far less conflict in my life.
I also have three kids who are soon going to be in school from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. I come to work at 3:30. I like to see my children. Having said that, my boss has been good about working with me to make me happy  he knows Im a hard worker. Ive had few problems here where I couldnt talk to him and say, ＆Can we work something out?, and come away happy, she added.

Decade-old audio exposes then-Senator Hillary Clinton saying the US should have manipulated Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 to prevent a Hamas victory. The presidential candidate lamented that the US didnt determine who was going to win.
I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake, then-New York Senator Clinton told the Jewish Press, a New York-based weekly newspaper, several months after the January election.
And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win, she said.
Until Friday, the comment Clinton made on September 5, 2006, only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist Eli Chomsky. An editor and a staff writer for the Jewish Press, he interviewed Clinton at the newspapers office in Brooklyn.

Chomsky, who shared and played the tape for the Observer, says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with Clinton, during which the Palestinian parliamentary election was among top topics. The comments have been posted on SoundCloud.
Speaking to the news portal, he recalled being confused by the fact that anyone could support the idea 〞 offered by a national political leader, no less 〞 that the US should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.
The interview took place nine months after the Hamas movement claimed 76 of the 132 parliamentary seats, pushing aside the US-favored Fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet. That victory was neither welcomed in Israel, nor in the US. In Washington, where Hamas is considered a terrorist organization, officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a Palestinian Authority that included Hamas.
Then-President George W. Bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the power of democracy, but refused to deal with Hamas as long as it opposed Israels existence and espoused violence.
That day in September 2006, Clinton made odd and controversial comments, all now saved on the 45-minute record that Chomsky held onto all these years.
I went to my bosses at the time, Chomsky told the Observer. The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody 〞 even a direct quote from anyone 〞 in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didnt think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.

Black Box Voting, founded in 2003, performs nonpartisan investigative reporting on elections in an attempt to stop vote rigging.
You may be wondering what the term black box means. A black box system is non-transparent; its functions are hidden from the public. Elections, of course, should not be black box systems.
Here is a link to a free copy of the book, Black Box Voting HERE .
Author Bev Harris became known for groundbreaking work on electronic voting machines, which can remove transparency of the vote count.
With voting machines, all political power can be converted to the hands of a few anonymous subcontractors:

A very sobering Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that the Federation has been officially notified by the United States North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) that their military forces are now on  Sustained Alert Status  due to unspecified threats directly related to their upcoming 8 November presidential election. [ Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, under the protocol and procedures outlined in the New Start Treaty that came into force on 5 February 2011 between the Federation and the United States, one of the obligations of the signing parties to reduce the risk of war is a notification process to take place when  aberrations/sudden changes  (departure from normal) are made〞and that occurred this past week when NORAD unexpectedly expanded its 17-21 October air defense exercises with Canada to now include the California region where just yesterday US warplanes conducted what they call  security exercises .
As to the Americans  explanation/reasons  for expanding the use of their warplanes over the continental United States (CONUS) with no foreign threat being known, this report explains, the Pentagon explained as being a  National Special Security Event  due to unspecified threats being posed to the national leadership of the US government and directly related to their presidential election.
Deputy Defense Minister Tatiana Shevtsova , however, and shockingly, writes in this report that the American government is currently undergoing a  silent coup  pitting forces loyal to President Obama against those aligned with Hillary Clinton〞who was the former disgraced US Secretary of State and is facing an estimated 20 year prison sentence for obstruction justice and who, also, is being  closed in upon  by Obamas Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) who have launched a staggering 5 different criminal investigations against her and everyone of her inner circle .
Deputy Minister Shevtsova further notes in this MoD report that the vast criminality of Hillary Clinton, and everyone associated with her, has been so exposed to the American public that President Obamas greatest fear now is that even if she were able to be elected, she could singlehandedly destroy the Democratic Party for decades to come〞an observation, curiously, supported by American experts who believe the same .
Equally to be as feared by the Obama regime as Hillary Clinton, this report continues, is her campaign chairman John Podesta who is described as being adept at earning extraordinary sums of money via selling out the American public , and who Wikileaks revealed yesterday gave the order to destroy all of Hillary Clintons emails that were under subpoena by the US Congress and that a US Federal Judge had, likewise, ordered to be returned to the US State Department.
With Londons Guardian News Service having gone through all of Podestas Wikileaks released emails , this report notes, even this far-leftist publication has been appalled at the level of corruption of Hillary Clinton and all who surround her〞and who wrote yesterday that the level of criminality surrounding Hillary Clinton  points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else .
As the six biggest US-based corporations supporting Hillary Clinton control some 90% of tens of thousands media outlets, including television channels, newspapers, magazines, radio stations and online editions (which means that the US media market is monopolized to a great extent and alternative outlets cannot be accessed in many towns), this report continues, the American people have awoken to the fact that their nation has fallen to 41 st out of 180 countries in the latest Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index to both their shame and amazement of what their criminal elites have done to them.
And in the American peoples  response/reaction  to the horrors that their Hillary Clinton supporting criminal elite class has put them through, this report notes, they are even now massively rejecting the manipulation of polling data designed to keep them from voting 〞and have, also, reacted in horror to YouTube, yesterday, censoring a Wall Street Journal video telling these people how they are being lied to and deceived.
With more empirical evidence showing Donald Trump is poised to win next weeks US presidential election in a landslide , and the Obama regime itself now turning against Hillary Clinton , this report grimly concludes, anyone believing that Hillary Clinton and her desperate criminal forces wont strike back to retake control of America would be gravely mistaken〞and the worst may be yet to come.

With fake polls running rampant everywhere, with Reuters/Ipsos just releasing yet another fake poll oversampling Democrats by 11% and including only Likely Voters, then showing the results with Hillary Clinton leading by 6%, we have decided to conduct our own poll.
Our poll is a fair and unbiased poll. We have included Twitter hashtags for #DonaldTrump and #HillaryClinton as well as #GaryJohnson and #JillStein. It will reach both sides, thus being fully fair and balanced. Our poll also includes 3rd party candidates Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Voters can only vote once in our poll and their vote cannot be changed.
Thanks to Wikileaks email ID 26551 we now have confirmed data of what we all have long suspected, that polling agencies are being ordered to oversample as much as needed in order to artificially inflate the numbers of a specific candidates which has enough power to pull the strings or is simply preferred by the polling agency.
Most mainstream media polls only include Likely Voters nowadays though it hasnt always been like this. According to their definition, Likely Voters means people who also voted in the previous elections. This is not an accurate way to measure the real preference out there because both Trump and Clinton benefit from what is known as first time voters. People who never voted before, people who feel disenfranchised by the system and who simply didnt want to vote before.
There is also the Millennial vote which is also impossible to include in the Likely Voters BS the media is pushing. Donald Trump is a revolutionary who vowed to change the system. This has brought millions of new people who never participated in the elections before. Bernie Sanders was also a revolutionary who vowed to do the exact same thing. Bernie lost or better said the election was stolen from him but thats another story. Bernie endorsed Hillary Clinton so, some of his voters have been transferred to Hillary Clinton now. Those first-time Bernie voters are also not included in the Likely Voters polls.
So without further due, we present to you our own OPEN POLL where everybody can vote only once. A fair an unbiased poll.
Who will you vote for in the upcoming US presidential election 2016? Note: There is a poll embedded within this post, please visit the site to participate in this post's poll.

What appears to be test pages for graphics clientele for news stations across the country could in fact turn out to be another Dewey wins moment or more recently, akin to the BBC reporting the collapse of building 7 on 911a? before it happened.
Election night results are big business. WorldNow.com, a 17 year old CMS and digital tech provider was recently publicly traded to San Francisco based messaging company Frankly for $45 million. SO it comes as no surprise that yet another facet of the election process is out of the oversight of citizens and in the greedy hands of the corporatocracy.
NBC affiliate WRCB TV in Chattanooga, Tennessee has inadvertently posted election night results. The results page appears to be similar to what mainstream news networks display on election night, including Presidential and Congressional results, the popular vote count, electoral votes, and percentage of precincts reporting.
As Jim Stone notes, the page was pulled directly from the WorldNow.com content management platform utilized by major networks like NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox and appears to be a non-public staging area for news and election results. The original page has since been reset.

In a video released by Project Veritas, James Oa?Keefe exposes what everyone except Democrats have known to be true. There is a lot of voter fraud.
In the video, NYC Democratic Commissioner of the Board of Elections Alan Schulkin is caught on hidden camera at a United Federation of Teachers holiday party admitting that there is widespread voter fraud in New York City.
a?Yeah, they should ask for your ID. I think there is a lot of voter fraud,a? said Schulkin, who elaborated on the types of voter fraud that are taking place in New York.
Voter fraud has been labeled as a right-wing myth by the left, but Schulkin, a Democrat, confirmed everyonea?s worst fears, going against the grain of his own party.
a?You know, I dona?t think ita?s too much to ask somebody to show some kind of an IDa?Like I say, people dona?t realize, certain neighborhoods in particular they bus people around to vote,a? said Schulkin.
When asked about which type of neighborhoods the busing of voters takes place in, Schulkin confirmed that it was minority neighborhoods, adding, a?they get busses and they move people around.a?
Schulkin expressed concern over voter fraud and suggested that Mayor Bill de Blasio was to blame for a lot of the voter fraud taking place in New York City.
a?He gave out ID cards. De Blasio. Thata?s in lieu of a drivera?s license, but you can use it for anything. But, they didna?t vet people to see who they really are. Anybody can go in there and say I am Joe Smith, I want an ID card. Ita?s absurd. Therea?s a lot of fraud. Not just voter fraud, all kinds of fraud.a?
Despite having disapproval with de Blasioa?s faulty ID program and widespread voter fraud, Schulkin also expressed concerns over safety in the polling locations as well as the potential for voter fraud, specifically with regards to Muslims wearing burkas.
a?They detonate bombs in the public schools, which we are using. That could disrupt the whole electiona?Your vote doesna?t even count, because they can go in there with a burka and you dona?t know if they are a voter.a?
It is clear after listening to a New York City Democratic Election Commissioner that the Democrats are in denial of the fraud that surrounds them. Schulkin confirms that voter ID laws are something that New York City desperately needs as a way to curb voter fraud.

Leaked funding documents reveal an effort by George Soros and his foundations to manipulate election laws and process rules ahead of the federal election far more expansively than has been previously reported.
The billionaire and convicted felon moved hundreds of millions of dollars into often-secret efforts to change election laws, fuel litigation to attack election integrity measures, push public narratives about voter fraud, and to integrate the political ground game of the left with efforts to scare racial minority groups about voting rights threats.
These Soros-funded efforts moved through dozens of 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) charities and involved the active compliance with civil rights groups, government officials, and purportedly non-partisan groups like the League of Women Voters.
The leaked documents also reveal deliberate and successful efforts to manipulate media coverage of election issues in mainstream media outlets like the The New York Times.
Conservatives and Republicans have no opposing effort or source of funds that represents even a small fraction in opposition to level of the Soros-led manipulation contained in the leaked documents.
The documents reveal that the Soros campaign fueled litigation attacking election integrity measures, such as citizenship verification and voter ID. It funded long-term efforts to fundamentally transform election administration 〞 including the creation of databases that were marketed to state governments for use in voter verification. It propped up left-leaning media to attack reports of voter fraud, and conducted racially and ideologically targeted voter registration drives.
The racially targeted voter registration drives were executed at the same time Soros dollars were funding other public relations efforts to polarize racial minority groups by scaring them about the loss of voting rights and the dangers of police officers.
The Soros documents reveal hundreds of millions of dollars being poured into the effort to transform the legal and media environment touching on elections. One document notes that poverty-alleviation programs are being de-emphasized for this new effort. It states: George Soros has authorized U.S. Programs to propose a budget of $320 million over two years, with the understanding that the annual budget for U.S. Programs will be $150 million beginning in 2013.

WikiLeaks has released the 34th batch of emails from the hacked account of Hillary Clintons campaign chair, John Podesta, on the eve of the election. This latest tranche includes 888 communications.
Much of the latest emails content repeats from previous WikiLeaks releases, because entire email threads are not always released at once.
＆Needy Latinos considered for VP 
In one leaked email, dated August 21, 2015 with the subject line ＆Needy Latinos and 1 easy call, Podesta writes to Clinton, A few calls you might consider making, apparently in relation to potential vice president choices.
Podesta then names Federico Pena, Bill Richardson and South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges. The first two are presumably the needy Latinos.
Pena, former secretary of the US Department of Transportation under President Bill Clinton, endorsed Barack Obama over Clinton for the 2008 election and served as his campaign chair. He is covered extensively in the email.
Podesta goes on to say that Penas Cabinet stints ripped up his family, and that Pena gave everything to the cause and no time to his family, he went through a messy divorce in the late 90s and was left really down and felt like no-one reached out to him then so he felt pretty cut off from Clinton World.
Podesta, passing along all of this information after speaking with former Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, gives Clinton four steps in completing a call with Pena, writing: 1) you really enjoyed seeing Cindy at the Chambers event and appreciate her support. 2) ask him how hes been doing 3) ask about his views on the race and what she should be doing in Colorado 4) ask that he consider publicly supporting you.
An email reply from Hillary Clinton herself reads: Agree about calls. Just a few additional points: several Latinos have asked that I consider Pena for VP.
On Richardson, a former governor of New Mexico and US ambassador to the UN under President Clinton, Podesta writes that a recent phone call between Bill Clinton and Richardson went well, not withstanding the fact that [Richardson] can be a dick.
He had a good conversation with the President and has been good in his interviews since, Podesta says of Richardson, telling Hillary that a call to Richardson ahead of his upcoming appearance on NBCs ＆Meet the Press might seal an endorsement.
Donna Brazile 
The extent of the cozy relationship between the Clinton campaign and CNN was revealed in an email from the former head of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, which contained, almost verbatim, the wording of a question Clinton was to be asked at a town hall in Ohio.
Sent the day before the televised event, which aired on March 13, 2016, Clinton is given the wording for a question she will be asked regarding discrimination amongst trade unions.
Also included is the wording of a question her opponent Bernie Sanders is to be asked on income inequality.

If we go by most of the MSM/corporate polls, Hillary Clinton will win on November 8. 
But there are dissenting voices. Among them is Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams , whos still predicting a 98% chance of not just a Trump win, but a landslide. Interestingly, the dissenters also include a flaming leftist 〞 docu-maker Michael Moore. 
Moore is loathsome, but I dont think anyone has captured or articulated the reasons why so many Americans resonate to Trumps anti-globalism as well as Moore. 
Below is an excerpt from a recent speech Moore delivered, followed by my transcription: 
I know a lot of people in Michigan that are planning to vote for Trump＃. They dont necessarily like him that much and they dont necessarily agree with him. Theyre not racists and rednecks certainly; theyre actually pretty decent people. And so I wanted to, after talking to a number of them, I wanted to write this. 
Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said, ＆If you close these factories youre planning to do in Detroit and build them in Mexico, [when Im President] Im going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobodys gonna buy them. 
It was an amazing thing to see. No politician, Republican or Democrat, had ever said anything like that to these executives, and it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, the Brexit states. You live here in Ohio, you know what Im talking about. 
Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because hes saying the things to people who are hurting. Thats why every beaten-down, nameless, forgotten working stiff 〞 what used to be part of what was called the middle class 〞 loves Trump. He is the human Molotov cocktail that theyve been waiting for, the human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them. And on November 8th, Election Day, although they lost their jobs, although theyve been foreclosed on by the bank, next came the divorce, and now the wife and kids are gone, the cars been repoed, they havent had a real vacation in years, theyre stuck with the shitty Obamacare plan when you cant even get a fucking [inaudible]. Theyve essentially lost everything they had, except one thing. The one thing that doesnt cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution 〞 the right to vote. 
They might be penniless, they might be homeless, they might be fucked over and fucked up. It doesnt matter because its equalized on that day. A millionaire has the same number of votes as the person without a job 〞 one. And theres more of the former middle class than there are in the millionaire class. 
So on November 8th, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain and take that lever or felt pen or touchscreen and put a big fucking X in the box by the name of the man who is threatening to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump. 
They see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump. Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The media hates Trump, after they loved him and created him and now hate him. Thank you, media. 
The enemy of my enemy is who Im voting for on November 8. Yes, on November 8, you, Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Billy Blow, Billy Bob Blow 〞 all the Blows get to blow up the whole goddamn system because its your right. Trumps election is going to be the biggest fuck-you ever recorded in human history, and it will feel good. 
Perversely, after articulately so beautifully the profound alienation of so many Americans and why Trump speaks for them, Michael Moore then proceeded to make a whole-hog defense and endorsement of Hillary Clinton. 
Heres a screenshot from a video showing Jabba the Hut Michael Moore making the speech you heard and read above. 
What if Trump loses? 
Below are excerpts from a powerful essay,  The Elite ＆Have No Idea〞 Society is Near the Breaking Point , written by a guy who calls himself Chindit13 for ZeroHedge : 
What I find most surprising today is that the insiders and the elite have no idea what is percolating just beneath the surface . Okay, maybe their arrogance actually produces its own fog, so it should not come as a surprise that they are blinded. They do not look at the calendar, which, if one really looks, says ＆1788 on it. Something is close. Very close. Society is near the breaking point. 
My own experience is that Hillarys so-called Deplorables are actually the most reserved, most polite, and most honest demographic in the country . They are more informed, more self-reliant, and among other things, better armed. Regarding their arms, they are incredibly responsible, and not the source of the violence for which the implement, and not the person, is too often blamed. The Deplorables have the longest fuse. It is, however, a fuse. [＃] 
The Deplorables, however, are not possessed of infinite patience. Like a capacitor, there is a charge building, and at some point it will be released into the circuitry of society. 
The media and other insiders believe themselves to be immune. That thought no doubt results from being immersed inside a cocoon where dissonant voices are not allowed. When the levee breaks, or the capacitor releases its charge, they are going to be gob smacked. 
Precious few of them are anywhere near as immune as they believe themselves to be. Additionally, what they might think, or hope, is their support, their security, their safe space, doesnt really exist. 
Most of societys guardians, whether they are law enforcement or military, are card-carrying members of the Deplorables. 
France was similarly constructed in the late 1780s. The elite were isolated only in thought, not in reality. Their protection was of a Potemkin Village nature: not actually there, but merely a facade that gave them false comfort. 
They paid dearly for their arrogance and ignorance. 
History may not repeat, but it does rhyme. The calendar really does seem to say 1788, so 1789〞and 1792are not as far off as some would like to believe. 
This is not a call to arms, but it is a call to reality. Ignore it at your own peril. 
Some may see these words as a threat. They are not. They are, however, a warning, and a warning from someone who is a student of history. 
Every society eventually reaches a breaking point. Ours is nearly there. Some of those who might feel threatened, the so-called elite and insiders, think that they can buy protection as easily as they can buy a Gulfstream. How na?ve! Who are the private security contractors? Who are the various SOGs? Like law enforcement and the rest of the military, they are the Deplorables. The Deplorables will take your money, but you will not take their lives. Better said, they wont give up their lives for you or your family. The security you believe you have purchased is an illusion. Make that delusion. Best to get that out front here and now. 
Some might think this is all Trumps fault. Again, that shows a degree of ignorance and na?vet which characterizes the elite. Trump is a symptom, not a cause. He might even be a salve, as the changes he could bring might defuse some of the current anger. 
On the other hand, Hillary is a lit match in a room of dynamite. She, like many of the self-important, thinks her very existence is a favor to the rest of us. She epitomizes the absolute worst of what America has become. Above the law, wealthy not through accomplishment, but through influence peddling only, and a bull in a china shop in terms of her effect on both the country and the world〞and I apologize to bulls for that analogy. The world is more unstable because of her. 
America is less safe because of her. Russia and the US〞the two largest nuclear powers〞are more at odds because of her. With her in power, we will reach the breaking point at home and internationally, perhaps leading to ＆accidental nuclear war, as the heightened rhetoric impacts clear thinking. Society is more stratified because of her. Race relations have deteriorated because of her (and Obama). 
There are few current ills in society and in geopolitics that cannot be laid at her feet, at least to some extent. The Great Deceiver to many, who exhibits an astonishing aversion to truth telling, is enough to make even an agnostic wonder if the anti-Christ hasnt finally arrived for its three and a half years of rule. 
A recently hacked email of John Podesta finds him saying ＆she (Hillary) has begun to hate everyday Americans. No doubt the same feelings were voiced by [Romania dictator] Nicolas Ceaucescu. It turned out the feeling was mutual. [＃] 
Elect Hillary, and continue with business as usual, and it is likely this warning will become an epitaph for the America we know. Society may collapse regardless, because the rot is already very great, but she will hasten the day of reckoning. [＃]

This post may be the most important post youll read on not just the 2016 election, but the entire electoral system that legitimates the U.S. republic of representative democracy. The post is long, with multiple sections, so pace yourself accordingly. I suggest you bookmark this webpage so that you can return to read or re-read. ? 
Jim Stone first posted about this two days ago on Nov. 1, 2016. 
Unsure about Stone, who calls himself an independent journalist (based in Japan) and who writes in a less-than-clear or reader-friendly manner, I refrained from writing about his post. 
Then InfoWars picked this issue up a day later on November 2. 
What is claimed is that a hidden web site of NBC affiliate WRCBtv in Chattanooga, Tenn., shows pre-determined final vote counts for an election that hasnt yet occurred 〞 the 2016 presidential election scheduled for November 8. 
Below is a screenshot Jim Stone took of the election results on WRCBtvs hidden webpage, showing Hillary Clinton winning with 343 electoral votes and 42% of the popular vote . As Stone puts it: SCAM ELECTION ALREADY CONFIRMED. TRUMP LOSES. 
Stone and InfoWars say the predetermined election results are provided by Worldnow.com. 
So what is WorldNow? 
This is what Wikipedia says, with a lot of jargon: 
WorldNow is a New York-based software company . . . [that] offers the only integrated media platform enabling broadcasters, operators and media companies to easily create, acquire, manage, analyze, monetize and distribute media assets (text, images and videos) across all digital platforms and on-air systems in a unified, end-to-end workflow . . . . Worldnows customers include CBS, COX, Dispatch, Fox Television, Meredith Corporation, Media General and Raycom Media . . . . On July 29, 2015, WorldNow announced its sale to Frankly, a San Francisco-based provider of white label social media services and mobile messaging apps . . . . In 2012, Fox Television Stations migrated its websites to WorldNows platform . . . becoming WorldNows second largest client (as of 2015, they have since switched to Lakana). In 2011, Meredith Corporation . . . began a four-year contract with WorldNow to operate its station websites. In January 2013, Media General reached a deal to move its eighteen stations to WorldNow, beginning with WFLA-TV. 
A media platform is a platform, medium or means of communicating news, such as a newspaper, TV station, Facebook , Twitter , or even a blog like FOTM . 
I typed worldnow.com in the URL bar of my laptop, but was brought to the webpage of Frankly Inc. with this URL: http://franklyinc.com/ . 
Franklys About page says: 
WorldNow , the original broadcast arm of Frankly, was founded in 1999. We now serve over 200 stations across the United States as a true partner, offering customization services and strategic trainings on industry best practices for user engagement and monetization. 
Franklys Investors page says: 
 Our customers include NBC, ABC, CBS and FOX affiliates , as well as top fashion brands, professional sports franchises and global organizations. 
In other words, WorldNow is a media software company that provides real-time data  such as election results  to local TV news stations like WRCBtv . 
You can verify this for yourself by going on WRCBtvs website: http://www.wrcbtv.com/ . Scroll down to the bottom of WRCBtvs webpage, and youll see this in the bottom left of the webpage: 
WRCBtv.com is powered by frankly and Frankly is the owner of WorldNow. In other words, WorldNow provides the content or the news for WRCBtv.com. 
Stone claims that for now, WRCBtv.coms (predetermined) election results page is hidden, awaiting WorldNow to publicly post the (fake) election results sometime in the evening of November 8, Election Day. 
I can verify that the webpage is currently hidden. Heres what I did: I typed ftpcontent2.worldnow.com/wrcb/elections/elections.htmlin the URL bar, but was brought to a McAfee Web Advisor page warning of Trouble ahead and asking meAre you sure you want to go there? I then did a Yahoo search for WRCBtv.com decision 2016. My searchs results page has this at the top: 
Note that it says Decision 2016: Complete Election Results Posted. I clicked the blue-colored  DECISION 2016: Complete Election Results  and was brought to this page of WRCBtv.com with the message: Our Apologies 
The page you requested is currently unavailable. Pages on this site are constantly being revised, updated, and occasionally removed. You may have followed an outdated link or have outdated pages in your browser cache. Heres a screenshot I took: 
So how did WorldNow come up with its predetermined final vote counts for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ? 
Answer : A method called  fractional vote . 
To begin, a fractional vote feature is embedded in the GEMS election management system of electronic voting machines , which counts approximately 25% of all votes in the United States. 
As explained by Gun&Game , the fractional vote feature can be used to invisibly, yet radically, alter election outcomes by pre-setting desired vote percentages for the candidates. The tampering can be applied across large jurisdictions in less than 60 seconds; is not visible to election observers, even if they are standing in the room and watching the computer; and is unlikely to be detected by auditing or canvass procedures. 
GEMS vote-counting systems operate under five trade names: Global Election Systems, Diebold Election Systems, Premier Election Systems, Dominion Voting Systems, and Election Systems & Software, in addition to a number of private regional subcontractors. GEMS is used statewide in Alaska, Connecticut, Georgia, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Utah and Vermont, and for counties in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. It is also used in Canada. 
Vote-rigging by electronic voting machines is real. 
A 2006 Emmy-nominated HBO documentary, Hacking Democracy , investigates the flawed integrity of electronic voting machines, particularly those made by Diebold Election Systems (now Global Election Systems), and exposes previously unknown backdoors in the Diebold trade secret computer software. Hacking Democracy documents American citizens investigating anomalies and irregularities with electronic voting systems during the 2000 and 2004 elections, especially in Volusia County, Florida. The film culminates in the on-camera hacking of the Diebold election system in Leon County, Florida 〞 the same computer voting system which has been used in elections across 39 states, and which still counts tens of millions of Americas votes today. 
So what is fractional or fractionalized vote? 
Fractional vote is a method to distort the results of an election by weighting the votes. Instead of the principle of one person-one vote, some votes are counted not as 1, but as a fraction of or less than 1 (e.g., ? or ?), or as more than 1 (e.g., 1? or 1?). The distortion of one person-one vote is in order to achieve a pre-assigned percentage of votes for each candidate. For example, Candidate A is pre-assigned 51% of the votes, Candidate B 44%, and Candidate C gets the rest 〞 5%. 
An algorithm is used to arrive at the pre-assigned percentages by changing the numbers automatically as the voting progresses. Although Candidate A in actuality received fewer number of votes than Candidate B, by weighting Candidate As votes, those votes are distorted in value, with one vote being counted, say, 25 times, so that Candidate A is the winner. And although Candidate B actually received more votes than Candidate A, Candidate Bs votes are weighted such that their values are less, with some votes converted to zero. The end result is that Candidate B loses. 
According to Jim Stone, below are the numerical votes and percentages that are the pre-assigned presidential election results for the various states , which are already on the Election Results webpage of WMCtv.com, a local TV station in Memphis, TN. (But if you go onto that webpage 〞 http://ftpcontent4.worldnow.com/wmctv/elections/wmc-electionresults.html 〞 now, all the values are 0):

Anticipating that skeptics or the vote-riggers would say that WRCBtv.coms hidden page of election results is merely a code test for the TV stations actual posting of election results on November 8, Jim Stone says that hed ripped the code out worldnow.com/kfvs12/elections.html and can confirm there is no active in it to need testing,"" i.e., ""the page has no code that will tabulate votes."" The data on the hidden page are not codes, but are ""all just typed in."" 
There is another way to demonstrate vote rigging of the 2016 election -- a webpage on election results of KFVS12 , a local TV station in Cape Girardeau, MO: http://82.221.129.208/ftpcontent4worldnowcomkfvs12elections.html . 
The webpage at present is a fakery in progress , with the final (fake) vote counts for some races already filled in, but blank for some other races. This afternoon, November 3, 2016, I took screenshots of every race with (fake) tabulations already filled in, but did not take screenshots of some blank races because I got tired of taking screenshots. The races with no (fake) vote counts are all minor races, such as those for city councils and local initiatives. 
Ask yourself this question: 
Why would the website of KFVS12, a local TV station in Missouri, have the final vote counts for some races in the upcoming November 8 elections already filled in? 
If KFVS12's election results webpage as it is now is merely a ""test-run"" to ensure that the webpage will be operative on November 8, why are the vote counts of some races -- all relatively unimportant local races -- blank? If the page is a ""test,"" there should be ""test"" vote counts for every race. 
Can anyone offer another explanation for what's been presented in this post? I'm open to alternative, non-election-fraud explanations. 
Is our entire democratic polity an illusion?

Americans didnt know about a curious species of fakery called Crisis Actors until the Dec. 14, 2012 Sandy Hook false-flag shooting massacre. (See  Remarkable resemblance of Sandy Hook victims and professional crisis actors ) 
Located in Denver, Colorado, a business that calls itself VisionBox Crisis Actors provides professionals (trained players and actors) who impersonate real-life people in simulations of mass casualty events, such as government drills, shootings and bombings, to help schools and first responders create realistic drills, full-scale exercises, high-fidelity simulations, and interactive 3D films. As an Oct. 31, 2012 feature story on the Crisis Actors website which I found on January 1, 2013, once boasted: 
A new group of actors is now available nationwide for active shooter drills and mall shooting full-scale exercises, announced Visionbox, Denvers leading professional actors studio. 
Visionbox Crisis Actors are trained in criminal and victim behavior, and bring intense realism to simulated mass casualty incidents in public places. 
The actors stage acting experience , ranging from Shakespeare to contemporary American theater, enables them to stay in character throughout an exercise, and improvise scenes of extreme stress while strictly following official exercise scenarios. [＃] 
Visionbox Crisis Actors can also play the role of citizens calling 911 or mall management, or posting comments on social media websites. 
For more, see my post  Professional crisis actors simulate mass casualty events . 
Curiously, since the phenomenon of crisis actors was uncovered after the Sandy Hook false-flag, crisis actors seem to have gone underground. VisionBox revised its website, removing any mention of crisis actors. But this video that was uploaded to YouTube on Dec. 23, 2012, says the same things about VisionBox which I had reported: 
Professor James Tracy also recently discovered that Crisisactors.org , the website established to represent the collaboration between the Visionbox professional actors studio and FEMAs Emergency Management Institute , went dormant after August 2014. (See  Where Have All the Crisis Actors Gone? ) 
To add to the insanity, there are even amputee crisis actors, such as those from a business called Amputees in Action , which provides trained professional amputee actors who promise to remain in characterfor the film and screen industries and for emergency and military services training simulations with special effects (SFX) make-up, moulage and prosthetic artists use cutting edge technology to enhance and extend the appearance and function of limb-loss scenarios. (For more, see my post  Did you know there are AMPUTEE crisis actors? ) 
Alleged victim of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, Jeff Bauman, is an example of an amputee crisis actor. See the reasons why in  Hollywood producer Nathan Folks says Boston Bombings a false flag . 
Now add fake political protests and protesters to the things that crisis actors do. 
Jamie Taete reports for Vice , Aug. 6, 2013, that Crowds on Demand is a company that will organize a crowd for you, on demand. The crowd can be fake fans for some celebrity or aspiring celebrity, or fake protesters for a cause. 
Since the companys fake fan events are super secret, Taete attended instead a fake protest called Purge Day USA (to purge mental health problems) which the company organized in Los Angeles in coordination with a charity to raise awareness about mental health issues. Heres a photo of the fake protesters: 
Crowds on Demands founder and CEO Adam Swart said that there were about 20 protesters at the fake protest and all of them were provided by me. The fake protesters were paid $15 an hour. Swart charges a couple thousand dollars to organize a fake protest with about 20 actors, but he gives discounts to charities. 
To critics who say Crowds on Demand is unethical, Swart , who is only 24 years old , openly and brazenly admits: Is it misleading? Yes. Thats the idea. 
A more recent example of fake protesters is an ad on Craigs List soliciting actors to impersonate protesters at Trump rallies. 
As reported by ZeroHedge on March 30, 2016, the ad was placed by Im feelin the Bern Bernie Sanders supporters who promise to provide shuttle buses, parking, and protest signs, as well as $15/hour to the actors. Heres a screenshot of the Craigs List ad: 
The above ad has since been removed by its author , but the Daily Caller points out the ad is part of a recurring pattern of anti-Trump Craigslist ads soliciting and paying people to protest at Trump rallies. But Daily Caller claims that the fake protesters are hired not by Sanders, but by Hillary Clintons people, and paid for by the usual suspects George Soros, MoveOn.org, and Progressive Auto Insurance ＆s Jonathan Lewis : 
The Establishment on both the left and the right, who want to disenfranchise the millions of Republican voters who support Donald Trump, have blamed the staged riots near Trump rallies on Trump or on Bernie Sanders. Thats like blaming the Russians for the Reichstag Fire. Bernie has little to do with these manufactured protests. This is a Clinton operation, a faux protest. 
False flag operations have long been common in politics, but these riots are poisonous to the electorate, intentionally designed to turn violent and stifle free speech. 
This free speech-busting goon squad operation is directed by supporters of Hillary Clinton. It is paid for mostly by George Soros and MoveOn.org and pushed by David Brock at Media Matters for America. Its also funded by reclusive billionaire Jonathan Lewis, who was identified by the Miami New Times as a mystery man. He inherited roughly a billion dollars from his father Peter Lewis (founder of Progressive Insurance Company). 
A march and demonstration against Trump at Trump Tower essentially fizzled Saturday when only 500 protesters of the promised 5000 showed up. Infiltrating the crowd, I learned most were from MoveOn or the Occupy movement. Soap was definitely in short supply in this crowd. Several admitted answering a Craigs list ad paying $16.00 an hour for protesters. 
Hillary understands that Trump would lose the votes of certain establishment Republicans if he were the nominee. On the other hand, it doesnt matter, because of his crossover outreach. In Michigan, Democrats and independents who have lost their jobs because of disastrous globalist trade deals like NAFTA are lining up to vote for Donald. 
And so, when you see an anti-Trump protest or another mass shooting, dont believe your eyes. The protesters and victims〞 including amputees! 〞 you see may just be acting.

Presidential elections are a form of madness that comes over us once every four years. They fit the great-man or -woman narrative of history, seducing us into forgetting how powerful we are. They erase our memory of grassroots power, direct democracy and civil society. Leaders beget followers; people pin their hopes on one person, and with that they seem to shed responsibility for anything beyond getting that one person into office. Or, they wash their hands of any further involvement if its not their one person. 
And so it is this time around. With the election a matter of days away and the media engrossed in a fight to end all fights, it sometimes seems as though weve lost sight of the powers that belong to us and not them, and the responsibilities and possibilities that go with our power. The intensely personal nature of this campaign  and the particular danger of Donald Trump  has created a kind of tunnel vision. 
""We forget our own influence, the innumerable times weve swayed outcome."" 
Which is not to say that the outcome is unimportant. Far from it. Many Clinton supporters seem quietly confident of a win. I am less complacent. Weve had enough surprises this year  in Britain, in Colombia  to know that voters have a way of confounding those who observe them. A Trump presidency would be a terrible thing. But a Clinton victory would be far from an occasion to sigh with relief, sit back and resume life as though the last few months had been a bad dream. A Clinton victory, in fact, would be just a starting point for a new kind of campaign. 
A politician is not a given. Each one is in part what we make them, by pushing, blocking, pressuring, encouraging, fighting, reframing, emphasizing, organizing. Every election season we pretend that one person will have all the power and that whatever they promise up front is exactly who theyll be, for better or worse. We forget our own influence, the innumerable times weve swayed outcomes, such as the decision to veto the Keystone XL pipeline. We forget the way culture and activism set the norms for political decisions on matters such as same-sex marriage rights. 
Election seasons erase the memory of movements that worked for years or decades, outside and around, below and above electoral politics. They drown out the histories that matter: how women got the vote, how the civil rights movement progressed, how the Free Trade Area of the Americas trade deal withered and died, how the World Trade Organization was hobbled and its poorer member nations inspired to revolt by the great 1999 shutdown in Seattle, how fracking got banned in New York State, how rape law has been radically revised in many ways and places thanks to feminist action and discourse. In all these cases, the people who we mislabel leaders only followed the will of the people. 
To reiterate: it matters who is president, but what a president does has everything to do with what the people demand or refuse or do themselves, and what the House and Senate send them or sabotage. 
Mitt Romney promised to build the Keystone XL pipeline himself if elected; Republicans for the foreseeable future will be puppets of the fossil-fuel industry. Democrats are not necessarily our friends or allies, but they are sometimes politicians who can be pushed. Obama wavered on that pipeline for several years. When he vetoed it, it was not because of who he is, but because of who we are, we the members of a climate movement that organized, educated, campaigned, blockaded and demonstrated for years, building a powerful movement. 
That the president has become so much more engaged with climate is a result what the movement did: it educated us on the science, made the case for the urgency and importance of action, built global coalitions, shed light on the ways climate is an economic and racial justice issue, started innumerable campaigns to block pipelines, divest, implement efficiency and good design, and shift to renewable resources. A lot of other changes that matter have happened at the local level as cities, regions and states have done great work on climate, led by community organizers, small groups and minor politicians youll never hear about. 
The Obama administration could have done much more if more of the people who elected him stuck around to push back against the corporations, well-organized conservatives and big-money interests. Which is not to even raise the question of that administrations principles; its more useful to ask what are our own, if most of us do little or nothing about policies we deplore or ideals we praise. 
The same will be true of a Clinton administration, if thats the one voters choose on Tuesday. The extent to which it serves the interests of people and our planet depends in part on the extent to which citizens apply pressure to it. You may feel exhausted right now; tired of a bruising cycle which has left no personal stone unturned (often to the detriment of policy scrutiny). But the truth is, were at the beginning  either of a period of sustained resistance against a racist, misogynist, deranged climate-denier  or a period of sustained action to push the first female president to deliver a genuinely progressive, climate-conscious agenda. 
If we end up with a Democrat (and I regret that thats the best choice we get in this binary election), a lot is up to us. Thats a gift and a responsibility. Ill take it. I hope youll join me.

In recent months, WikiLeaks and I personally have come under enormous pressure to stop publishing what the Clinton campaign says about itself to itself. That pressure has come from the campaigns allies, including the Obama administration, and from liberals who are anxious about who will be elected US President. 
On the eve of the election, it is important to restate why we have published what we have. 
The right to receive and impart true information is the guiding principle of WikiLeaks  an organization that has a staff and organizational mission far beyond myself. Our organization defends the publics right to be informed. 
This is why, irrespective of the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election, the real victor is the US public which is better informed as a result of our work. 
The US public has thoroughly engaged with WikiLeaks election related publications which number more than one hundred thousand documents. Millions of Americans have pored over the leaks and passed on their citations to each other and to us. It is an open model of journalism that gatekeepers are uncomfortable with, but which is perfectly harmonious with the First Amendment. 
We publish material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere. When we have material that fulfills this criteria, we publish. We had information that fit our editorial criteria which related to the Sanders and Clinton campaign (DNC Leaks) and the Clinton political campaign and Foundation (Podesta Emails). No-one disputes the public importance of these publications. It would be unconscionable for WikiLeaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election. 
At the same time, we cannot publish what we do not have. To date, we have not received information on Donald Trumps campaign, or Jill Steins campaign, or Gary Johnsons campaign or any of the other candidates that fufills our stated editorial criteria. As a result of publishing Clintons cables and indexing her emails we are seen as domain experts on Clinton archives. So it is natural that Clinton sources come to us. 
We publish as fast as our resources will allow and as fast as the public can absorb it. 
That is our commitment to ourselves, to our sources, and to the public. 
This is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election. The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers. I spoke at the launch of the campaign for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, because her platform addresses the need to protect them. This is an issue that is close to my heart because of the Obama administrations inhuman and degrading treatment of one of our alleged sources, Chelsea Manning. But WikiLeaks publications are not an attempt to get Jill Stein elected or to take revenge over Ms Mannings treatment either. 
Publishing is what we do. To withhold the publication of such information until after the election would have been to favour one of the candidates above the publics right to know. 
This is after all what happened when the New York Times withheld evidence of illegal mass surveillance of the US population for a year until after the 2004 election, denying the public a critical understanding of the incumbent president George W Bush, which probably secured his reelection. The current editor of the New York Times has distanced himself from that decision and rightly so. 
The US public defends free speech more passionately, but the First Amendment only truly lives through its repeated exercise. The First Amendment explicitly prevents the executive from attempting to restrict anyones ability to speak and publish freely. The First Amendment does not privilege old media, with its corporate advertisers and dependencies on incumbent power factions, over WikiLeaks model of scientific journalism or an individuals decision to inform their friends on social media. The First Amendment unapologetically nurtures the democratization of knowledge. With the Internet, it has reached its full potential. 
Yet, some weeks ago, in a tactic reminiscent of Senator McCarthy and the red scare, Wikileaks, Green Party candidate Stein, Glenn Greenwald and Clintons main opponent were painted with a broad, red brush. The Clinton campaign, when they were not spreading obvious untruths, pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with Russia. The campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publications〞because none exists. 
In the end, those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them  a reason for censorship the First Amendment cannot tolerate. Only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate. 
WikiLeaks decade-long pristine record for authentication remains. Our key publications this round have even been proven through the cryptographic signatures of the companies they passed through, such as Google. It is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them. 
We have endured intense criticism, primarily from Clinton supporters, for our publications. Many long-term supporters have been frustrated because we have not addressed this criticism in a systematic way or responded to a number of false narratives about Wikileaks motivation or sources. Ultimately, however, if WL reacted to every false claim, we would have to divert resources from our primary work. 
WikiLeaks, like all publishers, is ultimately accountable to its funders. Those funders are you. Our resources are entirely made up of contributions from the public and our book sales. This allows us to be principled, independent and free in a way no other influential media organization is. But it also means that we do not have the resources of CNN, MSNBC or the Clinton campaign to constantly rebuff criticism. 
Yet if the press obeys considerations above informing the public, we are no longer talking about a free press, and we are no longer talking about an informed public. 
Wikileaks remains committed to publishing information that informs the public, even if many, especially those in power, would prefer not to see it. WikiLeaks must publish. It must publish and be damned.

Dear Youth, 
On this day after the election, many are asking themselves how this could have happened. Regardless of who anyone close to you voted for, and regardless of how you yourself might vote, in a democratic country, the questions still remain: How could so few be allowed to vote? Why do so few who are eligible vote? How can we call ourselves a country when there seems to be so much hatred between those with differing ideologies? Do we care at all for people who are not like us? These questions can be maddening, but I beg you, dont give up hope. I promise you that just the thought of you gives so many of us so much hope. Especially me. And also, please dont fall into the temptation to hate those who may hate you. These times we are living in are reminding me, oddly enough, of the Empire Strikes Back. Luke, reacting to the violence of the world tries to combat it with more violence and ends up getting his hand cut off. Its only after he goes and studies the intricacies of justice that he is able to confront Darth Vader and the Emperor in triumph. If I were to pick a Grandmaster Jedi of our world, it would be Dr. Howard Thurman, the pastor of Martin Luther King. Dr. Thurman wrote of hate, The logic of the development of hatred is death to the spirit and disintegration of ethical and moral value. While hatred is a natural emotion, acting from it and allowing it to take root will never accomplish the goals we want them to. I call you StillSpeaking Youth to combat what I have seen older generations do to younger generations throughout my lifetime and into history. Each generation seems to think that their generation was the one that knew how best to fight. Im afraid that the older I get the more I might start saying to younger folkx, At least MY generation had the Occupy Movement. or At least my generation was involved in the Black Lives Matter Movement. But the truth of the matter is that every generation gets their chance to shine and be a part of creating what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. called, The Beloved Community. We hear a lot about Dr. Kings Dream, but what we hear are the little specifics, white children and Black children holding hands and blah, blah, blah. We often miss the big picture. The big picture was that Dr. King believed, as I do, that there is a world possible right here that is far different than the world we live in today. In that world: there is no hatred over religious and political differences; everyone is loved and cherished for who they are, no matter the color of their skin, their sexual orientation, their gender expression; and people arent treated differently because of how much money they make or what job they work. That Dream is possible, but only when we all put our hands into making this Beloved Community come true. I love each and every one of you so much, even when you get on my nerves I want to protect you from every harmful oppression. But the best way I know how to do that, is to try and help you be survivors in a world of hate. I always want to show you the survival tools I learned, and also the tools Ive learned to help create a Beloved Community. Because I know, that just as I will someday be among the eldest generation of this world and that I hope to eventually be an ancestor that you call upon in your struggles, you will someday have to step up to the responsibilities of creating the Beloved Community in your own world just as me and my generation have. You dont have to do it like us, in fact I really hope you dont, weve made a lot of mistakes, but I want you to be those Love Warriors, I need you to be those Love Warriors, and I vow to be the Elder that you need. Just keep holding on and know this, the ancestors, including Dr. Thurman and Dr. King, are ALWAYS there when you call. You know I love you, Tai Amri (Baby Pastor and Jedi Master) Spann-Wilson 4.0 ",english,2016-11-11T10:38:20.805+02:00,filmsforaction.org,CA,40299,To the Youth a Day After the Election: Another World Is Possible,0,http://www.filmsforaction.org/img/o/a3621846-eb40-4560-83b5-b3e7bc7ecec1.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Negative

I am now convinced that the Oligarchy that rules America intends to steal the presidential election. In the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Trump. 
Most likely you are unaware of what Trump is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this is not endeared to the oligarchs. 
Who are the oligarchs? Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve, a federal agency that put 5 banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless. The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power. The neoconservatives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China. The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs. Agribusiness (Monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their GMOs, herbicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops. The extractive industries〞energy, mining, fracking, and timber〞that maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply. The Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israels way. 
What convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes reporting and the facts on the ground. 
According to the presstitutes, Hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in Trump supporters bothering to vote. Hillary has won the election before the vote. Hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner. 
I am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillarys public appearances are unattended but Trumps are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida: 
Trump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and stickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages. 
I know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity. 
I also receive from readers similar reports from around the country. 
This is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: The media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only Americans but also the world, that Donald Trump is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote. 
By controlling the explanation, when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundation in the media. All media reports will say that it was a runaway victory for Hillary over the misogynist immigrant-hating Trump. 
And liberal, progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as Hillary takes us into nuclear war. 
That the Oligarchy intends to steal the election from the American people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in Texas. The NPR presstitutes have declared that Hillary is such a favorite that even Republican Texas is up for grabs in the election. 
If this is the case, why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change Trump votes to Hillary votes? Those voters who noted that they voted Trump but were recorded Hillary complained. The election officials, claiming a glitch (which only went one way), changed to paper ballots. But who will count them? No glitches caused Hillary votes to go to Trump, only Trump votes to go to Hillary. 
The most brilliant movie of our time was The Matrix. This movie captured the life of Americans manipulated by a false reality, only in the real America there is insufficient awareness and no Neo, except possibly Donald Trump, to challenge the system. Americans of all stripes〞academics, scholars, journalists, Republicans, Democrats, right-wing, left-wing, US Representatives, US Senators, Presidents, corporate moguls and brainwashed Americans and foreigners〞live in a false reality. 
In the United States today a critical presidential election is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed by Hillary and the presstitutes. This is total failure. Democracy, once the hope of the world, has totally failed in the United States of America. Trump is correct. The American people must restore the accountability of government to the people.

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has directly pressured Russian diplomats and forbid them from being near voting places during the presidential elections in the United States on November 8th. Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman of the Russian foreign ministry, wrote about this on her Facebook page on Monday. 
Its come to openly intimidating the staff of diplomatic agencies. The State Department recommended Russian representatives in a memo ＆not to come to polling stations on their own, and some states authorities have gone even further and threatened criminal prosecution. This means that they cant even watch the voting procedure, Zakharova wrote. 
According to Zakharova, in recent days, direct pressure has been put on Russian representatives in the United States by the FBI, whose agents, with undisguised threats, have let us know that we should not be interested in the American elections. 
In Houston, in order to offer such a ＆warning, a Hollywood-style special operation was arranged that blocked the car of our Consulate Generals employees on the street. They stopped the car and started to ＆convince them that they should not watch the voting, and not even think about it, Zakharova added. 

In connection with the incident with the Russian embassy in Washington, a relevant submission has already been made to the State Department.  
But the question arises: what can a foreign diplomat see at American polling stations that is so important that theyve brought in ＆Mr. Smith, and why are election monitoring procedures controlled by the FBI?!, the Russian foreign ministrys representative concluded.

Crimean leader Sergey Aksenov welcomed the choice of the American people in the US presidential elections despite what he called numerous violations in the electoral process. 
Aksenov stated: The American people have made their choice. Our president was clear: the Russian Federation is not interfering in or even making any attempts to influence the will of the American people. In my opinion, the elections were held with numerous violations. If this had happened in Crimea or Russia, then the elections would have been assessed differently by American politicians. They would say that everything was wrong and illegitimate. But the Americans did not allow Russian diplomats near polling stations and prevented the formation of an objective view of what was happening at polling stations and overall how the elections were being held in the US. 
Commenting on Trumps pre-election promises in regards to Russia and the Republic of Crimea, Aksenov said: Before elections, politicians usually make some statements, and then their program can radically change. Time will tell. I am sure that our president will make sufficient efforts so that Crimea will be recognized throughout the world. 
This summer, Trump stated that he would be ready to look into the question of recognizing Crimea as Russian territory and lifting the sanctions against Russia if he won the elections. He remarked that Crimeans want to be with Russia and that this should be considered by the international community. These words caused great anxiety in Kiev. 

The leader of the Donetsk Peoples Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, was cautious in being optimistic towards Trumps election as US president. Zakharchenko expressed concern that after Trump moves into the White House, he will become part of the American political system and there is no guarantee that he will be able to resist this system. For the DPR, Trumps suggested policies could signal a change in attitude towards the Ukrainian crisis.

Fabrizio Poggi, in  Contropiano , translated from Italian by Tom Winter 

Igor Dodon, President-elect of Moldova 
Moldova and Bulgaria: Something new in the East 
Rumen Radev, President-elect of Bulgaria 
In the east - not everywhere, sadly - there is a turn towards Moscow. The newly elected presidents of Moldavia and Bulgaria seem to want to go in that direction. 

In Kishinev, where two weeks ago, no candidate had a majority in round one, the Socialist Party leader, Igor Dodon, has 52.6% of the votes (not including expatriate votes from US and Canada, but these can not overturn the result) against the pro-EU Maia Sandu, leader of the Action and Solidarity Party, with 47.3% and who, in Yankee fashion, is now threatening ""mass demonstrations,"" not recognizing the result. 
Maia Sandu  Dodon congratulated Sandu for the ""honorable result"" and invited her to discussions, without destabilizing the country. It seems (though not official at this time of writing) that the turnout was respectable; this was the first direct election of the president of the republic since 1996; since 2000 in fact, the President was elected by Parliament. There was even shortage of ballots, in particular in various stations abroad: Bologna, Parma, Paris, Moscow, Bucharest; Portugal appears to have lost the entire st of ballots. 

On the eve of the vote Dodon, an experienced office-holder, (Deputy Prime Minister in 2008-2009 and Minister of Economy in 2006-2009) said that if he won, his first visit abroad would would be to Moscow, ""to start working out a strategic partnership agreement"" and to renew exports to Russia, which were limited after the signing of the association and free trade agreement with the EU.  

Dodon has always said he was ""confident of victory. People are tired of the seven years of EU coalition, poverty, corruption, lawlessness, and want to live in a state of their own and not in some province of another country.""  

The socialist leader has also called for the Russian peacekeepers to remain in Transnistria, until the complete solution of the political events through the federalization of Moldova, which Sandu opposes. According to Tass, all candidates had based their election campaign primarily on foreign issues: pointing on one side to the ""hand of the Kremlin,"" and, on the other to ""Washington's Regional Committee,""  a side which was still floating a union with Romania. The Socialists pointed to Maia Sandu as ""a puppet of the US"" - where she studied and worked at the World Bank, and tied her to Angela Merkel, Donald Tusk, and Jean-Claude Juncker, apparently even to former Romanian President, Traian B?sescu, who got himself awarded Moldovan citizenship [! -tr] in order to vote for Maia Sandu.  

On the other side Sandu was proposing, along with strategic partnership with Washington, close contacts with Kiev, even a future union with Romania. 

As expected, there are the threats of yet another ""Orange Revolution,"" like the one in 2009 after the Communist Party won the election in Moldova, under the flags of EU and Romania, with rioting which brought broken windows and arson to the Parliament and the presidential residence.  

Obviously, Brussels was on the ""orange"" side: the results of seven years of EU-line coalition are also seen in the demonstrations a year ago against the oligarchy in power, in the rejection of government policy on the part of 80% of the population, and in those favoring integration with Brussels falling from 70% to 37%.  

In addition, the Donald Trump victory seems to have played a role also in Kishinev: ""The geopolitical color of the Moldovan leadership will become less important for the United States,"" Andrei Popov said in a NewsMaker interview. Popov, former Deputy Foreign Minister of Moldova, added that Washington will renounce a whole series of Moldovan projects that were initiated by the Clinton circle. 

Also, in Bulgaria, the coalition headed by the Socialist Party prevailed in the second presidential round of the general election: Air Force General Rumen Radev topped his opponent Tsetska Tsa?eva by 4-5% (the result is not final). Tsa?eva was the candidate of the pro-government coalition GERB (""Citizens for European development of Bulgaria).""  

In the first round, Sunday, Nov. 6, no candidate reached the 30% necessary for the election: Radev was at 25.4% and Tsa?eva at 21.9%.  

The now president-elect said he was opposed to Bulgaria's permanence in NATO (of which the country has been a member since 2004) and in the EU, and has spoken out for closer relations with Russia.  

The Prime Minister, the hawk Boyko Borissov had promised to resign if Radev won, while he was still hoping for a Tsa?eva victory, seems to have kept his word, opening a crisis that does not seem easy to solve. 

In opposition to the overtly anti-Russian, phil-atlantic policies of former President Rosen Plevneliev and Boyko Borissov, Radev said that ""deepening the dialogue with Russia will reduce confrontation and tension, and hopefully lead to the normalization of the situation in Syria and Ukraine.""  

With regard to the anti-Russian sanctions, he stressed that this ""is a matter of the government's responsibility. But, as President, I am committed to dialogue, to seek a solution with EU colleagues."" As for internal affairs, he said ""despite threats of the apocalypse,"" the voters ""voted for change and democracy, overcoming apathy and fear."" 

An entity that in contrast does not change policy towards Russia is the European Union.  Federica Mogherini,  EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, said that Brussels does not intend to change its own position on Russia, even if the White House, after the arrival of Donald Trump, pursues a rapprochement with the Kremlin.  

The EU, as Mogherini spelled it out, ""has a principled stand on the issue of the annexation of the Crimea and on the situation in Ukraine, and will not change it, regardless of any changes of position by other countries, including the United States.  

""Ipse dixit et salvavit eos**; of course, the ""Russian aggression!

- Enrico VIGNA in  Opinione Pubblica , translated from Italian by Tom Winter - 

The election of Igor Dodon follows upon decades of the robbery and systematic looting of the country by politicians and related parties, financed and protected by  

the West,  the International Monetary Fund,  the World Bank,  the EU and  NATO,  
which have made the country Europe's poorest; in fact, according to an IMF study, per capita income in Moldova at constant purchasing power is $ 5,006. This is a figure referring to those who physically live in the country, disregarding those who have emigrated to the West.  

Even a UNDP report (United Nations Development Program), has determined that 8.1% of the population lives below the international poverty line of $ 1.25 a day (2000-2007); but 48.5% live below the so-called national poverty line.  

Moldova is a country located between Ukraine and Romania with population of 3.6 million, of whom more than half live abroad. Its official language is Romanian, but a large part speaks Russian.  

Moldova is considered one of the most corrupt countries in Europe, preceded only by Georgia, located at 103rd position in the Corruption Perceptions Index 2015 of Transparency International.  

On November 13 there was the second round of presidential elections, where the candidate of the Socialist Party of the Republic of Moldova prevailed with 52.18% of the total, but in Moldova without the foreign votes, the figure is 75%.  

This is despite the whole set of the ""big powers"" system: parties, apparatus, media and pro-Western NGOs that have made every effort and financial investment, electoral sabotage, blackmail, pressure and threats in the press and the media, which are completely in the hands of pro-Western rulers.  

An example reported by the electoral bloc for the Socialist candidate Dodon is that while in the West the Moldovan government set up hundreds of polling places to allow their emigrants to vote, (overwhelmingly supporters of the West as they became rich and culturally westernized, no need to comment further), in the first round in Italy 80% had voted for the American Sandu and 7% for Dodon!  

BUT, in Russia and in other countries where the migrant workers do not recognize the West as a model or solution, the government reduced polling places to a minimum: just think that in a city like Moscow, where more than 700,000 Moldovan emigrants live and work, the government only put up three polling places. 

On the ballot were Igor Dodon, a lawyer and economist, until 2011 leader of Moldovan communists, who then joined the Socialist Party, of which he is currently president; and Maia Sandu, former education minister from 2012 to 2015, of the corrupt governments of Filat, who is currently in jail.  

She represents the Action and Solidarity Party, supported by the US and EU; she graduated in the United States where she lived from 1989 to 1994, served as an official of the World Bank, protected by the Soros Foundation.  

Igor Dodon is a man who comes from the people, the father of three sons, the person who founded the Charity Foundation ""Solution,"" which, in all the years of its existence has helped tens of thousands of people; who organized and leads the patriotic campaign ""I love Moldova,"" which managed hundreds of actions at national level supporting the Moldovan identity and the defense of Orthodoxy as the spiritual heritage of the people.  

The clash between the candidates was very deep and went beyond the exclusively Moldovan reality. Rather it involves a change of balance with geopolitical meanings, which could give a strong blow to the Western hegemonic and imperialist aims: just think of the internal problem of Transnistria, the hitherto close relationship between the coup leaders in Ukrainian Kiev and the pro-europeen forces of Chisinau, the position towards the Donbass Popular Republics, Belarus, South Ossetia and especially the position of rejecting NATO.  

Yes this a sensitive issue and a harbinger of strategic upheavals; in addition to the rejection of reunification with (in fact as a submission to) Romania, Ms Sandu supported the Association and Free Trade with the European Union Agreement ratified in 2014, which is now part of the DCFTA (Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. Dodon instead proposed and supported Moldova's entry into the Eurasian Economic Union with Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan, and supported trying for closer relations and investment with China. 


The Dodon victory is based 90% on the population that lives out the devastated social reality produced during thirty years of robbery and wild privatization, namely the workers and the poorest peasants, regional minorities such as the Gagauz, the Bessarabi and the Russians; by the hundreds of thousands of migrants in Russia; and even the Orthodox Church supports the change.  

The pro-European candidate was driven primarily by the inhabitants of the capital Chisinau, by profiteers who settled in the state and public offices, through corruption and political favoritism, and especially by the emigrants in the West.  

Now, it is a matter of waiting for the excellent election platform to be applied into Moldovan reality, and above all the next steps, including calling new elections.  

One thing is certain: the programs hitherto adopted resulted in impoverishment and social devastation, products of Western policies in the former Soviet countries, but they have found they here an unexpected setback, and the Moldovan people, like others in the realities of Eastern Europe, are taking charge of their destiny.   

Hope finds a seedling to nurture and strengthen. In any case it is a disturbing signal for the aims of Western expansion and domination, and especially the military ones and oppression by NATO.

According to Democrats, the only thing in life which isnt rigged is this election. 
As long as Hillary Clinton is said by the pollsters to be in the lead and likely to win, the system is just fine  but only the election system. 
It cant be rigged if the democrats win. A democrat being in power is the natural order of things. I think it may actually be a part of Darwins evolutionary theory. First the protozoa, then the fish, then the ape, then the Neanderthal Republican, and finally, the enlightened progressive Democrat. Thats how it goes  right? 
It is amusing that the same people and party, who claim that everything in America is somehow rigged, think it ridiculous when the Republican nominee claims that of this election  and that Republican voters are the ones this time being disenfranchised. 
In August of this year, the Washington Post claimed that Exxon Mobil is rigging the system against green energy. Of course they are. After all, they are the poster-corporation of evil big oil. As recently as last year, it continued to fund organizations that play down the risks of carbon pollution, writes the Post. 
So rigged is the system that the AGs of the communist states of New York and Massachusetts, are investigating whether ExxonMobil violated state laws by knowingly misleading their residents and shareholders about climate change. 
Big Oil  Climate Change  Rigged  Check. 
In 2015, Director of the University of Cambridge Master of Finance program, Simon Taylor wrote that, Bank executive pay appears rigged against women. He found that female bank execs pay packages typically have a much lower level of incentive compensation, netting women much less than male counterparts. 
That same year, the NewStatesman.com wrote that, Women cant have it all  because the game is rigged. The author is upset that women have to choose between having a high-powered career and spending time raising a family. Yeah  I know. If the system wasnt so rigged, women could have it all  a model family and equal pay  unless, of course, if they work for the Clinton Foundation. 
Women  Equal Pay  Rigged  Check 
Naturally, the system is rigged against the poor and the middle class. The working class warrior, Elizabeth Warren , who is worth almost $15 million, said in an interview with CNN : Let's just be real clear - the game is rigged and it's rigged in favor of those who have money and who have power, like Elizabeth Warren. 
Middle Class  Poor  Workers of the World Unite - Rigged  Check 
There are many more examples of the democrats and liberals in general (redundant) whining of this ethereal system being rigged against every constituent group under their umbrella , that I would be remiss to not mention the seminal complaint of all the left. The system has been and will always be rigged against blacks  particularly the justice system. 
Everywhere in America, according to the left, are examples of a rigged justice system, where blacks, minding their own business, are rounded up, arrested, and summarily shot. So rigged is the system , that George Washington University law professor Paul Butler, who is a former federal prosecutor, has suggested the remedy ought to be widespread jury nullification. ＆It is, in fact, the moral responsibility of black jurors to emancipate some guilty black outlaws.

With all this rigging going on, maybe the only fair thing to do is allow Hillary and her minions to do whatever they must to win, thus righting some of the wrongs of the rigged system. It should be our moral responsibility to emancipate some guilty democrat outlaws.

There is a sizeable faction in this country that is disgusted with the choices we have going into the 2016 General Election. While the choices are far from the quality a great nation like the United States deserves, they are what they are. No amount of complaining, abdication of responsibility, or indignation will change this reality. 
But, like it or not, the outcome of this election will affect each and every one of us, and in ways that can never be rectified in our lifetimes, if at all. It is for that reason that this election is a referendum on the issues, not on the candidates. It is also for this reason that it needs to be reiterated  in no uncertain terms  that General Elections are not for electing your favorite candidate. They are for protecting the country from the worst candidate. 
Right now, we have two candidates  arguably not the best the country can offer, who possess two extremely different visions for the country. It is about these differences  exclusively  that we must base our choices come Election Day. Put bluntly, this election isnt about personalities, capabilities, soundbites or even criminality; it is about issues, and on these issues, we do have choices to make. 
Yes, the names on the ballot give us pause. I will cede that point but offer this rebuttal for your consideration. 
On the one hand, we have a politically untested, braggadocios businessman in Donald Trump who routinely makes statements before he thinks about the consequences of his words. But while many may have their principles insulted by the prospect of casting a vote for such an overt braggart, there is no question that he loves and appreciates the country that has allowed him to be so successful. 
On the other hand, we have Hillary Clinton , a woman who has, but for a very short stint at a private law firm, always lived taking a taxpayer-funded government check. For getting on 30 years this woman has fed off the taxpayer feed trough, advancing her ideological agenda  one tilted to the whims of the Fabian Progressive that she is, admittedly, and establishing and engaging in bureaucratic corruption so extensive that she has been able to parlay her public service into an amassed wealth of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
So, in personality and professionally, we have a stark and glaring choice in the people that are on the ballot. One, Trump, has a love of country but no political prowess, the other, Clinton, has decades of inside-the-beltway experience but a deeply seeded desire to fundamentally transform the nation from a Constitutional Republic to a Socialist Democracy administered by a Progressive oligarchy. 
Larger than the personalities in this election, however, are two very important and critical issues; issues that these two candidates  as flawed as they are  have decidedly different ideas about. 
We are standing at a moment where we control whether or not the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) remains a binding law or whether it gets repealed. Make no mistake, Hillary Clinton, if elected, will cement this incredibly unconstitutional law into the very fabric of our country for all-time. The only way Obamacare will be abandoned under a Clinton Administration is in deference to the establishment of a full-blown single-payer health insurance system administered by the Federal Government, i.e. nationalized healthcare. 
Donald Trump, on the other hand, has made a cornerstone of his campaign the repeal of Obamacare. He has pledged to destroy the artificial barriers in the marketplace  barriers erected by insurance company-friendly politicians  that keep the free market from allowing competition that would dramatically lower premium costs for everyone. This, as a result  through competition in the free market  would make health insurance affordable for all. 
So, the choice is abundantly clear  unless you are a Socialist or a Marxist  on who has already earned your vote on the issue of Obamacare. Unless you want your health insurance premiums to rise to unaffordability and the quality of your healthcare to take a downturn to that of a Third World country, you need to cast a vote for Donald Trump so that Hillary Clinton doesnt make Obamacare permanent. 
Then there is the matter of the United States Supreme Court. The direction of the nation, with regard to constitutionalism, hangs in the balance this election. With the next President of the United States most likely getting to nominate three, and possibly four, United States Supreme Court justices, we are at a crossroads as to whether we jettison the Constitution completely or return to being a nation of laws and not of men, of which John Adams spoke. 
The US Supreme Court is seated to protect and defend the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights, exclusively. The justices are tasked with ruling on the constitutionality of law, not on the people effected by that law. As   Bill of Rights were crafted to serve all of the people  regardless of race, creed, gender or economic class  serving the Constitution is, by that very act, serving the people. 
Hillary Clinton, in the last debate, spoke of appointing Supreme Court justices who would be empathetic to the people and their causes. She talked of her selections being mindful of the people in the decisions they would be faced with making. She said she envisions a Supreme Court that stands up on behalf of womens rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country and that her nominees would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans. 
But none of that  none of it  is what the US Supreme Court is supposed to engage in, as duly noted above. Women, the LGBT community, and even the political process are best served when the Constitution is best served and adequately protected. What Hillary Clinton proposed, in her answer, was to establish an activist special-interest Supreme Court bench that serves entities rather than the Constitution, a document that serves everyone equitably and equally when administered as the Framers intended. 
In incredible and stark contrast, Donald Trump has pledged to nominate justices to the Supreme Court who would interpret the Constitution the way the Founders wanted it interpreted. In that short, simple response Trump said what each and every American should want to hear in an answer to that query. He will appoint justices that will serve and protect the Constitution, returning the Supreme Court to the rule of law. 
So, again, unless you are a social justice activist with a Fabian Progressive bent, the choice is clear on who should get your vote regarding the issue of the US Supreme Court. Trump wants justices who rule on constitutionality, while Clinton wants justices who rule on a special-interest, social justice agenda. 
In the worst case scenario; should Hillary Clinton win on November 8th, we can be guaranteed of two things. First, Obamacare and its never-ending rate hikes  not to mention the Progressive march to a single-payer health insurance system run exclusively by the Federal Government  will be here forever. Second, the US Supreme Court  and the whole of the federal courts beneath it  will be lost to at least one generation (maybe two) of Progressive-Liberalism; codifying countless new social justice laws and mandates onto the American people. 
These are the issues that consume this election. To wit, this election is an ipso facto referendum on Obamacare and the direction of the US Supreme Court, nothing else; no personalities, no crimes, no sex scandals, nothing else. 
This is why there can be no abdication by the American people of their responsibilities to vote. Yes, the candidates may not be the best our nation has to offer, but the issues are more serious than the personality, ethics and knowledge deficits possessed by either. Just because you may hate the choices doesnt mean the issues become benign. 
While Trump, if he should win, may end up having to surround himself with people more knowledgeable than he on most every matter, that is infinitely better than giving the Oval Office to Hillary Clinton, who has been slated as the clean-up hitter in the Progressive fundamental transformation of America. 
It is for that reason that sitting this election out  refusing to vote because of the quality, demeanor, ethics or perceived personality deficits of the candidates  is an exercise of abdication of responsibility; to the country, future generations and the US Constitution. In the end, it is the most selfish thing an American can do at this point in American history. shares",english,2016-10-26T23:00:51.618+03:00,freedomoutpost.com,US,40480,"Like It Or Not, This Election Is A Referendum",0,http://freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vote.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Lets hope that it doesnt happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day＃ 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are very concerned. Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are very confident about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trumps star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax＃ 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trumps star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trumps star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June ＃ 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidates star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted Nazi Republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece＃ 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, Why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement? 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ＆some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back. Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a Blue Lives Matter shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if Donald Trump loses the election＃ 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, On November 8th, Im voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, Im grabbing my musket. You in? 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today ＃ 
Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, Ive been buying a lot more ammunition, says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigans Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clintons political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month ＃ 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it.

If you look at the numbers, there is no way that Hillary Clinton could possibly win the election without the support of a substantial percentage of evangelical Christian voters. In fact, if evangelical Christians stuck together they could pretty much elect whoever they want as president. According to the Pew Research Center, 35 percent of all adults in the United States identify themselves as evangelical or born again, and it has been estimated that there are 94 million evangelical Christian adults in this country. If evangelical Christians acted as a single voting block they could determine the outcome of every single presidential election. Unfortunately, that simply is not going to happen. 
A survey that was recently conducted by LifeWay Research found that only 45 percent of Christian evangelicals plan to vote for Donald Trump and 31 percent of Christian evangelicals plan to vote for Hillary Clinton. 
That same survey discovered that moral issues are becoming increasingly unimportant to evangelical voters＃ Overall, the economy is the top concern for Americans regardless of religious affiliation (30%). National security (17%) and personal character (17%) also are significant issues. Supreme Court nominees (10%), immigration (5%), religious freedom (2%), and abortion (1%) are less important . For churchgoers and those with evangelical beliefs, their pocketbook and personal safety are paramount, said McConnell. Moral issues arent a priority for many of them. 
I dont know how in the world abortion could come in at only 1 percent. Even if you add Supreme Court nominees and abortion together, you still only get a total of 11 percent. 
This just shows that evangelicals in America have their priorities way out of order. 
And unfortunately for Donald Trump, he is getting a lot less support from evangelicals than other recent presidential candidates received. According to the New York Times , previous candidates have generally received about 80 percent support from white evangelical voters, but Donald Trump is only getting about 65 to 70 percent support, and his numbers among non-white evangelicals are absolutely dismal. 
If you are an evangelical Christian and you have reservations about Donald Trump, I can respect that. But there will be other names on the ballot and you do not have to vote for Hillary Clinton. As I have said before, a vote for Hillary Clinton is an act of unmitigated wickedness. 
Hillary Clinton has made support for abortion one of the central pillars of her long political career. In fact, I dont know if there is any politician in America that is more associated with abortion than Hillary Clinton. Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, more than 58 million babies have been murdered in the United States, and Hillary Clintons hands are drenched with their blood. 
If you vote for Hillary Clinton, your hands will be drenched with their blood too. 
Needless to say, I am absolutely horrified that so many prominent evangelical leaders have come out in support of Hillary Clinton during this election season. For example, a group that represents over 6,000 Latino evangelical churches has just announced that they are endorsing Hillary Clinton ＃ 
An organization representing more than 6,000 Latino evangelical churches in the U.S. is endorsing Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. 
In a statement Thursday, the group OPEN USA says Clinton has proven her willingness to engage in difficult conversations, listen to contrasting opinions and engage faith leaders. 
Meanwhile, 75 evangelical leaders recently signed a petition on Change.org that strongly denounces Donald Trump＃ 
We, undersigned evangelicals, simply will not tolerate the racial, religious, and gender bigotry that Donald Trump has consistently and deliberately fueled, no matter how else we choose to vote or not to vote. 
One of the truly alarming trends that we have been seeing this election season is the number of prominent women in the evangelical movement that are openly rejecting Donald Trump and embracing Hillary Clinton. The following is a short excerpt from a recent Washington Post article that examined this phenomenon＃ 
When Jen Hatmaker speaks to stadiums full of Christian women, she regales them with stories about her five children and her garden back in Austin, Tex. 〞 and stays away from politics. But recently she took to Facebook and Instagram to blast Donald J. Trump as a national disgrace, and remind her legions of followers that there are other names on the ballot in November. 
And Christianity Today recently published an editorial from one of the top female evangelical leaders in the entire country in which she publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton. According to Christianity Today, Deborah Fikes is the former Permanent Representative to the United Nations for World Evangelical Alliance, which represents a constituency of 650 million with alliance offices in 129 countries. Fikes says that she stepped down from some of her leadership positions so that she could openly advocate for Clinton ＃ My recent resignations from evangelical leadership positions to endorse Hillary Clinton speaks volumes of how important I believe it is that she is elected in November. The toxic tone and atmosphere that surrounds Mr. Trump and is fueled among his supporters has done irreparable damage to not only our country and the future of the GOP but also to the public witness of evangelicals in America who are seen as some of his biggest supporters. There is no question in my mind or spirit that with the overwhelming challenges the next American president will face, Hillary Clinton is the most qualified person who has ever run for the Oval Office . On the issues of our national security, economic stability, seeing that healthcare reform continues to move forward, and tackling domestic challenges of poverty, inequality, and racism, we need her to be the person occupying this office. 
A lot of these women seem to think that abortion shouldnt be a major issue in this election, but that is like saying that the Holocaust shouldnt have been a major issue in Nazi Germany. 
Look, you dont have to vote for Donald Trump or anyone else to be a good Christian. 
But if you cast a vote for Hillary Clinton, you are casting a vote for the most evil, wicked and corrupt politician that this nation has possibly ever seen, and you are publicly endorsing the sinful positions that she is proud to stand for. 
I know that I have been writing about the election a lot lately , but I feel that it is very important that I do so. Most of the media coverage has focused on Donald Trump , but I feel that this election is far more about Hillary Clinton. The things that her and her husband have done have been well documented, and if the American people willingly choose her they will know exactly what they are doing. 
Unfortunately, not even Christians are standing united against the Clintons. The political divide in the evangelical Christian world has grown so deep that it has even reached Liberty University. The following comes from the Atlantic ＃ 
Thats why it was such a big deal when, two weeks ago, a group of Liberty students put out a letter explaining why theyre standing against the Republican presidential nominee. Jerry Falwell Jr., who has run the school since his father died in 2007, announced his support for Donald Trump back in January, and he has since spoken on the candidates behalf in interviews and at events. We are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwells endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history, the students wrote. Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him. 
Thousands of people signed onto the letter, including, the students said, roughly 2,000 students or alumni with liberty.edu email addresses.Dustin Wahl and Alex Forbes, two of the letters authors, were featured on MSNBC and CNN. They said they received supportive emails and tweets from Russell Moore, the head of the political arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, and Erick Erickson, the conservative radio-show host. 
And the support for Clinton is particularly strong among young adult evangelicals. When I read the following paragraph on the website of the New York Times , I was absolutely astounded＃ 
Kate Shellnutt, 30, the online editor of Christianity Today and editor of the CT Women section, said she had observed that the millennial generation has a lot less patience for Trump. Of the 33 influential millennial evangelicals she profiled for a cover story two years ago, she says she can now find only one, Lila Rose, who is pro-Trump, and even she has been publicly critical of him . Several have been using the hashtag #NeverTrump, Ms. Shellnutt said. 
The frightening thing is that this election might be the last chance for evangelical Christians to shape the political direction of this nation, because the truth is that demographics are rapidly shifting, and this includes the demographics of the evangelical community ＃ 
As Robert Jones has expertly documented in his recent book The End of White Christian America , the number of older, conservative, white male evangelicals is shrinking each year. Meanwhile, the number of younger evangelicals of all ethnic backgrounds 〞 whose moral and political views extend far beyond positions on gay marriage and abortion 〞 is on the rise. 
If you follow my work regularly, then you already know that I have very little hope for the future of America. 
But if Hillary Clinton is elected, there will be exactly zero hope. 
If evangelical Christians stood united, they could stop her, but at this point it appears that is not going to happen.

Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. 
Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News ＃ 
Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. 
The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. 
If anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election, then they arent paying much attention, Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. 
And without a doubt, voting locations are soft targets that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters ＃ 
There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didnt have 15 or 20 years ago, said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee.  What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then thats certainly concerning. 
All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. 
Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. 
Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania ＃ 
We dont want to lose an election because you know what Im talking about, Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. Because you know what? Thats a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places . 
And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats＃ 
Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. 
Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. 
I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent, Moynihan said. You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat. 
In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . 
Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation ＃ 
According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. 
The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation  apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007  when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? 
Either way, it doesnt look good. 
After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. 
But Democrats dont like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters＃ 
Its un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that , Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book  Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America , previously told The Christian Science Monitor. Voting was very, very dangerous. I dont think anyones suggesting that were at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic. 
Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. 
But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? 
If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed.

A bombshell of new audio is exposing Hillary Clinton for the immoral, politically motivated opportunist that she is. Now the question is, will this impact her race for the White House? 
Some ten years ago (more recent than Donald Trumps now infamous locker room talk recording) in September of 2006, Hillary Clinton was running for reelection to the Senate when she sat down to speak with the editorial board of the Jewish Press. The sit-down was recorded, but the full conversation had never been released, until now. One of the editors present during the interview spoke with the Observer this week and played them the 45-minute long tape of the conversation with Clinton. 
Below is what is likely the most important disclosure of the conversation, and it provides reason for American voters to worry. It also proves that Donald Trump is not some crazy conspiracy theorist for expressing concern about the Democrat Party trying to rig the 2016 election. 
While talking to the Jewish Press, Clinton commented on the 2006 election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (where terrorist organization Hamas won control of the Palestinian government) and expressed her belief that allowing the election was a huge mistake, but if they were going to allow it＃ then the US government should have rigged the election to suit their needs. 
I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. 
Yes, you just heard correctly. A sitting US Senator, and the future Secretary of State and then presidential candidate just argued that we should have rigged the election, thereby disallowing the right of the Palestinian people to choose their own leaders. 
While Hamas is a terrorist organization and they are horrible, murderous thugs whose ideology we must stamp out＃ the comments should raise this question in our minds  if Hillary Clinton is willing to rig an election in Palestine, why wouldnt she do the same here if she could? This realization that Clinton is not beyond fixing the results of an election, should make all of the other recent evidences of massive voter fraud all the more concerning. 
Well known election fraud expert John Fund has written article , after article , after article and even books chronicling voter fraud in the U.S. 
Fund wrote extensively, for instance, of the 2008 election that put Al Franken in the U.S. Senate for the State of Minnesota. The 312-vote victory Franken eked out, Fund wrote , was not a happy result of just enough votes but a result born of massive vote fraud. 
Other reporters have written of vote fraud, of course. Take the report in the Washington Free Beacon that revealed that 141 U.S. counties have more people registered to vote than they even have residents eligible to do so! 
These charges have been building for at least 20 years and over the last few months they have shifted into high gear. But we dont have to stick to recent history to find people complaining about voter fraud. Only eight years ago when he was first running for the White House, even Barack Obama was heard complaining about rampant vote fraud in the U.S＃ 
And then there is the new series of undercover videos by Jame OKeefes Project Veritas which has revealed Democrat operatives admitting that they routinely engage in voter fraud in order to win elections by hook or crook. 
Please make sure to read the full Observer story about the 2006 interview with Hillary Clinton. There are a few other remarkable observations made about some of Clintons comments  like her willingness to speak with world leaders no matter the current political climate between our countries and Clintons seeming approval of an eye for an eye interactions between Israel and Hamas.

Just when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clintons mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails did not come from her private server, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry, and according to some reports there may be potentially thousands of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? 
Lets take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ 
After recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that appear to be pertinent to the email probe. 
In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation, Comey wrote the chairmen. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. 
At this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clintons closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clintons Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ 
We dont know what this means yet except that its a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So thats where we are＃ 
Is it a certainty that we wont learn before the election? Im not sure its a certainty we wont learn before the election. 
One thing is, its possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ 
If the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? 
It is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. 
So those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. 
But if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ 
If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 
DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. 
But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. 
It would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. 
In such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be fair until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. 
Meanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. 
And CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ 
An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. 
MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. 
The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. 
Without Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. 
So if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. 
At this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.

The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint Friday against FBI Director James Comey with the Department of Justice, alleging interference with the 2016 presidential election. 
The coalition, an arm of the Keep America Great PAC, filed the complaint with the DOJs Office of Professional Responsibility, after Comey announced to Congress that because of new emails discovered on Huma Abedins electronic devices relevant to the Hillary Clinton email investigation, the agency would review those emails and assess their relevancy to the investigation. 
For Scott Dworkin, senior advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, the announcement is evidence that Comey, a registered Republican, is attempting to undermine Clintons chances of taking the White House. 
It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election, Dworkin said in a statement. It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton. 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump has filed numerous complaints with federal agencies about figures connected to the 2016 election. 
On Monday, the group filed a complaint with the FBI against Donald Trump himself for allegedly violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In other words, the group thinks Trump has called for voter intimidation and suppression on a national level. 
Earlier in October, the group also filed a complaint against the Trump campaign and political strategist Roger Stone, saying both were involved with WikiLeaks and also a foreign government behind the hacks that lead to the release of emails from John Podesta, Clintons campaign chair. 
Podesta referred to the FBIs Friday announcement as extraordinary. 
It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election, Podesta said . The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining. 
In July, after the FBI came to a conclusion on Clintons private email server and said that no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with criminal charges, the Clinton campaign praised Comey as a well-respected Republican who served as George W. Bushs Deputy Attorney General. 
Brian Fallon, press secretary for the Clinton campaign, shamed Republicans in September , particularly GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, for trying to bully the FBI into serving partisan interests.

You wouldnt know it by watching the news, but there are actually important things going on in the world that have nothing to do with the Presidential election. Today, well talk about some of these non-election-related events on Survival Saturday, like the Dakota access pipeline, Russia, Venezuela, and our dystopian future. 
For election coverage, go on over to my other website, DaisyLuther.com , which is all Hillary, all the time, right up until the election. (My goal there is to cover the stuff that the MSM is trying to sweep under the rug about their darling.) The Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters Are Being Brutally Attacked by Law Enforcement 
Have you been aware of the ongoing protests by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe about a pipeline being forcibly built across their watershed via eminent domain? They have been joined by other tribes to form a coalition of water protectors who say that the pipeline is a violation of a treaty established between the Sioux and the federal government. ( Here are the important things to know about the protest . Trust me, youll want to read this.) 
Everyone who was paying attention breathed a sigh of relief when the US Government for once took a stand on behalf of the little guys back in September. 
The federal government ordered a halt to work on a $3.8 billion four-state oil pipeline in the Upper Midwest on Friday, handing a temporary victory to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other opponents of the project＃ 
＃The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it wouldnt authorize construction near Lake Oahe, a culturally important location to the tribe, until the agency determines if it needs to reconsider its previous approvals under the National Environmental Policy Act. ( source ) 
Unfortunately, the governments willingness to do the right thing was short-lived. Work has resumed on the pipeline and all hell is breaking loose  but not by who you might think. Protestors have been non-violent, but law enforcement has been absolutely brutal. Theyve beaten up on young people, old people, and independent journalists covering the story. Hundreds have been arrested. 
These people are protecting their water sources and their way of life, and they are being brutalized by our own government. The story youre getting on the mainstream is that the water protectors are standing there and that the police are standing there and that it is a relatively calm affair. 
That couldnt be further from the truth. The AntiMedia (who would get a major journalism award if real journalists got such awards) has provided truthful coverage, and it is ugly. Every single person who is against government overreach should be supporting the water protectors. Right now, this affects some people up in North Dakota. But what about when someone wants to build something across your land? What about when someone wants to seize your home? What about when Agenda 21 comes to your back yard? 
Heres what really happened at the Dakota Access Pipeline protests . Its on film. Its ugly. You owe it to your fellow human beings to witness this and be outraged. Go here to learn what you can do to help . With all of this progress, is humanity at risk of becoming obsolete? 
Thousands of jobs each year are being turned over to computers as humans demand higher wages and better benefits for unskilled labor. Weve all ended up on the endless loop of talking to customer service robots on the phone or going to a checkout counter and discovering it is push button and digital. 
Is this all part of a greater plan to make the bulk of humanity utterly dependent on the whims of a few? 
I dont watch a lot of documentaries, but last night my daughter and I watched Obsolete . This film is available for free on Amazon , and it isnt one of those dry, boring ones that keep you shifting in your seat in order to stay awake. Its fascinating from the moment you hit play. When it was over, we sat there in silence for at least a minute, aghast that we could see the whole thing happening around us right now. 
I cant recommend this highly enough. Everyone should watch it. Let me quote Morpheus (from the Matrix ) for a moment here. This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill〞the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill〞you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all Im offering is the truth. Nothing more. 
This documentary is the red pill. Take it if you want to survive the future that is coming for us all. 
Watch Obsolete then come back over here and lets talk about it. I think this will spark a very interesting conversation. How will you prepare for a future in which humanity is largely obsolete? Meanwhile in Venezuela＃ 
Things are still awful there, although there hasnt been as much news coverage. Basically, this is how life is now for Venezuelans, and recovering from this collapse could take decades. 
Currently, the people of the country are revolting against the unpopular president, Nicholas Maduro. A campaign had begun for a recall election in order to replace Maduro, but authorities halted the process. The electoral council cited fraud when faced with huge numbers of signatures on a petition. Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets. Source: Federico Parra /AFP/Getty Images 
NPR reports : 
The demonstrators were protesting what they call a sharp turn towards authoritarianism. The Maduro government has jailed opposition leaders, stripped Congress of its powers and cracked down on the press. 
As for Maduro, he has blatantly threatened to jail anyone who tries to remove him from power, via elections or legal means, ironically citing the Venezuelan constitution : 
If they launch a supposed political trial, which is not in our constitution, the state prosecution service must bring legal action in the courts and put in jail anyone who violates the constitution, even if they are members of Congress. 
Whats more, in a conversation with the American DEA, Maduros nephew says that Venezuela is at war with the US, which is news to most Americans. Efrain Campo was busted doing a quick cocaine deal in order to make money for the Venezuelan First Family. He was caught attempting to smuggle $5 million of Columbian cocaine into the US. The Charlotte Observer reported : 
Efrain Campo＃was recorded saying were at war with the Americans and laughing about sending opposition leaders to jail, according to the transcript, which was filed in federal district court in New York. 
We need the money, Campo said, according to the transcript. Why? Because the Americans are hitting us hard with money. Do you understand? The opposition . . . is getting an infusion of a lot of money. 
＃The defense has sought to paint Campo and his cousin as victims of a U.S. political plot against the Venezuelan government and has asserted that they didnt have the knowledge or capability to pull off such a complicated transaction. Were irritating the snot out of Russia＃ 
Lately, the Powers That Shouldnt Be (great phrase borrowed from my friend Mel at Truthstream Media ) have been going out of their way to paint Russia and Vladimir Putin as the biggest threat to America. A bigger threat, even, than Hillary Clinton, and boy, thats a stretch. Im pretty sure you can put all of these recent headlines together and get a picture of where this is headed. ( Hint .)

What happens when you get thousands of lawyers involved in the craziest election in modern American history? Unfortunately, we may be about to find out. We all remember the legal tug of war between Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000, and with each passing day it is becoming more likely that we could see something similar (or even worse) in 2016. In a brand new article entitled  Clinton, Trump Prepare for Possibility of Election Overtime , Bloomberg discusses the armies of lawyers that Clinton and Trump are both assembling for this election. It would be nice if it was the American people that actually decided the outcome of this election, but if things are very close on November 8th it may come down to what the courts decide. 
Traditionally, there has been a lot of pressure on the losing candidate to concede to the winning candidate before election night is over. 
However, in recent elections this has begun to change. I already mentioned what took place in the aftermath of the 2000 election, and in 2004 John Kerry did not concede to George W. Bush until the next morning. 
And looking back at the numbers from the 2012 election, it is clear that Mitt Romney should not have conceded the race to Barack Obama so early. There was evidence of election fraud in key battleground states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado and Virginia , and many people out there still believe that Mitt Romney would have won if the election would have been conducted fairly. 
So when Donald Trump says that he may not immediately concede the election if the results are tight, I think that there is wisdom in that. 
A couple of weeks ago, it looked like we may have had a situation where Hillary Clinton could have won by a landslide . But the FBI changed everything when they announced that they were renewing their investigation into Hillary Clintons emails. Since that announcement, the poll numbers have been rapidly shifting and now Trump has all of the momentum . 
For example, the ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll had Hillary Clinton up by double digits not too long ago, but now it is showing a one point lead for Trump . 
The race is very close at this point, and if the race to 270 electoral votes is razor tight on election night, I dont anticipate that either candidate will be eager to concede. We could see a prolonged legal battle ensue, and that could mean that we dont have a new president until long after election day is over. 
Already, both campaigns are assembling large armies of lawyers. In fact, Bloomberg is reporting that Clinton already has thousands of lawyers that have donated their time to her campaign＃ 
Clinton is assembling a voter protection program that has drawn thousands of lawyers agreeing to lend their time and expertise in battleground states, though the campaign isnt saying exactly how many or where. It is readying election observers in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada and Arizona to assess any concerns 〞 including the potential for voter intimidation 〞 and to verify normal procedures. 
The Republican National Lawyers Association, which trains attorneys in battleground states and in local jurisdictions where races are expected to be close, aims to assemble 1,000 lawyers ready to monitor polls and possibly challenge election results across the country. Hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, one of Trumps biggest backers, has sunk $500,000 into the group, its biggest donation in at least four presidential elections, Internal Revenue Service filings show. 
And most Americans dont realize this, but Reuters is reporting that the Democrats have already filed election-related lawsuits in four key swing states＃ 
Democratic Party officials sued Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in four battleground states on Monday, seeking to shut down a poll-watching effort they said was designed to harass minority voters in the Nov. 8 election . 
In lawsuits filed in federal courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona and Ohio, Democrats argued that Trump and Republican Party officials were mounting a campaign of vigilante voter intimidation that violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and an 1871 law aimed at the Ku Klux Klan. 
Meanwhile, the legal challenges for the Clinton campaign continue to mount. The renewed investigation into Hillary Clintons mishandling of classified documents is just one of five FBI investigations that are currently looking into the conduct of Clintons inner circle ＃ 
There are, in fact, not one but five separate FBI investigations which involve members of Clintons inner circle or their closest relatives  the people at the center of what has come to be known as Clintonworld. 
The five known investigations are into: Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedins estranged husband sexting a 15-year-old; the handling of classified material by Clinton and her staff on her private email server; questions over whether the Clinton Foundation was used as a front for influence-peddling; whether the Virginia governor broke laws about foreign donations; and whether Hillarys campaign chairmans brother did the same. 
Despite everything that we already know about Hillary, about half the country still plans to vote for her. 
If the American people willingly choose to elect the most corrupt presidential candidate in our history, it may be a sign that the events that I talk about in my new book are a lot closer than many people had originally been anticipating. 
But the good news is that a Clinton victory is looking a whole lot less likely than it was just a week or two ago. 
Could it be possible that the FBI has just delivered the  miracle  that Donald Trump desperately needed? 
Americans are more emotionally invested in this presidential campaign than they have been in any presidential campaign since at least 1980. Many of those that are backing Trump will be emotionally devastated if he does not win on November 8th, but if Trump does win we are likely to see the radical left throw a political temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. 
Earlier today, I shared with my readers the amazing fact that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old during his first full day in the White House if he wins the election. 
Many conservatives are fully convinced that it is Donald Trumps destiny to be president. 
Personally, I do not know what is going to happen. But with a race this close, it may be the courts that end up deciding who our next president is, and that is an outcome that none of us should want to see.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been criticized for his response as to whether hed accept 2016 election results. His exact words: Ill keep you in suspense. Several pundits think that statement cost him the election. But read more broadly, the way the subliminal mind does, and his response was brilliant, revealing his astute instincts emanating from the newly discovered unconscious super intelligence (which we all possess). 
His word suspense implies an unfolding drama. Indeed, the depth of this drama is immeasurable. But Trumps telling America a secret story. 
His story is told through his super intelligence which quick reads situations before telling what it perceives between the lines. Trumps super-intel is naturally attuned to other persons subconscious confessions. They do so in the symbolic language of protests too much denial and log in your eye projection along with other key imagery. 
His super-intel quick reads Hillary Clinton and the media and conveys his response indirectly in code. 
Theres far more to the medias insistence that Trump was violating rules by not accepting election results. The media asked, Are you going to play by the rules of prior presidential candidates? But the big picture behind this election focuses on presidents playing by the rules, specifically the rule of law. 
Unconsciously, Trumps answer implied that the candidacy of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, raises serious rule of law questions. 
For two weeks the media harangued Trump complaining hed not played by societys accepted rules of sexual conduct. That criticism continued while they ignored Hillarys longtime enabling of her husbands abusive sexual behavior and her documented harassment of his victims as well as her own sexual escapades. The media wanted to turn this sexual matter into the central rule of law issue while a far more important rule of law issue regarding the nations foundation still sits on the table. 
As Roger L. Simon of pjmedia.com wrote on March 23, 2016, The very backbone of our country was the rule of law. Without [it]＃ America as we know it does not exist. Simon declared Americans must be convinced that the FBI investigation of Hillary Clintons email matter was handled justly and that Obama dare not interfere. Neither condition was satisfied. Obama avowed long before the Department of Justice ruled that Hillary was innocent. 
Then FBI Director James Comey in July 2016 detailed many of Hillarys rule of law violations and in a denial confession〞reading through his protests too much〞revealed she should have been prosecuted although Comey lacked the courage to see it through. (On October 28 th under pressure from newly discovered emails he reopened the investigation.) 
As Simon warned, Democrats nominated an illegal candidate who should have been tried for breaking the law. Trump reiterated that Hillary shouldnt have been allowed to run. 
Trump also reading Obamas law-breaking Yet theres a deeper, far more powerful story Trump unconsciously hints at 〞one which terrifies Democrats and the entire political class. 
Trump demonstrates his subtle super-intel instincts. Hes far ahead of the medias conscious take. Deep down, Trump focused on Barack Obama who facilitated Hillary Clintons violation of the law in her email scandal. 
Trump alludes to a far more significant rule of law issue. His super-intel continues asking the greatest question regarding the legality of any presidential election in U.S. history: the question of Obamas citizenship in 2008 and 2012. 
From 2008 to 2015, Donald Trump stood strong, demonstrating presidential-type leadership by insisting on respect for the Constitution. He questioned Obamas failure to produce evidence of legal U.S. citizenship. When Obama produced his alleged birth certificate under pressure in 2011, Trump was aware that Sheriff Joe Arpaios panel of document examiners declared it a phony . 
The media buried the issue. Reporters abused millions of Americans, including Trump, by labeling them racist conspiracy theorists〞a basic projection reflecting that the PC media was itself enabling the Obama conspiracy at the expense of our Constitution. 
Dont believe Trumps no longer a birther. Only recently, to avoid media harassment, did he claim that he accepted Obamas U.S. citizenship. But besides the birth issue, Trump saw that Obama continually functioned as an illegal president . To Americas detriment he repeatedly violated laws on a whim, for example by ignoring immigration laws. 
When Obama continually neglected to protect Americas national security, Trump confronted him. Trump recognized Obama had increasingly enabled Islamic terrorists while simultaneously building up terrorist Iran, even giving them a nuclear bomb on a layaway plan and cash money to boot. 
Following the June 11, 2016 Orlando massacre perpetrated by an Islamic terrorist, Trump confronted Obama, observing that Obama wouldnt identify the enemy〞call them by their name, Islamic terrorists〞and Trump suggested Obama unconsciously knew the many reasons he should resign the presidency. 
On the surface, Obama became enraged, but unconsciously Trump elicited from Obama the most shocking confession imaginable. Secretly Obama wants the truth known. 
On the heels of Trumps challenge, Obama explained between the lines of two speeches on June 12 and 14, that he was truly a mind-controlled Stockholm Syndrome prisoner of radical Islam, programmed at an early age in his own home. 
The decoded details are described in my book, The Stockholm Syndrome President, How Trump Triggered Obamas Hidden Confession . 
As he intuitively put together the story of his life, Obama learned the horrifying family secret that his Muslim father had wanted him aborted. 
(My scientific forensic profiling approach confirmed that Obamas super-intel imagery pointed toward a near abortion which matched his lifes circumstances including a promiscuous 17 year-old mother unexpectedly pregnant from a casual affair.) 
His father had also emotionally killed him by abandoning him. Obama felt that pain on a daily basis, and then he learned that his father physically abused his mother and two later wives in Kenya. 
The near-death by abortion and constant death experience at the hands of his anti-American Muslim father became fixated in Obamas mind. He became frozen in terror〞suffering a deep early-childhood trauma〞terrified that his father would kill him at any moment. 
When he was a child, his father was radical Islam to him〞both one and the same. To stay alive Obama became an unconscious Stockholm Syndrome victim controlled by Islam〞explaining his repeated capitulations to them as president and his curious refusal to use that term. 
Obamas Stockholm Syndrome remains buried deep in his psyche. Only his unconscious super-intel can tell his story in its psycholinguistic language. In his recent speeches, he unknowingly confessed in key images such as doing the terrorists work for them or key denials then the terrorists would win. Im not going to let that happen. 
But Obama further confessed in his June 14 speech, that he was programmed as a radical Islam mole to carry out a major robbery from America〞 first by stealing the rule of law and running as an illegal president. 
In fact, Obama has robbed America in many ways: economically with massive debt and hampering business; robbed us of our borders with massive illegal immigration; of gains in racial harmony; of safe communities, of police safety, of inner city safety, of affordable health care, of military power and of our world leadership role. All the while his policies have strengthened terrorist Iran and radical Islam. 
Now return to Trumps threatened refusal to accept the election results. Consider his brilliant super-intel message to the media: You keep America in suspense about how you avoid the rule of law both with Hillary Clinton and especially Obama, and I will keep you in suspense as to what Ill do about it. 
Consciously Trump may not yet fully appreciate his deeper plans, but he hints at them strongly. 
If Trump wins he could appoint a special committee of document examiners to study Obamas birth certificate. As Obama and Clinton have reversed themselves on gay marriage, Trump could simply change his mind about the need to clarify Obamas birthplace. 
But if Trump loses he could still rise to the occasion by putting rule of law money behind a renewed investigation. He could potentially mobilize an abused citizenry. Rule of law Americans could demand Congress take action and legally obtain Obamas birth records〞as Obama himself, the traumatized child, has unconsciously encouraged. Obamas super-intel, like Trumps and all others, fully espouses the rule of law. And the need for America to re-embrace its moral compass is the most significant story of the election of 2016.

By Vekar 
One thing I have yet to see anyone bring up is how this election could be bait and switch at the last minute. In order to understand this however I need to explain the unique possibilities the NWO has created with these two candidates and how this is in fact a very old card from the 1900s. 
First we have Trump, everyone loves Trump because Trump is not Hillary, therefore he must be better, it is an argument based on the following: Stalin killed 47 million and one while Mao killed 47 million and TWO so Stalin is better than Mao! Trump is outright the lets go back to sleep candidate, Hillary is not. Already I have seen and heard more than enough about how if only Trump goes in then at least four more years have been bought and the nation will survive juts four more years. 
From the so called militia and patriots at AWRM and the Intelligence Report they yammer that if only Trump goes in then we can POSTPONE the coming war or buy ourselves more time to prepare, after all, they claim time favors us not the enemy. All this bearing in mind that Trump has gone back on his word many times, changed his mind, flip flopped on illegals, wants a bigger police state, is the most hated in the media, etc. Now lets compare the next runner up quickly. 
Hillary, it is currently chic to hate Hillary, youre not in style if you like her, she will end the nation, doom the world and so on. Never mind that both Trump and Hillary were put up by the NWO, you are not allowed to run otherwise, this is old news. She is going to cause more war, she is a liar, cheat, she betrayed the nation, etc. Yet both her and Trump met with Netanyahu behind closed doors and apparently received his blessing to proceed, it is a trap and we should all know it and see it clearly. She is also the darling of the media. 
Both of them have in common the 1900s rise to power theme of Lenin and Hitler, both take after these two for both nations (Germany and Russia) were in collapse or outright collapsed, debauchery was the rule as well as corruption. Hillary is like Lenin, she is going in red banners flying and the Cheka on her heels to remove any undesirables. She is going to finish the job and push the agenda to the hilt even if it takes war to do it. Trump on the other hand is following Hitlers script, offering hope without promising anything except a bigger government, more powerful police state, etc. Trump will also see the plan to fruition but there is a subtle nuance between these two: one is offering to do it with an iron fist in a velvet glove the other is simply the iron fist. 
Now comes the problem people are not seeing: if they force Hillary in despite all the public outrage then we know for a fact they have reached a level of preparation that is adequate to dealing with public backlash, even insurrection should it be minor or full. If they put Trump in then they are taking the back street approach because they have not gathered the resources yet to put us down and need to put someone in who will quiet the public just like Obama did for a time. This election is about purchasing time; nothing more, nothing less. 
If Trump is put in then already we can see that most are going straight back to bed and not getting up for another four years at minimum, maybe eight. The militias and other patriot groups will declare a partial victory and that they can bury their guns again and whistle Dixie. They are mortified of having to take action so Trump is their obvious choice. Hillary on the other hand represents that steamroller coming down the hill at full tilt, they do not want that and seek to avoid it rather than fight it. The reality is time does NOT favor us here, time favors the enemy. If time favored us then we would not be here, diminished and in dire straits. Imagine how much could have been avoided had the militia stood up during Waco, again time favored the enemy. Ruby Ridge? Time favored the enemy as they whittle away and build their power base up bit by bit. They are not fools. 
Consider those two possibilities then consider this: If Trump goes in and goes along with the war with Russia if indeed that is the plan for WW3 they laid out more than SIXITY years ago admittedly, people are FAR more willing to join Trumps army and go fight than they would Hillary. Something else to consider is perhaps they want a second civil war. Put Hillary in KNOWING it will cause an insurrection, fake one which we know they can do＃ Have Trump reluctantly take the reins and like Davis lead the way in marching the fools single file into the enemy guns just like the first one causing mass casualties for nothing. A second civil war of this sort would favor the enemy for it would absolutely end the nation, but who would fight for Hillary? Oh right, THATS why they are bringing in all those foreigners and foreign troops! Just change the uniform quickly and voila! Some would suggest this would favor the American Nationals＃ Not really, rather than fight intelligently for the Bill of Rights they would be fighting for TRUMP! They would be fighting to bleed us dry like the Confederates did in the civil war fighting by the rules and it cost them dearly. Only by fighting by OUR OWN RULES can we win, Trump would allow them to guide the slaughter one way or another all the while weakening us. Remember, the end game is to destroy ABSOLUTELY the last vestiges of Americans and our culture, whatever may be left of it, which is not much if anything. 
Perhaps the above is where those warning about the coming breakup of America will occur, perhaps, perhaps not, but they now have the OPTION to do so! I want you to think on all this and let your mind run wild with other possibilities, but just remember that they are right now lining the ducks up (you) while the firing squad is forming up and loading their rifles. No matter WHAT you believe will be the outcome of this and no matter what happens one way or another know that this is all preplanned and they would NEVER allow this situation unless they had a humdinger of a plan hidden just beneath the surface, I hope I scratched that surface for you. Like you, they have a plan A, B, C and D, it is why they have succeeded for more than two centuries! Do not take them for the fool, they have proven they are not. 
So maybe we will get Trump and the populace will quiet down while the communists march on with a different uniform, Cheka versus Gestapo. Then again Hillary might go in and just finish things and be done with it or prep the nation for the next phase. No matter what happens, be ready for it and do not let them sucker you into believing this honest or that TRUMP is honest! They are both in on it together! They merely represent two different paths for them to reach their ultimate goal!

Congress overwhelmingly voted for the Patriot Act nearly 16 years ago, and our civil liberties have never been the same since. As if this singular bill, passed by George W. Bush, wasnt invasive enough, allowing big banks to demand our internet data, and more 〞 the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act ( CISA ) makes cyber-spying by the shadow government and the financial entities controlling it, a forgone conclusion. 
As with most shadow government legislation, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act is packed with hidden surveillance allowances. CISA was quietly passed to allow government to demand that private companies hand over personal information to them at will. It also allows companies to mine data, under the auspices of government-created urgency. 
The mere fact that this act passed in late 2015 is monumental, since it has been before Congress in different forms for over a decade . The election seems to have offered the perfect cover, as Americans and activists were too busy arguing over Trump vs. Hillary. 
Scott Talbott, senior vice president of government relations at the Electronic Transactions Association believes the value of sharing our personal data as a means to be alerted of ＆cyber threats outweighs any hazard to our civil liberties. Talbott states , 
The value is that everyone can be alerted to cyber threats and take precautionary countermeasures before they materialize and spread, he said. Before CISA, corrective measures could be taken only after the cyber threat had done its damage. CISA allows each company to serve as an early warning system to the entire economy. 
Who exactly would be determining if someone is a ＆threat is the meat of the sandwich, though. CISA is ripe for abuse, just as the Patriot Act has been. 
The Patriot Act has made it legal for law enforcement to spy on people, without probable cause  to enter their homes, or even to strip search them before theyve been to court, had the opportunity to argue a case, or given ＆authorities a motive for this type of interrogation. 
The stated purpose of the Patriot Act was to deter terrorist acts in the United States, but what do you do when the terrorists have already taken over your country? CISA simply expands the reach of a shadow government which has already been proven to reach beyond the boundaries of constitutional law. 
More importantly, who specifically is CISA targeting? After multiple hack-ers have in-filt-rated com-puter sys-tems at the White House , the State De-part-ment , the Pentagon , and the Of-fice of Per-son-nel Man-age-ment, along with the Democratic National Committee , and numerous multinational banks run by the cabal, is the shadow government simply trying to create a stop-gap before their most elusive, yet damning information is made public? 
CISA certainly will expand the reach of government surveillance on citizens as it has been conducted by the the National Security Agency (NSA) before former NSA contractor Edward Snowden exposed it. 
I think this bill was meant to be a surveillance bill from the start, said Justin Harvey, CSO of Fidelis Cybersecurity, adding that he is dubious that the stated intent of the bill  to use collective intelligence to warn of potential cyber attacks and possibly stop them before they occur  will result. 
Under the guise of ＆sharing cyber threats CISA allows companies to wholesale-collect information that may not even be a threat  and then pass it along for government bodies to determine if it is, indeed a threat. If this sounds like circular logic  it is just the beginning of the odd verbiage within the bill. Its justifications for entering every possible orifice for data-gathering are more confounded than an octopus in a straight jacket. 
The government can already enter your personal property including your home, your body , your cell, and your computer , but now they will have a legal in-roads to declare you a cyber-threat, simply for sending an email . This begs the question  who is the real cyber-bully? CISA seems to be nothing more than a prevarication, covering the acts of an elite few who dont want their secrets exposed. About the Author

Just when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clintons mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails did not come from her private server, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry, and according to some reports there may be potentially thousands of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? 
Lets take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ 
After recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that appear to be pertinent to the email probe. 
In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation, Comey wrote the chairmen. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. 
At this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clintons closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clintons Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ 
We dont know what this means yet except that its a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So thats where we are＃ 
Is it a certainty that we wont learn before the election? Im not sure its a certainty we wont learn before the election. 
One thing is, its possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ 
If the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? 
It is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. 
So those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. 
But if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ 
If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 
DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. 
But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. 
It would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. 
In such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be fair until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. 
Meanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. 
And CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ 
An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. 
MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. 
The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. 
Without Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. 
So if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. 
At this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.",english,2016-10-30T03:13:52.497+02:00,fromthetrenchesworldreport.com,US,,Will Barack Obama Delay Or Suspend The Election If Hillary Is Forced Out By The New FBI Email Investigation?,0,http://www.fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/images/default-user-image.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Democrat Hillary Clinton personally authorized illegal dirty tricks operations against Republican Donald Trumps campaign, according to top Democrats appearing in undercover video. 
In the third Hillary-related video released by ACORN slayer James OKeefe and his Project Veritas Action Fund this past Sunday (Oct. 23), Clinton is directly implicated in a scheme to use Donald Duck to mock Trump and troll his supporters at Trump campaign rallies. 
Among Disney cartoon characters Donald Duck was a natural choice. After all, his name used to appear regularly on voter registration documents when Bill and Hillary Clintons favorite community organizing group, the now-defunct ACORN, hired hobos and felons to go on voter-registration drives. 
Earlier this year Democrats in Donald Duck costumes started appearing at Trump events across America. Costumed individuals would walk around carrying signs. One said, Trump ducks releasing his tax return. 
This cutesy publicity stunt isnt necessarily the problem, though. The problem is that Hillary Clinton ordered it and apparently broke the law by coordinating with a tax-exempt nonprofit group. 
Prominent in the video is political organizer Robert Creamer who is very high up in the Democratic Partys hierarchy. He has reportedly visited the Obama White House 342 times, including 47 meetings with Obama personally. 
One of the visits took place in Obamas personal living quarters. 
Its a very big deal that Creamer visited the presidents residence in the White House, a former senior White House employee told FrontPage in an interview. White House employees can work there for years and never visit the residence. 
Creamer, a practitioner of the agitation arts taught by Marxist community organizing guru Saul Alinsky, is husband tof Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a socialist and advocate of single-payer health care. Creamer is considered by many to be the legislative architect of Obamacare. He also wrote a series of bad checks to cover his salary at a nonprofit and went to prison. Prosecutors wanted to send him up the river for 37 months but he got off with merely five months and 11 months of home confinement from a friendly Democrat judge. 
Creamer is a founder of the unsavory political consulting firm Democracy Partners . The list of partners on the companys website is a whos who of elite Democratic Party power players. 
In addition to Creamer, the partners are: 
Midwest Academy founder Heather Booth ; website developer Marc Cerabona ; organizer Wyatt Closs ; SEIU veteran Mac DAlessandro ; Maccabee Group founder Brett C. Di Resta ; CrossCurrents Foundation co-founder Ken Grossinger ; former Media Matters for America online organizer David Grossman ; former SEIU national field director for politics John Hennelly ; strategic communications advisor Marilyn Katz ; organizer Jackie Kendall ; strategist Lupe Lopez ; political consultant Mike Lux ; strategic advisor Josie Mooney ; consultant Patrick Pannett ; organizer Christine Pelosi (her mother is House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi); USAction president Khalid Pitts ; former DNC general counsel Joe Sandler ; consultant Linda Saucedo ; fundraiser Renee Schaeffer ; former New Organizing Institute senior fellow Joel Silberman ; and organizer Cheri Whiteman . 
Listed as associates are Lauren Windsor , executive director of American Family Voices, and Aaron Black , who appears in the undercover videos. Black describes himself in the footage as basically deputy rapid response director for the DNC on the ground at Trump events, adding nobodys supposed to know about me. 
(FrontPage published an article yesterday examining Democracy Partners.) 
For a master practitioner of fascistic tactics, Creamer is amazingly lacking in self-awareness (or just plain dishonest). He wrote a fatuous, ahistorical op-ed in the Huffington Post earlier this year titled Can Fascism Triumph in America? 
Like other fascist movements, Trump says out loud -- and legitimates -- the kind of hateful, violent language that was previously whispered only in the privacy of people's living rooms. 
Bear in mind that quite apart from his mischaracterization of Trumps public statements, Creamer is shown in the videos masterminding an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents. 
Fomenting and carrying out acts of violence against political opponents was what the fascist Third Reich did, using the Sturmabteiling or S.A., also called brown shirts and storm troopers. Ditto for Mussolinis Squadristi (black shirts), Maos Red Guards, Irans Basij , and Haitis Tonton Macoute . 
Creamer explains the Donald Duck action in the third video. 
In the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground, Creamer says in one of several exchanges. So, by God, we would get ducks on the ground. 
Creamer makes it clear he knows that this coordination between his consulting firm, Democracy Partners, and the campaign was a huge legal landmine when he said: Dont repeat that to anybody. 
The whole duck thing? That came about, the reason we moved it from DNC to [Americans United for Change] was to just do a hopscotch, but the actual idea was hatched way back in May, Creamer associate Scott Foval said, making a pun. 
The duck has to be an Americans United for Change entity, Creamer said. This had to do only with some problem between [now acting DNC chief] Donna Brazile and ABC, which is owned by Disney, because they were worried about a trademark issue. Thats why. Its really silly. 
We originally launched this duck because Hillary Clinton wants the duck. In any case, so she really wanted this duck figure out there doing stuff, so that was fine. So, we put all these ducks out there and got a lot of coverage. And Trump taxes. And then ABC/Disney went crazy because they thought our original slogan was ＆Donald ducks his taxes, releasing his tax returns. 
Creamer is shown in the video hoping Disney would file a lawsuit against Democrats for using Donald Duck in the campaign, likely because such a thing would generate publicity. 
Let them sue us. Please God, he says, looking to the heavens and clasping his hands together as if in prayer. I doubt they will because were paying to rent or buy the suits, thats where they get their license fees. Were not using it for commercial purposes. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Aug. 18 that ＆Donald ducks was the creation of the Democratic National Committee. Then on Sept. 8 the paper reported the DNC is no longer associated with the duck ＃ Americans United for Change is now managing the duck ＃ 
But out of public view the DNC and the Clinton campaign were still controlling the duck operation, breaking federal campaign coordination laws, OKeefe says in narrating the third video. 
We kind of divvy up responsibilities. So sometimes it will be, like, campaign owned, said Jenna Price, assistant press secretary at the DNC. So sometimes you will see that they advised something, or they are taking credit for things. So, like, we arent taking credit for the duck anymore. Thats like, random ally groups. But its still something that were involved in. 
Brad Woodhouse, president of Americans United for Change, expected the presence of the duck at events would spark violence. I think this duck is going to get roughed up somewhere. 
In one segment, Foval says, I almost got punched on Monday morning, I mean, I was in a duck costume. 
The nations campaign coordination laws were enacted after President Richard Nixons Watergate scandal, OKeefe notes. 
For an activity to violate the law it must meet a three-part test, he explains. 
First, there must be payment by someone other than the candidate for election-related activity. Second, a campaign has to be materially involved in shaping communications for a third party group. And third, electoral advocacy has to take place close to an election. 
OKeefe continues: 
The payment [prong of the test] is complicated but just the fact that Foval, a paid employee of Americans United for Change, was the duck at some events constitutes payment by AUfC. Conduct, based on their own admission the campaign, Creamer, their agent, and AUfC coordinated the duck activities. And finally content. ＆Donald ducks is undeniably political content directed against one candidate for the sole purpose of helping another. 
The fourth video, released yesterday, isnt so much an expose of wrongdoing but it does provide ample evidence of Creamers ties to the Clinton campaign and to President Obama himself. 
In a phone call Creamer says I spend most of my time overseeing the Trump events around the country. I mean, thats what I do for the Clinton campaign, uh, so thats interesting as well. 
In another scene when an undercover reporter phones saying he needs an immigration lawyer with powerful connections for a wealthy client in Syria, Creamer makes it clear he is happy to help by reaching out to Obama's inner circle. 
I just need to, I will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then. Okay? ＃ On the first, well, Ill just talk, the guy Im going to talk to first, to see if this is up his alley, the first thing is up his alley. Its the guy who ran the campaign for President Obama. He has a firm thats pretty well connected. 
In another setting, Creamer says: 
Heres what I do for the Clinton campaign by the way. Im a consultant to the Clinton campaign. Wherever Trump or Pence go in the country, we make sure that there are press events in the TV market or whatever ＃ whether theyre big turnouts or little turnouts, whatever, that drive our message wherever the candidate goes to drive his message. So that on any given day they will be between them probably in six places. So our team makes sure there are events in all those six places every day. So it is a lot of events, and we try and help define the other candidate. 
Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters, added Creamer. 
He continued: 
Im in this campaign mainly to deal with what, you know, earned media, with the television, radio. With earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising. There would be a whole different advertising ＃ everybody is driven on the same tracks, though. So then there are a couple, a bunch of people in the Brooklyn office [of the Clinton campaign] that are responsible for possible aspects of communication. Like, we do rapid response and there is a guy there I work with heavily, is the guy that I was just communicating with on that kind of stuff. For instance, we just found, I just sent him a note beforehand when we came here that said, ＆My understanding is there might be another revelation of another woman talking about Trump this afternoon. 
Creamer bragged again about his ties to President Obama. 
Oh Barack Obamas was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect. 
Obama is a pro, Creamer said. Ive known the president since he was a community organizer in Chicago. 
I was just at an event with him in Chicago actually, on Friday last. He is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the, the health care bill, trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues. 
The second video , released Oct. 18, was a primer on how Democrats get away with massive voter fraud. 
Its a very easy thing for Republicans to say, well theyre bussing people in, said Scott Foval, then national field director for Americans United for Change. 
Well you know what? Weve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin assholes for 50 years and were not going to stop now  were just going to find a different way to do it. So, I mean I grew up with that idea. They used to bus people out to Iowa. If we needed people out there wed bus people out to Iowa. 
In a discussion OKeefe described as focusing on bringing people from one state to another state to vote illegally, Foval, who also worked as deputy political director at George Soros-funded People for the American Way (PfAW), explains how to get away with voter fraud. 
Instead of bussing people in, it is better to have them travel in their own personal vehicles, he said. 
Would they charge each individual of voter fraud? Or are they going to go after the facilitator for conspiracy, which they could prove? Its one thing if all these people drive up in their personal cars. If theres a bus involved? That changes the dynamic. 
Its the legality, because you can prove conspiracy if theres a bus, he said. If there are cars its much harder to prove ＃ if theres enough money you have people drive their POVs [personally owned vehicles] or you can have them drive rentals. 
Foval says its easy to keep the voter fraud operation a secret. So you use shells. Use shell companies. 
Democrats are untouchable, he said. The question is, whether when you get caught by a reporter, does that matter? Because does it turn into an investigation or not? In this case, this state, the answer is no, because they dont have any power to do anything. 
Foval explained in the first video how pro-Clinton super PACs communicate with each other and how their information finds its way to the DNC, presumably a violation of federal law. 
I guaran-damn-tee you that the people who run the super PACs all talk to each other and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication. 
Were consultants, Foval says, so were not the official entity and so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts. 
He adds: 
The thing that we have to watch is making sure there is a double blind between the actual campaign and the actual DNC and what were doing. Theres a double blind there. So they can plausibly deny that they knew anything about it. 
The Clinton campaign is fully in it, veteran left-wing strategist Robert Creamer confirms on hidden camera. Hillary knows through the chain of command whats going on. 
OKeefes group, Project Veritas Action Fund, filed a formal complaint against the Clinton campaign with the Federal Election Commission last week. 
The complaint states that Project Veritas: 
uncovered a criminal conspiracy where, in the words of Scott Foval, ＆The way it works is: The [Hillary for America] campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays The Foval Group, The Foval Group goes and executes ＃ on the ground. This has been done in a manner to evade federal election law and violating coordinated expenditures rules. 
The complaint also accuses Priorities USA Action, Alliance for Retired Americans, Americans United for Change, and the Democratic National Committee of accepting prohibited and excessive contributions in the form of coordinated expenditures contrary to federal law and regulations. 
The first undercover video OKeefe released sent shock waves through the political community. 
In that video , released Oct. 17, we learned that the frequent outbursts of violence at Republican candidate Trumps campaign rallies have been orchestrated and paid for by Clintons campaign. 
The idea was to foment violent at Trump rallies in order to create the false impression that his campaign and supporters were violent crazy people and at the same time provide evidence to support the Lefts predetermined narrative that the billionaire businessman is a dangerous fascist. 
Such behavior constitutes terrorism, Austin Bay writes at the Observer : 
Creamer ran what amounts to a domestic U.S. political terror and propaganda operation dedicated to undermining the 2016 U.S. presidential election〞rigging the election, to use the current term. [＃] 
The election rigging scheme he commanded relies on street thuggery. That means physical fear〞terror〞is a core component of Americans United for Changes crooked enterprise. Street thuggery is very low-level terrorism, but it is a type of terrorism nonetheless and it is wrong to call it otherwise. Hardboy muscle, bottles and two by fours are street thuggerys kinetics. Bottles and baseball bats are not Al Qaedas high explosives〞but they incite fear and when they crack heads they cause casualties. People bleed. Street thuggery as an arm of politics is violent, criminalized politics on an ugly downward slope to much worse, the worse including lynchings and pogroms. If you dont think street thuggery is terror then consider Kristalnacht. 
And OKeefe isnt finished with the Hillary Clinton campaign yet. 
Our lawyers won't let us release all our @HillaryClinton & DNC footage[,]O'Keefe tweeted Tuesday.

Bruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. 
FBI Director James Comeys reopening of the investigation into Clintons emails has roiled once more the presidential election. Donald Trump has called the decision courageous and bigger than Watergate. Clinton, the DOJ, Democrat Senators, and their media flying monkeys are all having conniption fits over their quondam champions defection, calling the announcement appalling, absurd, strange, deeply troubling, an attack, and unprecedented. The bigger question is whether it will move enough voters over to Trumps side and put him in the White House. 
Theres no doubt that Comeys announcement eleven days before the election is mystifying. Not because it is unprecedented as the Democrats keep squealing. They had no such qualms when the weekend before the 1992 election, special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh indicted a poll-surging George H.W. Bush for his alleged involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal. No, the mystery is Comeys motives. Is Comey like Conrads Lord Jim, now sacrificing his FBI careersure to be over if the notoriously vengeful Clinton is elected to atone for having besmirched his office, reputation, and the principle of equality before the law in service to careerist self-interest? Or was he facing a mutiny and leaks from disgruntled FBI investigators? To quote one of our candidates, At this point, what difference does it make? 
The real question is whether it will make a difference to the voters. Right now we dont know if the content of the 650,000 emails from the conjugal laptop used by serial sexter Anthony Weiner, estranged husband of Clinton vizier Huma Abedin, will reveal something damning like, say, classified materials. But we already know that Clinton passed classified information over an unsecured server, which didnt bother Comey back in July. So what could be in these new emails that rises above Comeys sophistic extreme carelessness, and reaches the statutes gross negligence? Or has Comey found new evidence of Hillarys intent, his other exculpatory sophistry that had little to do with the law? There had to be something that made Comey subject himself to the scorched-earth wrath of the Democrats. 
Whatever is found on the Abedin laptop, one wonders if will even matter to a sufficient number of voters. They have shrugged off so many scandals, lies, and failures that should have sunk a candidacy, that its hard to calculate what level of incompetence, unpleasantness, dishonesty, sleaze, and crime is disqualifying anymore. Here are the greatest hits from Hillarys catalogue: Whitewater Missing billing records from her tenure at the Rose Law Firm Renting out the Lincoln Bedroom to donors Travelgate Illegal possession of FBI files Conducting illegal secret meetings of the Task Force on National Health Care Reform Cackling over keeping a pedophile rapist out of jail Hounding the victims of her husbands sexual assaults and philandering Stealing $200,000 worth of china, furniture, and artwork from the White House Claiming she landed under sniper fire in Bosnia Claiming she and Bill left the White House dead broke Shaking down Wall Street while assuring the Orcs of capitalism that shes got their back Charging exorbitant speaking fees for a half hour of banalities and bromides Calling 30,000 missing emails personal communications Lying about the Benghazi attack to the faces of the four dead Americans families Supporting the lie that the attacks were caused by an obscure Internet video when she knew the same night that they werent Perjuring herself before Congress and the FBI about the emails and her private server The disastrous overthrow of Ghaddafi in Libya The disastrous reset with Russia The disastrous nuclear deal with Iran The disastrous withdrawal from Iraq The corrupt Clinton Foundation and its wholly owned subsidiary, the pay-to-play State Department Using feminist rhetoric while taking cash from some of the planets most brutally misogynistic regimes Serially flip-flopping on issues like same-sex marriage, the Trans Pacific Trade deal, and the Keystone pipeline Promising to raise taxes on the middle class and put coal miners out of work Her campaign staffs dirty tricks against Trump and his supporters Her campaign staffs incestuous relationship with the media Her staffs illegal destruction of incriminating evidence during the email investigation Her strong support of gruesome late-term abortions And, last but not least, the continuing unanswered questions about her physical and cognitive health 
Back in the day, just a few of these gaffes, deceptions, and failures would probably have sunk a campaign for Congress, let alone the White House. 
And Mr. Trumps offenses? Hes talks exactly as youd expect a New York real estate developer, casino owner, reality television star, and beauty pageant mogul to talk Hes condemned as a sexual assaulter for saying a decade ago what Bill Clinton and every White-House-visiting rapper, movie star, or rock star knows about the sexual perks of celebrity: When youre a star they let you do it, as Trump bragged of his crude sexual advances Hes ignorant of policy He doesnt understand the economics of global trade He doesnt know what the nuclear triad is Hes addicted to a half dozen superlative adjectives He wants to build a wall with Mexico He takes legal advantage of tax law Hes not suitable for office He does not have the right temperament Hes used bankruptcy as a business tool Hes accused of groping over a dozen women, including a polymorphously perverse porn star Hes mean and insulting He has orange hair 
In short, Trump lacks the superficial patina of rhetorical decorum and sober demeanor that most modern presidents and candidates spray over their public personas in order to hide their private flaws and vices. Just ask Hillarys various Secret Service details how wide the distance between public and private personalities can be. 
The voters will decide for themselves which candidates catalogue of sins is more disqualifying and dangerous. But whatever happens, its clear that we the people have lowered the bar of acceptability for presidential candidates. 
This transformation happened decades before Trump and Hillary came along. After Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury related to his sordid sexual depredations in the White House, his approval ratings were 73%. He left the White House with a 66% rating, higher than any president since Harry Truman, including Ronald Reagan. Think about it: the president who sexually exploited an intern and was impeached for perjury left office with higher approval ratings than the president who rescued the economy and tossed the Soviet Union into its own dustbin of history. 
That was the inflection point for our political culture. No wonder that Barack Obamas lack of any real-world experience or achievement, left-wing views, self-confessed drug use, friends like the anti-American racist Jeremiah Wright and unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers, and gaping holes in his biography were unimportant to 45 million voters. So why now are we shocked, shocked that off-brand candidates like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are vying for the presidency? Decrying these candidates is closing the barn door after the horses of virtue, wisdom, and decorum have already long gone. 
So absent a smoking howitzer in the next WikiLeaks dump, Comeys restart of the investigation, which in any case will take months to complete, will probably not be the game-changing October surprise many hope for and others dread, especially given a corrupt medias studied indifference to anything that damages their candidate. Then again, the rapid erosion of Hillarys support is drawing analogies to Reagans late surge against Carter. 
Either way, on November 8, most people will vote their economic interests and their ideological passions, and decide based on subjective perceptions and silly criteria like cares for people like me. Or they might just finally realize that Hillarys accumulated offenses are intolerable. But what that standard of selection will deliver is anybodys guess.",english,2016-11-02T06:45:42.060+02:00,frontpagemag.com,US,34811,Will James Comey Change the Outcome of the Election?,0,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/james-comey.jpg?itok=qsfc7Mie,0,1,0,0,0,hate,Neutral

Posted on October 21, 2016 by Baxter Dmitry WikiLeaks couldnt have made it clearer in a series of tweets on Thursday  the US election for the President of the United States is rigged. The establishment have selected their President and by hook or crook she will be elected. 
Responding to allegations that WikiLeaks recent leaks have outed it as playing partisan politics, WikiLeaks fired back ,  You are not a fan of publishing true information about corrupt ruling power factions who will take power on Jan 20?  
On the day WikiLeaks publicized the release of emails from Barack Obamas personal account, their Twitter account then stated that the outcome of the election was planned from the outset:  What election? It has been clear from the beginning who is going to win. This is, in effect, a power consolidation exercise . 
Considering what we now know about the behind-the-scenes rigging of the Democratic primary, the collusion between the DNC establishment and mainstream media, and the fact Hillary Clinton pushed for Donald Trumps GOP nomination, can you possibly disagree? 
Are Presidents elected or selected? 
WikiLeaks emails from Barack Obamas personal email account reveal that the Bush administration contacted the future president multiple times before the election, secretly organizing the transition of power. 
The 2008 transition had gone down in history as surprisingly smooth. Martha Joynt Kumar, in a book about the transition, said it  was the best in anyones memory, in part because 9/11 made everyone recognize that a transition is fragile time . 
Todays revelations raise questions about why it was so smooth 〞 suggestions Obama was selected by the shadow government, rather than elected by the people, are no longer tinfoil hat territory. 
The most eye catching email in todays leak contains a message from John Podesta about an invitation from President George W. Bush to the President-Elect. 
Should that have read President-Select? Podesta sent the email to Obama before the election result was known. 
But it gets even worse. 
The emails show a transition plan was being worked on long before the 2008 election had taken place. According to an attached memo in one of the emails, Obama was already discussing his transition to office with members of the Bush Administration, including then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, prior to the election. 
 As you have observed in your interactions with Secretary Paulson, he is apparently eager to involve you and your transition team extensively in his policy choices following the election.  Are Presidents elected or selected? 
Another attached memo acknowledges that it was unusual to start the transition process so soon. 
 We are now at the point of deciding how to staff economic policy during the transition, who should be the point of contact with Treasury and how to blend the transition and campaign economic policy talent. 
Normally these decisions could be made after the election, and ideally after the selection of a National Economic Advisor, but, of course, these are not normal times.  
Not normal times? Perhaps not in 2008. But eight years later, it seems nothing has changed. What was not normal in 2008 has become very much the norm in 2016. 
Thanks to WikiLeaks and the unprecedented peek behind the curtains of power they have granted us, the shadow government has been exposed to the light. 2008 wasnt a smooth transition of power, it was silky smooth power consolidation. 
WikiLeaks variety of journalism  cold, hard, pristine truth  has more than ruffled feathers. The entire henhouse has gone mad. The ruling party are slavering at the mouth, and mainstream media has never been so easy to see through.

We have been very, very suspicious of Donald Trump since he began his political run. 
Many believed he was an outsider who was our only hope to tame the US federal government beast. But it has become very clear he is not. 
First, Wikileaks showed that Killary herself actually approved Trump to be her competitor. According to an email sent from an assistant at the Clinton campaign, Hillary was aware that Trump was going to run before the political process was fully underway. 
Clinton advised the mainstream media to push his legitimacy as a pied piper candidate because she realized, after looking at the poll numbers, that she wouldnt stand a chance at winning the presidency against any of the establishment republicans without making them pied pipers  it just so happened that Donald was the easiest to play the role considering his long history of friendship with the Clintons. 
In addition, the mainstream media was more than complicit in creating a narrative that the 2016 presidential elections were about Hillary Clinton vs Donald Trump from the get go. 
But, barely reported in the media, was that after the 3rd presidential debate, Clinton and Trump went out for a night on the town together＃ and where they went is of great interest. 
They went to an annual Jesuit function which is usually full of New World Order types. 
THE JESUITS 
One of the more interesting things that occurred right at the end of the Jubilee year in early October, was that the Jesuits installed a new Superior General, with the date to commence being actually at midnight on the end of Jubilee. 
We found this interesting because there is plenty of evidence that the Jesuits are at least one major arm of what you can call the illuminati. 
In fact, the Jesuits were founded in Spain by what various reports call crypto Jews  those who are Jewish but pretending to be Catholic. Certainly at that time in Spain it was safer not to be a Jew. 
Even Wikipedia, which wouldnt recognize a conspiracy if it were directly presented by its participants has this to say about the Jesuits: 
＃ In the first 30 years of the existence of the Society of Jesus there were many Jesuit conversos (Catholic-convert Jews) including the second Father General Diego Lainez ＃ The original founder Ignatius ＃ said that he, would take it as a special grace from our Lord to come from Jewish lineage. 
At the beginning of the Al Smith dinner party after Cardinal Dolan was introduced, a joke was even made by a speaker that everyone in attendance is doing their part in supporting their charitable efforts and that it couldnt be done without the support of many of the other devoted Catholics on stage like Henry Kissinger, Howard Rubenstein, and Mort Zuckerman  all of whom are obviously Jewish so this remark was naturally met with a lot of laughter＃ 
In fact, an extraordinary amount of controversy swirls around Jesuits. They are said to constitute the Black Church and thus adhere to the same Satanic religion as the worlds elite bankers supposedly hold. 
The leader of the Jesuit order is commonly recognized in conspiratorial circles as the Black Pope whose signature staff is a crooked cross. Historically, the Jesuit Order has been seen as one that shirks no crime in expanding the power of the Church. 
Lest this sound entirely outrageous, one must note that the Jesuits are, for instance, the inventors of concentration camps, which they established in Paraguay in order to incarcerate and then torture the native indians of the area. 
But the litany of attributed Jesuit evil is even darker than that according to those who believe in the orders continued malicious pursuit. The supposed founder of the Bavarian-based Illuminati, Adam Weishaupt, was a Jesuit. 
In fact, the order is reputed to have been deeply involved in the Illuminatis initial expansion, and chances are it is still deeply involved. 
One more thing that highlights the evil of the Jesuits is their extreme oath of induction which all superiors must take in order to be elevated to the higher rungs of the organization. This is taken from the book Subterranean Rome by Carlos Didier, translated from the French, and published in New York in 1843 and reads in part, 
＃promise and declare that I will, when opportunity present, make and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, as I am directed to do, to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex or condition; and that I will hang, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever their execrable race. That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poniard or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus＃ 
One of the most poignant quotes regarding the malevolence of the Jesuits comes from Marquis de LaFayette 1757-1834; who was a French statesman and general who served in the American Continental Army under the command of General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War. 
His quote is as follows: 
It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country  the United States of America  are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe. 
THE BIG BASH 
When evaluating Jesuit behavior and influence, please keep in mind that both Donald Trump and Hillarys VP, Tim Kaine, are Jesuit educated. And it should be of GREAT interest, therefore, that practically on the eve of the US election, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton partied the night away at a Jesuit function that included such prominent Jesuit-trained attendees as Henry Kissinger. 
Not only did the two not look like sworn enemies＃ they looked like two star crossed lovers going to their first prom. 
We have long held to our stance that Killary will be the next President of the US. The amount of vote rigging, murders and shenanigans to even get her to where she is so far has been tremendous＃ and it wont stop. 
That said, if by some fluke, and the Diebold machines malfunction or people in the US wake up slightly and Donald Trump gets elected＃ it is pretty clear they are on the same team and, as weve said previously, nothing major will change. 
So, if you were hoping that this election could change things in the US＃ get over that hope right now. It might change things, but only for the much, much worse. 
This charade is being played right in front of everyones eyes and most do not understand what is happening or why jokes like the Catholic joke is actually funny to these elite people. 
They are laughing at the peasants stupidity and lack of understanding, not because the men mentioned are Jews＃ anyone with half a brain knows that. 
But while they laugh, well be laughing all the way to the bank ourselves. Just because these sick people are formulating diabolical plans to enslave humanity doesnt mean we cant profit from their planned chaos. Its better than sitting back in ignorance and making nothing. 
Our analysis of these elites occult timelines which began with the Shemitah and culminated with the Jubilee, have helped us to accumulate around a 200% collective return on our portfolio in the last year.

The Mind Unleashed 
On November 8th, 2016, hundreds and possibly thousands flash-mob meditations will commence at the polling stations everywhere across America. Elevate The Vote says that this is a non-partisan participatory event that is open to everyone. Its about the fundamental unity of human life that seems to have been so forgotten in this campaign. 
The intention is to  elevate the consciousness of every U.S. voter on election day, impacting how we feel about ourselves, politics, this election, and each other. Meditation gives you an opportunity to come to know your invisible self. It allows you to empty yourself of the endless hyperactivity of your mind, and to attain calmness. It teaches you to be peaceful, to remove stress, to receive answers where confusion previously reigned.  Dr. Wayne Dyer Image Source 
While many will love this concept, some may be a bit skeptical of it having any effect. With that, we can look further at the studies that have been done on synchronized meditations and the measurable effects they did create. 
What is known as the Maharishi Effect has actually been studied over 600 times, which was conducted in 33 countries and in over 250 independent research institutions. The evidence overwhelmingly correlates synchronized group prayer and meditation having extremely positive social, political and economic benefits to the world. Positive correlations for numerous health benefits to the individual were also observed and confirmed. 
The most well-known study on this effect was done in 1974, which observed three different gatherings of over 7,000 people meditating each morning and evening for three consecutive weeks. The study took place in Fairfield, Iowa (December 17, 1983-January 6, 1984), The Hague, Holland (December 21, 1984-January 13, 1985) and Washington, DC (July 1-July 10, 1985). The results were astounding. According to the Rand Corporation, a think-tank based in California, acts of global terrorism resulting in fatalities and injuries were reduced by 72%. Time series analysis was used in this study to rule out possibilities that the reduction in global terrorism was caused by pre-existing trends, drifts in data or cycles. But how was this done then? How did it spread from a small group to a larger one? 
Scientists believe this is due to a coherent resonance being created in the Unified Quantum Field by those meditating. 
Going a bit further with it, we can think of a laser. Its coherent light is established by what is known in physics as the Field Effect. The Field Effects principle, according to the Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy is that it is not necessary to act individually on each individual constituent of a system, but that the system can be handled in one stroke at the collective level. 
The 7,000 people meditating created a Field Effect of harmonious coherence that spread throughout the collectivewhich in turn helped to reduce acts of terrorism (incoherent, disruptive energy). Synchronized meditation shifts events and timelines in our Quantum Universe. Souce 
If you live outside of the U.S. you can also join in by meditating with a global synchronized meditation that begins at 3pm Pacific Time (U.S.). Also, you can add to this movement even if you live in the U.S. by meditating at this time or at a local polling station. If you plan not to vote or already voted, you can also stay at home and meditate that evening. Let us all envision a world at peace, ourselves at peace and all social systems in balance and at peace.

[10/28/16] Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. 
Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News ＃ 
Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. 
The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. 
If anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election, then they arent paying much attention, Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. 
And without a doubt, voting locations are soft targets that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters ＃ 
There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didnt have 15 or 20 years ago, said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee.  What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then thats certainly concerning. 
All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. 
Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. 
Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania ＃ Post navigation",english,2016-10-28T18:08:13.122+03:00,govtslaves.info,US,,SCHOOLS ALL OVER AMERICA ARE CLOSING ON ELECTION DAY DUE TO FEARS OF VIOLENCE,0,http://www.govtslaves.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/school-bus.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, the founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. 
The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democrat and Republican Primaries. 
Data such as engagement with tweets or Facebook Live videos have been taken into account. The result is that Trump has overtaken the engagement numbers of Barack Obamas peak in 2008  the year he came into power  by 25 percent. 
Rai said that his AI system shows that candidate in each election who had leading engagement data ended up winning the elections. 
If Trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years since Internet engagement began in full earnest, Rai wrote in a report sent to CNBC.

[10/28/16] MIKE ADAMS -To even call this 2016 president election an election is a cruel joke. Democracy is supposed to be about open, fair and free elections, and those elections must be predicated on open, fair and free access to information so that voters can make an informed decision. Yet all we have today is a media thats in the tank for Hillary, a justice system infiltrated by deep state corruption, a voting system rife with leftist fraud, a culture of extremist, violent intimidation of those who oppose Clinton and an Obama regime steeped in such criminality and fraud that it actively encourages illegal aliens to run across the border to America so they can vote. 
This isnt an election＃ its a coordinated leftist coup detat . 
The aim of the coup is to occupy all the positions of power in America with radical leftists, communists and criminal democrat party loyalists. From those positions of power, the strategy is to systematically dismantle the American Constitution, Bill of Rights and Supreme Court while crushing the American middle class with punitive economic policies that keep the masses trapped in poverty (Obamacare, anyone?). 
Its now abundantly obvious to nearly every thinking person that democracy has been ripped to shreds in America , and the deep state criminal regime in power exists solely to protect and enrich itself at the expense of everyone else. 
GONE is the idea of representing the interests of the People. 
GONE is any desire for government to operate with transparency and accountability. 
GONE is any trust in voters by the powerful elite, who distrust the voters so much that they make sure every election is rigged in advance. 
GONE is any economic policy rooted in sanity or mathematics. Now, numbers and dollars from Washington are all rooted in mental illness and delusion. 
GONE is any semblance of the concept that justice is blind and that all laws apply to all the people just the same, no matter how powerful they may be. 
GONE is any public trust in ANY institution of government, from Congress, to the federal courts, to the regulators like the EPA, to even the FBI. 
GONE is any notion that the government should defend the nations borders and control the flow of immigrants into the country for all the obvious reasons. 
And GONE is any concept of journalistic integrity across the mainstream media, an institution that now holds actual journalism in contempt (i.e. the work of Wikileaks or Project Veritas). Now, the media insists that no one question the government, no transparency is necessary, and government operatives have no obligation to explain any of their actions or cover-ups. Richard Nixon is rolling in his grave＃ The illusion of democracy 
Thanks to the complete abandonment of democracy and honest government in America, We the People now wake up each day as slaves living in a totalitarian dictatorship pretending to be a democracy , complete with a pretend press, a pretend judicial system, a pretend legislative branch and even a pretend central bank pumping out pretend currency. 
We turn on our televisions to watch pretend journalists named Stephanopoulos churn out pretend news that pretends Bill and Hillary Clinton are honest, affectionate, trustworthy elders instead of the phony frauds and crooks theyve really turned out to be. And then were blasted with pretend polls that claim the most unpopular woman in America 〞 Hillary Clinton 〞 is somehow ahead of Donald Trump by 12 points. Nobody believes the polls anymore＃ 
Every time REAL news breaks through the surface, the establishment tells us thats all fake. Wikileaks emails, were ridiculously told, arent real (even though they are). Project Veritas videos have been edited, were told, as if that somehow negates the very clear words caught on video as they are uttered by Clinton operatives committing serious crimes. The only news thats real, were told, is the fabricated fake news planted in the New York Times by the Clinton campaign. A call to arrest and imprison the presstitutes that are defrauding America and destroying democracy 
In truth, the leftist media is staffed by presstitutes 〞 media whores who have sold out to the Clintons in exchange for access to her bogus news releases (i.e. planted false narratives). As reported by The Free Thought Project , all the following journalists are seditious whores who should no doubt be arrested, indicted and prosecuted for engaging in criminal collusion and racketeering with the Clintons:

[10/28/16] On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. 
The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. 
The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clintons Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is rigged. 
Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). 
I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake, said Sen. Clinton.

As a reminder, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange currently finds himself in the Ecuador embassy where his internet access has been revoked for the duration of the presidential campaign to avoid the appearance of intervention. 
Wikileaks supporters, now including a number of disgruntled GOP nominee Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders supporters, promptly replied with tweets expressing hope that phase three would ultimately damage Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons campaign. User CorruptMedia responded with a Photoshopped estimating what CNN coverage of Clinton being escorted to jail would look like.

[10/31/16] MICHAEL SNYDER -Just when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a game changer into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clintons mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails did not come from her private server, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry, and according to some reports there may be potentially thousands of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? 
Lets take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ 
After recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that appear to be pertinent to the email probe. 
In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation, Comey wrote the chairmen. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. 
At this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clintons closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clintons Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ 
We dont know what this means yet except that its a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So thats where we are＃ 
Is it a certainty that we wont learn before the election? Im not sure its a certainty we wont learn before the election. 
One thing is, its possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ 
If the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? 
It is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. 
So those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. 
But if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ 
If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 
DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. 
But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. 
It would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. 
In such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be fair until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. 
Meanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. 
And CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ 
An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. 
MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. 
The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. 
Without Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. 
So if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. 
At this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.

[10/31/16] INFOWARS  Bev Harris, the countrys leading vote fraud expert, joined the Alex Jones Show Monday to reveal the results of a bombshell investigation into vote shaving software. 
Used in precincts all across the country, the software  deemed the most devastating election theft mechanism yet found  allows votes to be fractured and rounded up or down to sway the results for any candidate. 
According to Harris, a member of the non-partisan Black Box Voting investigative team, this latest discovery constitutes the missing piece that blows the lid off of wide-scale voter fraud. 
It was put in the system in 2001 but it came into wide use in 2006, Harris said. It took someone with a special set of skills to know what to look for. 
A mini-documentary by Black Box Voting on the discovery shows real-time demonstrations with the secretive software. 
It can give contract signing authority to whoever the user chooses, the videos description states. All political power can be converted to the hands of a few anonymous subcontractors. 
It runs silently, invisibly, and can produce plausible results that really pass for the real thing. 
Further analysis on the malicious software provided by Alex Jones reveals how this revelation ties into the 2016 presidential election.

Its hard to explain. J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye Eleanor Rigby＃Lives in a dream/Waits at the window, wearing a face/That she keeps in a jar by the door/Who is it for? The Beatles, Eleanor Rigby Editor's Note The analogy of the mask and the role it plays in our lives provides fertile ground for discussion of this (endless) political season. That each of us plays some role in this farce (in the classic sense of that word) is an important recognition. More than any election in my lifetime I have heard you cant make this shit up. A classic statement of life imitating art imitating fantastical life. Unfortunately, for many of us, myself included, this feels more like a nightmare from which I cannot wake myself. There is a world in the balance. One could say that there always in when dealing with a deck stacked with the arsenal of the United States. However, now we are dealing with an unfolding environmental catastrophe which will leave more dead than we can count. The new estimate from the World Wildlife Fund is that two-thirds of the worlds wildlife will be extinct by 2020. That is less than 4 years. Those species deaths will certainly be accompanied by the decimation of countless human lives as well. So pick your stage and which play is real. T he idiocy of the Presidential election race will soon be over, as will the endless pseudo-debates and the droning of the commentators, who have been prattling on for more than a year, as if there were something to consider about this sick farce; as if the deep state had not been directing this life-movie from the start.
Gore Vidal got a laugh when years ago he referred to Ronald Reagan as our acting president. But weve had four acting presidents since and their acts have left millions dead and wounded around the globe, including thousands of American troops. Now we have the sordid spectacle of an election campaign that is so patently phony that delusionary is the only word that can describe the thinking of those who take it seriously. Many Americans have acquiesced in this ongoing tragedy, playing their parts in this deadly charade. The ghosts of all Americas victims walk among us, and they will haunt us until we come to life by admitting our own complicity in their deaths. The show must not go on, but it will, as long as we keep acting our parts. 
Norman O. Brown so well describes our stage set: Ancestral voices prophesying war; ancestral spirits in the danse macabre or war dance; Valhalla, ghostly warriors who kill each other and are reborn to fight again. All warfare is ghostly, every army an exercitus feralis (army of ghosts), every soldier a living corpse. 
The Obama administration repeatedly sets the stage by talking about and waging an endless war, a thirty year war, a long struggle, an open-ended war. Soon Obamas feral, war loving understudy, Hillary Clinton, will take center stage as he exits right, after promoting her. This is not me going through the motions here, he recently said. I really, really, really want to elect Hillary Clinton. The role-playing, black face of empire will be replaced by the role-playing female face of empire as the audience cheers, hiding from their masked selves their part in a face-saving, phony performance. Without a complicit audience, the performance cant go on. But it does, or, as Kurt Vonnegut put it, so it goes. But the act is wearing thin. 
The autumnal season and especially the Halloween weekend of ghosts, the dead, and masks has me thinking of my own experience with acting, and how understanding the nature of our complicity in a mass act of bad faith is so important. 
Having grown up as the only brother among seven sisters, I was always my parents favorite son. With such dumb luck, I never felt the need to be someone I wasnt and so accepted my favored fate. But from an early age I learned from my sisters what it meant to put on your face. Like most girls in a cosmetic culture, they would stand or sit in front of a mirror dutifully applying lipstick, cover-up, and mascara (Italian, maschera , mask) in preparation for their entrances onto the social stage where they would face so many other faces facing and eyeing them. Mirrors meeting mirrors, looking-glass selves. It seemed to the boy I was, such an exhausting act. 
At the time I had only a dim awareness of life the movie. 
Then, when I was a young teenager, I had the great opportunity to learn how to be a public phony and put on a face. I got to lie to a national television audience and got paid for my deception. The show was a very popular one  To Tell the Truth  one of many game shows my parents, sisters, and I appeared on. We were a theatrical family, not trained actors, but a brood of faces unconsciously hoping to discover who they were through their acts. My parents had started this by accepting an invitation to appear on a show hosted by Johnny Carson, Do You Trust Your Wife? (The show was later renamed Who Do You Trust?  an apt, albeit grammatically incorrect, appellation for the paranoid Cold War years.) But I didnt then care about politics; I just wanted to put on a good face and lie well while ostensibly telling the truth. I succeeded by convincing two of the celebrity panelists that I was who I wasnt  Robert McGee  and getting paid $250 for my act. Lying seemed so easy; all you needed was a good mask and a convincing demeanor. This was my public lesson in putting on your face. 
Ever since then, Ive been fascinated by masks, liars, and the role of acting on the social stage. Ghosts of the Past by Ian Kath. 
As the Halloween weekend transpires, this enchantment increases. I think of how all persons are, by definition, masked, the word ＆person being derived from the Latin, persona, meaning mask. Another Latin word, larva, occurs to me, it too meaning mask, ghost, or evil spirit. The living masks light up for me as I think of ghosts, the dead, all the souls and spirits circulating through our days. While etymology might seem arcane, I rather think it offers us a portal into our lives, not just personally, but politically and culturally as well. Shakespeare was right, of course, all the worlds a stage, though I would disagree with the bard that we are merely players. It does often seem that way, but seeming is the essence of the actors show and tell. But who are we behind the masks? Who is it uttering those words coming through the masks mouth holes (the per-sona , Latin, to sound through). 
Halloween. The children play at scaring and being scared. Death walks among them and they scream with glee. The play is on. The grim reaper walks up and down the street. Treats greet them. The costumes are ingenious; the masks, wild. The parents stand behind, watching, smiling. Its all great fun, the candy sweet. So whats the trick? When does the performance end? 
As Halloween ends, the saints come marching in followed by all the souls. The Days of the Dead. Spirits. Ghosts walk the streets. Dead leaves fall. The dead are everywhere, swirling through the air, drifting. We are surrounded by them. We are them. Until. 
Until when? Perhaps not until we dead awaken and see through the charade of social life and realize the masked performers are not just the deadly politicians and celebrities, not only the professional actors and the corporate media performers, but us. 
Lying is the leading cause of living death in the United States, and the pharmaceutical companies have no prescription for this one. Not yet, anyway, as far as I care to know. 
It seems to me that Albert Camus was right, and that we should aspire to be neither victims nor executioners. To do so will take a serious reevaluation of the roles we play in the ongoing national tragedy of lie piled upon lie in aggressive wars around the world and in election farces that perpetuate them. The leading actors we elect are our responsibility. We produce and maintain them. They are our mirror images; we, theirs. It is the danse macabre , a last tango in the land of bad actors, our two-faced show. This masquerade ball that passes for political reality is infiltrated by the ghosts of all those victims we have murdered around the wide world. We may choose not to see them, but they are lurking in the shadowy corners. And they will haunt us until we make amends. 
Do you not know there comes a midnight hour when everyone has to throw off his mask? warned Kierkegaard, Do you believe that life will always let itself be mocked? Do you think you can slip away a little before midnight in order to avoid this? Or are you not terrified by it? 
Whenever I take up a newspaper, Ibsen added, I seem to see ghosts gliding between the lines. There must be ghosts all the country over, as thick as the sands of the sea. And then we are, one and all, so pitifully afraid of the light.

1. THE COMEY IMBROGLIO 
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D. NV) accused him of tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo, saying his action appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another  claiming he may have broken the law, citing the 1939 Hatch Act (An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities). It prohibits federal executive branch employees from engaging in certain forms of political activity  exempting the president, vice president and designated high-level administration officials. Proof of intent is required to hold someone culpable under the law. .. According to the Wall Street Journal , within the FBI, there was  sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign. .. In a prominently featured NYT op-ed , Law Professor Richard Painter said (w)e cannot allow FBI or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power. .. Not according to former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman, saying Comeys critics cannot show his letter violated the Hatch Act unless they can prove that the FBI director was intending to influence the election rather than inform Congress, which was (his) stated aim. .. A Sunday released ABC News/Washington Post poll indicated about a third of likely voters are less likely to support Hillary following Comeys October surprise. .. The Washington Post said the Justice Departments public integrity unit blocked the FBI from investigating the Clinton Foundation, claiming inadequate evidence to move forward. The department is run by longtime Bill and Hillary ally, Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Last June, she met privately with the former president at Phoenixs Sky Harbor airport while Hillary was under FBI investigation  a clear conflict of interest despite her disingenuously claiming no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body took place. .. In a Washington Post op-ed , former attorney general Eric Holder expressed concern about Comeys vague letter to Congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of public, and political, interest  claiming he violated long-standing Justice Department policies and tradition. .. Holder disgraced the office he held. Law Professor Francis Boyle called him a total disaster for the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, Human Rights and the Rule of Law. Speaking in Florida on Sunday, Hillary changed the subject, saying  theres a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want, and what kind of president can help us get there. We wont be distracted no matter what our opponents throw at us. .. Clearly, Comeys bombshell changed the dynamic of the race, whether enough to derail her White House bid well know in days. Reports indicate the FBI will examine an astonishing 650,000 emails from former Congressman Anthony Weiners laptop  estranged husband of top Hillary aide Huma Abedin. .. 
It could take months to review volume this immense, likely extending well beyond November 8 and Januarys inauguration, to determine if any evidence warrants prosecuting Hillary, Abedin, Weiner or anyone else for mishandling classified government documents, perhaps compromising national security. 
2. INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS & SELF-INFLICTED POLITICAL IDIOCY 
Harvard Undergrads for Hillary 
OVERWHELMING SYSTEMIC PROPAGANDA ALLIED WITH A PERVASIVE INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS CONSPIRE TO KEEP MINDS THAT SHOULD KNOW BETTER FROM SEEING THE MOST ELEMENTARY TRUTHS. BEING OFFICIALLY SMART IS NO VACCINE AGAINST THE BRAINWASH. A ccording to the student newspaper Harvard Crimsons October survey , 87% of undergrads support Hillary. A scant 6% back Trump, 5.8% for Libertarian Gary (whats Aleppo) Johnson, and less than 1% for Harvard College and Medical School graduate Jill Stein  the only peoples candidate running. .. Around one-third of undergrads responded (2,128 out of a total 6,645 student body)  so the views of nonrespondents arent known. About 91% are eligible to vote in November. Eligibility begins at age 18. A surprising 96% of respondents intend voting, they said. .. The national average is far lower. Whether this years contentious election encourages a larger than usual turnout remains to be seen. The Crimson poll was conducted from October 10  20  before FBI Director Comeys October surprise. Whether it would have changed the results is unknown. Two-thirds of respondents said they support Democrat party candidates, 12% calling themselves Republicans, 19% saying theyre independents. .. Trump and Hillary are the most widely reviled presidential aspirants in US history. Yet 70% of Crimson respondents view her favorably  showing little knowledge of her deplorable public record since the 1990s unless they support her war crimes, racketeering and perjury. What to make of it? Undergrads enter Harvard (and other colleges) as teenagers, young and naive as I was when entering the college long ago. .. After graduation, I discovered the meaning of the term commencement. Institutions like Harvard teach students to be good citizens, omitting the ugly stuff about US imperialism, officials advancing it, waging endless wars of aggression. .. The so-called Korean War was ongoing when I was there, an incentive to maintain good grades, stay in school, avoid being drafted and sent to North Koreas frozen Chosin, an expression used by members of my class. .. The Paper Chase Hollywood film (1973) featured John Houseman as stern Harvard Law School Professor Charles Kingsfield. His most memorable line on day one for first year students was saying (y)ou teach yourselves the law, but I train your minds. You come here with a skull full of mush. You leave thinking like a lawyer. .. I began my freshman year with a skull full of mush, gradually extracting it. College and graduate school taught me to think. Learning and comprehension mostly came later. The older I get, the greater my understanding of world and national issues. .. Im long removed from campus life. Back then, students had none of the advantages available today  no computers, no Internet. Daily writing I dearly love now was a dreaded chore back then  requiring research by rolodex cards and library stacks, a time-consuming process. Except for the type primary research I did for my masters thesis, most everything needed today for compositions or articles like mine is available on our desktops. .. Its understandable why young minds havent achieved the wisdom of the ages. Still its disturbing to find Harvard undergrads uninformed and out-of-touch on Hillarys deplorable public record  when its so easy to research it and know what she and husband Bill are all about. .. Why hasnt the Harvard student body done its homework for perhaps the most important election in our lifetime. The stakes are huge  possible war on Russia with Hillary empowered or improved bilateral relations under Trump. Nothing matters more than saving humanity from the scourge of catastrophic thermonuclear war able to kill us all.

The letter sent Friday to Congress by FBI Director James Comey, informing it of a new avenue of investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private email server, has lifted the lid on a raging conflict within the state apparatus. Long-simmering tensions are exploding into open political warfare. Since Friday, various officials within the FBI and the Justice Department have let it be known that the investigation into Clinton has generated sharp divisions, with local FBI offices demanding a more aggressive investigation into Clintons alleged mishandling of classified information as well as a separate probe into allegations of corruption involving the multi-billion-dollar Clinton Foundation. This internecine conflict intensified after Comey announced last July that the investigation into Clintons emails was completed and no criminal charges would be brought. With his letter to Congress, Comey intervened on the side of the faction calling for more aggressive action against Clinton. Justice Department officials have let it be known that they opposed Comeys decision to make public, just 11 days before the November 8 election, the agencys review of additional emails. The Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with former attorneys general, Republican as well as Democratic, have bitterly denounced Comeys action. Harry Reid, the top Senate Democrat, sent a letter accusing Comey of violating the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from publicly acting in support of one or another candidate. At least one Democratic congressman has demanded that the FBI chief immediately resign. Only a few weeks ago, Clinton and the Democratic Party were indignantly denouncing Trumps charges that the election was rigged. Such charges, they claimed, were an unpatriotic slur on the pristine character of US elections and American democracy. Now, under changed circumstances, it is they who are shouting foul and accusing the FBI of trying to rig the vote against them. In fact, both factions of the ruling class have utilized the methods of scandal-mongering to fight out their battles. Over the past several months, the Democrats have centered their campaign against Trump on sex scandals and neo-McCarthyite, manufactured claims that Trump is a proxy of the Kremlin. In his letter to Comey, Reid doubled down on these charges by accusing the FBI of refusing to make public explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government〞a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States＃ Trump, for his part, had pointed to the pro-Clinton bias of the media, denounced the failure of the FBI to prosecute Clinton, and made thinly veiled appeals to anti-immigrant and racist sentiment by charging that Election Day would see systematic ballot-stuffing in predominantly immigrant and minority communities. In fact, the entire election is a mockery of genuine democracy. Neither of the parties can offer any policies to address the real concerns of working people. Mud-slinging and scandal-mongering are used to bury the burning issues of war, social inequality and attacks on democratic rights. The latest turn in the presidential race underscores the reactionary basis on which Clinton and the Democrats have conducted their campaign. They have sought to oppose the fascistic Trump from the right, seeking to win the support of Republican leaders and voters as well as the military/intelligence establishment by promoting Clintons credentials as an advocate of military intervention, while declaring Trump unfit to serve as commander in chief. Their barely disguised indifference to the plight of workers and lack of support within the working class have made them highly vulnerable to the machinations of pro-Trump forces within the state. These developments have also underscored the treacherous role of Bernie Sanders. Having won mass support in the working class and among young people by portraying himself as a socialist and opponent of the billionaire class, he has sought to use his influence to channel social opposition back behind the Democratic Party and the campaign of Clinton, the favored candidate of Wall Street. He has thereby played a critical role in preempting and blocking the emergence of an independent political movement of the working class. Regardless which candidate wins the election next Tuesday, nothing will be resolved in the crisis of the two-party system. Both candidates, the two most unpopular in US history, are despised by broad masses of the population, and the election result will be seen as illegitimate by a majority of the American people. A Trump victory will be seen by tens of millions of workers as a declaration of war against the working class. A Clinton win will be seen as a continuation of the reactionary status quo. Nor will the ferocious conflicts within the state recede. These are rooted objectively in a historic crisis of American and world capitalism. Economic crisis and decay, ever-widening social polarization and intensifying geopolitical conflicts have fatally eroded the foundations of bourgeois democracy. The unprecedented political crisis that has erupted in the 2016 elections is the outcome of a protracted process. The breakdown of the political system emerged in open and explosive form in the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton on the basis of a sex scandal. In an editorial titled Is America drifting towards civil war? published by the World Socialist Web Site following the vote by the House of Representatives to impeach Clinton, we wrote: The crisis in Washington arises from an interaction of complex political, social and economic processes. Bourgeois democracy is breaking down beneath the weight of accumulated and increasingly insoluble contradictions. That watershed event was followed by the stolen election of 2000 and the launching one year later of the war on terror after the 9/11 attacks. Fifteen years of uninterrupted and ever expanding war, accompanied by a frontal attack on democratic rights and the erection of the framework of police state rule, the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, and a further transfer of wealth to the rich have only increased the power of the military and intelligence deep state and further eroded the traditional constitutional framework of capitalist rule in America. These processes have found a toxic expression in the degrading spectacle of the 2016 election. In an election dominated by the growth of social opposition and disgust with the entire political system, voters are left with the choice between two corrupt, right-wing representatives of the richest 1 percent. It is crucial that the working class intervene into the political crisis as an independent force fighting for a program that addresses its needs and interests, not the drive for profit of the financial aristocracy. Short of this, the crisis of the two-party system will produce only a further lurch to the right, with more brutal attacks on working class living standards and an accelerated movement toward dictatorship and a new world war.

At the same time, he launched into an extensive negative analysis of what had been done with emails, sensitive or not, on State Department or private servers, by Mrs. Clinton and members of her staff. That statement, very unusual for an FBI Director to make, had a transitory effect on Clintons poll numbers. But at the same time, the Director, in a highly unusual action, little noticed at the time, told leading Republican on the House Intelligence Committee that it would keep them informed of any further developments. As is well-known, just now there have been further developments. Mr. Comey announced publicly that there would be a further investigation of (possible) Clinton emails. He made this announcement before any investigation had begun, much less concluded and before his agents had obtained even so much as a warrant for seizing a lap-top belonging to the estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, of one of Mrs. Clintons closest aides, Huma Abedin. This action by Comey was considered to be highly unusual, to say the least, by a variety of sources/authorities, including, for example, The New York Times editorial page . It was even unclear as to whether, after some kind of preliminary evaluation, the previous formal inquiry would be reopened. The U.S. Justice Department strongly discouraged Comey from making such an speculative announcement (as in their might be a further investigation after weve had a look at Mr. Weiner server which 〞 who knows 〞 might simply be filled with photos of Mr. Weiners private parts taken from a wide variety of angles). It appeared as if Mr. Comey himself might be violating the law, that is the 1939 Hatch Act , which prohibits government employees from taking actions close to elections which might influence their outcomes. A Republican, Richard Painter, who worked as the Chief Ethics Officer in the Bush White House (and a Clinton supporter this time around), went so far as to file a formal ethics complaint against Comey, for apparent violation of the Hatch Act (which would be a criminal offense). There have been a variety of political outcomes from the Comey action, ranging from no change in the Clinton/Trump poll numbers to significant changes in them, from no change in the generally predicted Clinton lock on the Electoral College vote to possibly enough of a Trump swing in the swing states to give the election to him. Most observers are not attributing ulterior motives to Mr. Comey. He made a simple mistake. He was trying to be open about what is going on, but he was premature in making such an announcement 〞 poor judgement. He was under pressure from Congressional Republicans. Suppose that he had not announced the further investigation [of a bunch of emails that might not even be Clintons] in advance of its being undertaken, and then something had come of it after the election? Boy, would they be mad [or worse]. Well, folks, I dont buy any of it. I think that what Comey did, from the July even though we have nothing criminal on you youre a bad girl speech to the present we are announcing that an investigation will be starting [once we get a warrant], without any idea that anything further that might be incriminating might be found is all part of a plan. (And yes, this is a conspiracy hypothesis, but not quite the kind that Alex Jones would come up with.) In 2013 Mr. Comey was given the customary ten-year term appointment as FBI Director by President Barack Obama. (Wonder why in all of this bruhaha from the Democrats Obama gave him a vote of confidence?) A career Federal prosecutor and occasional corporate lawyer who eventually became Deputy Attorney General under Bush , he is a Republican. He has had a reputation for highly ethical behavior. He does not live in a bubble, however. He had to have known that what he was doing when he gave his totally unnecessary speech when he announced no criminal findings in the original Clinton emails/server case. While it did not seem to have any long-term political effects, it did stir the political pot at the time. This announcement has the pot boiling. It could swing the election to Trump. Although the conventional wisdom as of Nov. 1, when this column is being written, is that it wont, because of Clintons heavy advantage in the Electoral College, Glenn Beck, an arch-reactionary who happens to be anti-Trump, thinks that Comeys announcement is one of the most irresponsible things to ever happen and could swing the election to Trump. And although unlikely, it could. So how did this happen? Well, Comet Comey has a phone (you can sure that the doesnt do political stuff by email), and it is as secure a one as can be found. As I have pointed out previously, there is an increasingly large sector of the ruling class, led by some very wealthy hedge fund managers like the one who came to the Trump campaign along with Steve Bannon (from the Cruz campaign). They REALLY want Trump to win: further huge tax cuts for the wealthy and the end of regulation as we know it. My guess is that they got to Comey. What they offered or promised him, if anything at all, is impossible to know. But I do believe that that is what happened. Comey is a long-time Federal lawyer. He is now the Director of the FBI. He had to know about the Hatch Act, and that he would be violating it. He also knows that regardless of the outcome of the election he is never going to be prosecuted for doing so. Until last Friday, Trump was sinking and a number of down-ticket Republicans were going with him. Now, as the result of the announcement of something that might or might not happen, Trump is making huge hay of it and could win, and even more importantly the Republicans have a much better chance of holding on to the Senate. This did not happen by accident. An unprecedented announcement in October goes back to an unprecedented speech in July. Unprecedented once? Well, maybe by happenstance. Unprecedented twice? Well, not so much. Postscript: According to the FBI, there is no direct connection between Donald Trump and the Russian Government/business sector. According to a long-time counter-intelligence operative of another country, there are numerous documents showing just such relationships and he gave them to the FBI . Heres one excerpt:  Mother Jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote. The first memo, based on the former intelligence officers conversations with Russian sources, noted, ＆Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance. It maintained that Trump ＆and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals. It claimed that Russian intelligence had ＆compromised Trump during his visits to Moscow and could ＆blackmail him.  This is stuff for an actual investigation. Is there any evidence that one is underway? Well, it would be improper for the FBI to comment on investigations that are still in process (only on those that have not yet begun). But the media are not letting go on this one . Do stay tuned (and remember, I wrote this on November 1).

By a margin of 82 percent to 13 percent, better than six to one, those polled said the campaigns of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have filled them with revulsion. According to the Times account, With more than eight in ten voters saying the campaign has left them repulsed rather than excited, the rising toxicity threatens the ultimate victor. Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, and Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, are seen as dishonest and viewed unfavorably by a majority of voters. Both campaigns insult the intelligence of the American people. Trump appeals to raw anger, denouncing his opponent as a criminal who should be put in jail. Clinton and the Democrats alternate between portraying Trump as a sexual predator and smearing him as a tool of Moscow. Neither offers any serious program for improving the living standards and social conditions of the working class, the vast majority of the American people. The election campaign is one more sign of the profound dysfunction of the US political system, in which two corporate-controlled parties, each defending the interests of the super-rich, enjoy a political monopoly. The Times /CBS poll is a statistical verification of what the Socialist Equality Party and the World Socialist Web Site have long argued: the two-party system leaves working people disenfranchised. The recourse of both campaigns to personal smears and scandalmongering is a means of evading any discussion of the urgent issues that confront the electorate〞above all, the worsening social crisis and the mounting danger of a third world war. 
Notice the repeat pastings of the same photoshopped groups and individuals in this rally for Hillary. This campaign will go down in history as the apex of dishonesty in US politics, and thats saying something. To cite two examples of developments ignored by both campaigns: Fridays newspapers reported that suicide has overtaken automobile accidents as a cause of death of children aged 10 to 14. One could hardly imagine a more devastating commentary on the dismal prospects that America in 2016 offers the new generation. The election campaign is one more sign of the profound dysfunction of the US political system, in which two corporate-controlled parties, each defending the interests of the super-rich, enjoy a political monopoly . Another report, published in the British Guardian , noted that life expectancy in McDowell County, West Virginia, once the heart of US coal mining, has declined to that of Ethiopia. In 2008, the nearly all-white county voted for Barack Obama. In 2016, 91.5 percent of Republican primary voters cast ballots for Trump〞a vote of indignation and despair. Each of the candidates, in different ways, seeks to direct social tensions within the United States along reactionary lines. Clinton is the candidate of the status quo, representing the alliance of Wall Street, the military-intelligence apparatus and the complacent and self-satisfied upper middle class, where identity politics holds sway. Her program, were she to state it honestly, is to outwardly direct the social crisis in the form of intensified US military violence, first in the Middle East, but ultimately against Russia and China, both of which possess nuclear arsenals. Trump represents an attempt to direct social tensions along extreme nationalist lines, appealing to racist and fascistic forces. While he claims, falsely, to have opposed US military interventions in the Middle East, he glorifies the US military and promises to unleash unlimited violence on any country that resists US demands. In the end, his pledge to Make America Great Again is little more than the English translation of Hitlers slogan, Deutschland 邦ber Alles. That these are the alternatives presented to voters on November 8 is a product of the protracted decay of the US political system. It is more than four decades since the sharp shift to the right began in both parties, in the aftermath of the mass social protests of the 1960s and early 1970s against the Vietnam War and for the extension of civil rights. The Democratic Party abandoned its former commitment to economic improvements for working people and began to restructure itself as the party of Wall Street and identity politics, appealing to newly privileged layers of blacks, women, gays, etc. The Democratic Leadership Council, under its chairman, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, became the vehicle of this transformation. In Hillary Clinton, this rightward movement has reached its culmination. The Democratic candidate has become the consensus choice of the political establishments in both parties. The Republican Party incorporated the former defenders of Jim Crow segregation and became the dominant party in the South, while maintaining its traditional ties to big business and the military. Ronald Reagan kicked off his 1980 presidential campaign with a rally in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where three civil rights workers had been murdered 16 years before, and gave a ringing defense of the Jim Crow Souths slogan of states rights. Trumps embrace by the KKK and the white nationalist alt-right is not an aberration, but the logical conclusion of a process that has paved the way for the emergence of an outright fascist party in America. As Leon Trotsky once wrote, the domination of reaction signifies this, that the social contradictions are mechanically suppressed (Intellectual Ex-Radicals and World Reaction, 1939). The principal mechanism for the suppression of social contradictions in America has been the trade unions. From the late 1970s on, and especially after the smashing of the PATCO air traffic controllers strike in 1981, the AFL-CIO unions have worked systematically to undermine and break strikes, assist the employers in wage cutting and plant closures, and subordinate the working class politically to the ever more right-wing policies of the two capitalist parties. There is a definite limit to this process, however. Today, the unions are as sclerotic and discredited as the bureaucracy in the Soviet Union on the eve of its collapse in 1989-1991. The first signs of a resurgence of the class struggle in America, in a series of contract rejection votes and strikes, have already demonstrated that workers will have to fight not only the corporations and the government, but the unions as well. As the class struggle intensifies, workers will have to develop new forms of organization that make possible a struggle not just at the level of the workplace, but on the plane of national and international politics. The Times /CBS poll confirms the overriding feature of the 2016 campaign: the growing gulf between the American population and the corporate-controlled two-party system. Working people are moving to the left, but the two major parties continue to lurch to the right. In the current election cycle, the political radicalization in the working class was expressed most openly in the mass support for the Democratic primary campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Thirteen million people, including the vast majority of young people who took part in the primaries, voted for a candidate claiming to be a socialist and opponent of the billionaires, an unprecedented political development in America. In the end, Sanders capitulated, endorsed Clinton, and demonstrated that his claim to oppose corporate domination of the political system was a fraud. Working people must draw the necessary conclusions. It is impossible to fight the capitalist class through the two-party system that it controls. The working class must build its own political party to defend its own class interests. This requires a political break, not only with the Democratic Party, but with all those organizations and political tendencies that defend, apologize for and cover up for the Democratic Party. 〞Patrick Martin PLEASE COMMENT AND DEBATE DIRECTLY ON OUR FACEBOOK GROUP CLICK HERE ABOUT THE AUTHOR The author is an editorial writer with wsws.org, organ of theThe Socialist Equality Party (SEP) a Trotkyist formation.

(Wikimedia Commons / Catechetical Guild) The attacks on the planet, civil liberties and human rights are at the core of the American profit-driven, hierarchically-based governing system. While the ultra-rich keep prospering, large swaths of the population are disenfranchised. The tenures of Republican President Ronald Reagan and Democratic President Bill Clinton largely fortified and accelerated these assaults, exemplifying the bipartisan collusion of the elites against regular Americans. Much has been written about the unprecedented inequality in the United States. An additional marker of a society in crisis is the status of the mental health of its population [10] . With policies that have led to the privatization of prisons and health care, the deregulation of an already privatized pharmaceutical industry and a defunding of public mental health clinics, the nation is currently plagued by a mental health crisis that is reflected in a devastating heroin epidemic. But how can a system maintain legitimacy while riddled with such gross corruption and inequality? State means of control T he modern state relies on several techniques to control its populace. Data emanating from research in social psychology, linguistics and behavioral neuroscience has coalesced into a grasp of the workings of the human mind, and how it can be manipulated, i.e. the science of propaganda. This knowledge can be used by commercial corporations to encourage consumption of their products, and is often employed by the state as a means to present a convincing alternative truth, when the real truth is deemed inadequate. Whether it is to promote racism and scapegoating, war or the virtues of a particular politician, the techniques are the same: present biased or partial information to the public to promote a political cause and/or to divert attention from failings that have led to injustice and are likely to rouse dissent that would threaten the regime. In America as in many other parts of the world anticommunist propaganda is embedded in solid, media cultivated ignorance. The anticommunist brainwash afflicting a huge section of the American population produces displays like this〞a complete inversion of truth. Here, the Right 〞playing on the hatreds and fears of the white underclass〞proclaims Obama, a loyal servant of Wall Street and the reigning plutocracy, a sneaky communist. Only the dumbest and most confused of the population can believe that, and yet though mass propaganda, a substantive segment of the population believes such idiocies. But propaganda does not work on everybody. Some people see past the lies and distortions and are either complicit or discontent with the status quo. The latter are either victims of state repression that cannot be ignored or explained away, or intellectuals who study the mechanisms of state repression and propaganda. In order to quell these dissidents, the state enacts policies of surveillance, scapegoating, and criminalization that may lead to incarceration or even assassination. A useful way of assessing the legitimacy of a democratically-elected regime is to examine the extent to which it relies on propaganda to maintain control. It is clear that with growing injustice comes more dissent, which forces the state to either confront the roots of injustice or increase its propaganda to subdue the populace. The militarization of American police forces signifies an acknowledgement of the limitations of repression by propaganda and a shift by the state toward reliance on traditional violence for control. Red-baiting: Then and now One infamous American propaganda campaign was red-baiting, which reached its zenith during the term of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. Red-baiting served the American profit-driven capitalist state well, as any persons categorized as communists/socialists, i.e. advocates for worker rights, were silenced in one way or another. It is no coincidence that Hillary Clintons campaign has been recently ramping up the use of anti-Russian rhetoric [11] , a close relative of red-baiting. This form of propaganda evokes visceral fear reactions in Americans, who share a collective memory of its disastrous effects on individuals and society during the cold war. Fear typically drives people to seek guidance and protection from a strong man/woman. Currently, it is meant to prepare Americans for the possibility of confrontation with Russia and to divert attention from the incriminating information that WikiLeaks is releasing about Hillary Clinton and her shady dealings. In just a few days, the highly stratified American society of 2016, in which lying is idealized [12] , truth-telling villainized [13] , and selfishness hailed as a virtue [14] will choose its next President, which will likely be one of two of the most unpopular candidates ever to run for President. It is evident that in any scenario, Americans can expect a bombardment of propaganda aimed at frightening and rupturing attempts at creating democratic collectives that may serve as alternatives to the corporate state. As the events at Standing Rock Sioux demonstrate well, when traditional propaganda fails, the state will resort to violent repression. SIDEBAR Anti-communist propaganda has always been crude, grotesquely dishonest and unceasing. Heres a sampler, from around the world as the ruling classes of Britain, Germany, France and other nations made sure their populations did not entertain notions of actual equality.

COVER IMAGE: The Great American Dream. A Vision common in the 1950s propaganda. That finding fits along with others, such as that the economic ＆recovery after Barack Obama came into the White House in 2009, went virtually entirely to the very rich. .. According to the top experts on wealth-inequality in the United States, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, American wealth-inequality soared faster during 2003-2013 than ever since the period 1923-1928, right before the Great Crash of 1929. Their study Wealth Inequality in the United States Since 1913 , published in the May 2016 Quarterly Journal of Economics , reported that ever since the remilitarization of the U.S. from the 2003 invasion of Iraq onward (and continuing under Obama, with boosts to NATO, and invasions such as of Libya in 2011), the percentage of total wealth owned by the richest .1% of American families (those families whose net worth was $111 million or higher) rose from 15% of the total in 2003, to 22% of the total in 2013, and this means that the percentage going to the lower 99.9% declined from 85% down to 78% during that time. .. Americas soaring inequality during the George W. Bush Presidency continued unaffected by the 2009 change of Presidential Administrations. 
.. The dream is now a cruel joke for most Americans, all due to their political ignorance, a treacherous media, and the runaway criminality they have allowed in their political and corporate classes. In fact: whereas Bushs stock-market plunge in 2006-2008 hit the richest the hardest, Obamas coming into office restored their lost wealth rapidly, while the wealth of the bottom 90% of the U.S. population flatlined throughout his Presidency. The Obama economic recovery was no recovery at all for the bottom 90% of Americans. Not just wealth but personal income also soared for the super-rich under Obama. The Share of income earned by top 0.1% wealth holders soared throughout Obamas Presidency, at least up through 2012, which is the latest figure shown there for that. So: at least the bottom 90% of U.S. families have experienced none of the Obama economic recovery; what ＆recovery from the ＆recession there is, went only to the very rich. .. Findings such as those are consistent with, and might help to explain, the finding in the new Brookings study, that 96% of House districts have experienced increased poverty under Obama. The nations poor have gotten political rhetoric, but not much else, and the middle class also have received no net benefit, under Obama.

This is an historic election in so many ways. Let me point out a few: The first time that a woman was the Presidential candidate of the duopoly. The first time in the modern era when a direct member of the .01% without any knowledge or background in politics was the Presidential candidate of the duopoly. The first time that BOTH candidates were hated and mistrusted by the majority of the voting public  regardless of party. 
Now that the ＆firsts are out of the way, let me deal with my real concerns about this election. 
We live in a time when the world is literally a political tinder box, and the United States seems bent on adding fuel and throwing Molotov cocktails all over the place. 
We live in a time when the Earth teeters on the brink of runaway climate and ecological catastrophe. We are literally at a point where most climate scientists are saying that we are near or PAST the point of no return with climate  the point where we could avoid devastating, civilization destroying, extinction level event (ELE) catastrophe. Every single eco-system, and every ecological region on the planet is degraded and many are collapsing. 
This issue of the environment is deeply pertinent to the U.S. presidential election because one of the duopoly candidates rabidly does NOT believe in global warming. In fact, this candidate wants to disband the entire Environmental Protection Agency and reverse all environmental protections  from pollution to endangered species. (Frankly, this candidate wants to get rid of ALL regulations and treaties and apparently, most laws  they get in the way of business). Can you guess which candidate this is?

I have watched as much of the left has joined the far right Tea Partiers and alt-right white power movement in promoting Donald Trump as the better of the two candidates for President. The ＆Lefts argument at base is that The Establishment is against Trump so he must be better than Hillary Clinton (who obviously represents The Establishment). The fact is that the Left is standing with those who are ideologically (supposedly) 180 o from the Left I thought I knew. 
The Left I thought I knew was anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, pro-social justice, pro-collectivity, and environmentally conscious. Yet most seem to have decided that standing with those who are white-centric, xenophobic, misogynistic, imperialistic, pro-corporate, anti-science, anti-intellectual, and anti-environmentalism, is the ＆common ground against The Establishment. I am sorry, but the logic eludes me. 
These same Left Trumpers argue that he is less militaristic and hawkish than Clinton, even thought Trump has said that he wants to dramatically increase the military (the only part of the government he seems to have a use for since they would be tied to his command). He wants to upgrade and USE the nuclear arsenal. His solution to ISIS (and other pesky folk in the Middle East) is to nuke them. He wants to re-take Iraq and get their oil. In fact, he thinks that we should just take over the resources wherever we want. He also wants to make Iran straighten up fast (everything is going to happen fast) or presumably he will nuke them too. Then there is clearly a lot of money to be made in nukes and he wants to sell them to everyone. I have not found one thing that is less hawkish about Trump other than he seems to like Putin. Of course that could change on a dime if he gets pissed off at Putin. 
Trump is different than the ordinary candidate, and what he has done is step to the front of a movement. It is a movement that is now clearly fascist. Even many on the Left recognize that Trump is a fascist (there have been various comparisons to Mussolini), but there has been virtually no discussion of the movement that has not only been empowered by Trump, but is now legitimated as a political organization, part of the power structure and sitting at the table  via Trump. And the racist Right (aka alt-right) is well aware of it. Trump says that there will be riots if he is not elected. The implied threat is of heavily armed militias in the streets and not peaceful protestors expressing their disgust and distrust. 
I have to wonder at how the Left has changed. We have arrived at a point where the Left (reluctantly of course) stands behind a fascist (and a fascist movement) for President of the most powerful nation on the planet. Please keep that in mind. No matter the degraded economic position of the United States, we have the largest arsenal and largest military on the planet by several magnitudes. Who is elected here matters more than ANY other country on the planet. 
So I am sad, and bereft. My country is sliding into chaos. My planet is rushing towards disaster. And the people I thought stood with me have lined up behind a narcissistic, vengeful, fascist for President. 
Oh we missed the opportunity of a lifetime. The Left could have gotten behind Sanders. No he was not perfect, but he was damn well a significant move LEFT. The Left could have looked at what was happening (given the popularity of Sanders and Trump, the two perceived anti-establishment candidates) and put forward a real viable candidate  Jill Stein. With the massive dislike of both Clinton and Trump, we might have actually pulled off a real coup and gotten the Greens into the White House. That ship has sailed. 
I do not support Clinton. I do not think she is a good candidate. I do think she is sane  though self-serving. I do know just how much of a hawk she is, and that she is more than happy to continue the agenda that both neo-cons and neo-libs have been pushing since 2000 (if not earlier). 
Regardless of who wins this farce of an election, Trump and his version of Brown Shirts are going to be with us for a long time. I am left to wonder how the Left that risked their lives fighting Mussolini and Franco are now standing behind Trump. 
I have no illusions about the malignancy of Clinton, but I also have no illusions about the malignancy of Trump. The fact that Clinton is the Democratic candidate speaks to the fact that she puts her right to be the first woman candidate, and the first woman U.S. president, above the fate of the country speaks volumes. It was clear that if Sanders was the candidate, Trump would not even be on the radar, much less in a dead heat for the presidency. It is now known that the DNC (with the help of MSM) sunk Sanders. Of course, much of the Left had nothing but trash talk for Sanders. It is also now known that Sanders put his political position as a senator above the needs of the country and got in line behind Clinton rather than refusing to support her and jumping over to the Green Party ticket (which speaks clearly as to where the hearts of Stein and Baraka are). 
In talking and corresponding with folks on the Left, I have heard that many are not even planning to vote. This includes the authors of a number of the anti-Clinton, pro-Trump pieces. This is stunning to me and a double blow as what they are doing is purely trying to influence the votes of others. In other words, propaganda. That some of my comrades would turn their pens and efforts to propaganda to influence the votes of others, and not devote that energy to promoting real candidates for real change leaves me tremendously disillusioned about the Left and what the goal actually is. I had thought that we were aiming for a world of justice and equality, of humane treatment of all  including the planet itself, of true education and intellectual development, of support for creativity and the importance of it in a healthy society. Now I find that the apparent goal is to bring down society at any cost, and surely that cost will be high for little good arises from chaos. Rather, the most self oriented and violent responses are maximized when people feel they are fighting for survival. This is not what I have spent a life time fighting for and it is not what I will fight for now. 
My voting advice is as follows: 
Find out how the vote is running in your state. If Clinton is leading by a significant margin, vote for Stein and Baraka. If there is not that margin, then vote for Clinton. We have an electoral College- not a majority vote. That puts the electoral college members in each state as the voter for each state. 
Another option is vote swapping through a system like #NeverTrump . And yes, it is legal to do this. 
Vote for the down ballot. Vote for the most progressive candidate that has any chance of winning. Why? Because if Trump wins we will need them to help stop the slide into fascism. If Hillary Clinton wins, we need them to keep her from the the continued plans of regime change. 
One thing I know for sure  we have a long struggle before us to get back to the point where we can embrace the diversity and richness of our culture, and to fully address the structured inequality that is robbing us of lives and potential every day. We were obviously NOT there before this election process, and we will be a damn sight further away from it afterwards. When hate becomes socially acceptable, we are all damaged, and lessened, and all life is cheapened. 
Is this the person you want for President of the United State? Would you trust him with your life?

Regardless of who becomes the next president, this election will forever be synonymous with the rogue candidacy of Donald Trump and the demographic shifts that have emboldened the right. Though it may be a close election, it is widely presumed that public antipathy towards Trump  the first major party candidate who is near-universally opposed by both major parties  will tilt the odds in Hillary Clintons favour. Nonetheless, Trumps support base of primarily white, blue-collar Americans will be a major factor for the political establishment to contend with in the years ahead. These voters are frustrated by their economic marginalisation wrought by neoliberal trade deals and economic policies and are contemptuous of traditional political elite, their internationalism and liberal identity politics. For these voters, fear of immigration is entwined with the precarity of being working class, their troubling prejudices notwithstanding. Economic disempowerment and political disenfranchisement have accelerated under President Obama, to the detriment of the American middle class. White, blue-collar Americans have witnessed the offshoring of their jobs and the erosion of their status in society, and Trump has masterfully stroked their resentment and discontent by playing on their fears of Muslims, immigrants and minorities. Trumps views often contain unusual contradictions and seem to be delivered impromptu. What remains consistent are his authoritarian views on crime and justice, vows to close the borders to refugees, Muslims and economic migrants, scepticism of overseas ＆democracy promotion and Americas role in international alliances, foreign policy views both isolationist and belligerent and of course, his distinctive megalomaniacal hubris. Trumps real problem with the Washington establishment is that he isnt part of it. His campaign represents an insurgent faction of the oligarchical class that aims to displace and replace the standing political elites. Bipartisan opposition to Trump is grounded in the belief that he would be an unreliable proxy and a liability, someone too narrow and unpredictable to manage the common affairs of the ruling class and the US deep state. Moreover, the US establishment is not interested in being led by such a contentious figure, who would draw protest and public opposition in a way that more conventional establishment candidates largely do not. For example, Trumps rhetoric on immigration seems to engender more public outrage than the immigration policy under Obama, who has deported more people than any other president in history. That being said, Hillary Clinton is a more dangerous candidate in many ways. Trump understands that the political system is rigged and the economy is oriented to serve various elite interests, a message that resonates across the political spectrum, even with anti-Trump segments of the electorate. As a hated political outsider not tied directly into the power and the money structure of the political system, there would be no shortage of gridlock and checks on the authority wielded by Trump in the unlikely event that he becomes president. By contrast, Clinton wields enormous political influence inside the corridors of political and corporate power through personal relationships and connections. Policy and legislation shaped by donor money, lobbyist groups and special interests have been a hallmark of the Clintons time in public office. The very fact that she is standing for office while being investigated by the FBI, having committed actions that would have ended the careers of other politicians and government employees, speaks for itself. It has been reported by various sources that the FBIs recent decision to reopen the investigation into the Clinton email scandal less than two weeks before election day has been motivated by an internal backlash within the agencys rank and file, forcing FBI director James Comeys hand as a means of addressing internal critics who believe he buried the Clinton probe for political reasons. Clintons email scandal is not the real issue. She has spent her political career ruthlessly advancing the interests of high finance, the military industrial complex and corporate America, with dramatic repercussions for minorities and the marginalised inside the United States, and the civilian populations of countries targeted for US military intervention and destabilization during the her time as an influential first lady, senator and secretary of state. Clinton has spent her long career advocating hawkish US military supremacy and banking deregulation, expanding the private prison industry to the detriment of impoverished African-American communities, dismantling the social safety net that marginalised families rely on, and enabling the consolidation of corporate power through secretive trade agreements. On the campaign trail, she has characterised her work as advancing the interests of women and families. Rather than addressing the political substance of revelations uncovered by WikiLeaks, the Clinton campaign, backed by Obama administration officials, has reverted to neo-McCarthyism by labelling opposition voices as surrogates of Russia, explicitly accusing Moscow of meddling in the US election process. The Clinton campaign has repeatedly evoked the historic struggle for civil rights and aspirational rhetoric of ＆breaking glass ceilings in the interest of a faux-feminism which prioritizes the equal opportunities of women to lead the nations highest office, while at once tone-deaf to the consequences faced by women and families on the receiving end of executive policies. The Democratic Party has become a parody of moral posturing, self-relishing its candidates with rhetoric that has no connection with policies in reality. It is the party of establishment insiders and corporate donors who openly engineer the presidential nomination process to favour their preferred candidate by virtue of the undemocratic super-delegate system. Bernie Sanders, whose campaign inspired millions of Americans for good reason, has proven himself to be tepid and cowardly in the face of practices that have proven beyond doubt that the Democratic Party establishment conspired against him. Bernies campaign centred around a rather modest, comparatively tame centre-left progressive platform that did not seriously question US militarism and the values of American exceptionalism. For the Democratic Party at large, the Sanders campaign represented a concession too far. The Clinton campaign even had the impudence to directly hire disgraced Democratic chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz after leaked emails exposed her partisanship. Rather than addressing the political substance of revelations uncovered by WikiLeaks, the Clinton campaign, backed by Obama administration officials, has reverted to neo-McCarthyism by labelling opposition voices as surrogates of Russia, explicitly accusing Moscow of meddling in the US election process. Accusations of Russian interference without accompanying evidence are at best a short-sighted means of deflecting responsibility for the corrupt actions of the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party insiders. The next American president will have to confront the realities of strained relations with Russia. Clinton is known for her public enmity toward Russian President Vladimir Putin and would at best perpetuate the status quo of mutual distrust and limited cooperation. At worst, her policies could risk a military confrontation with Russia should she pursue the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syrian airspace, which she publically advocated during the presidential debates. Trump is the most prominent American political figure to advocate dtente with Russia, openly breaking with his neoconservative running mate Mike Pence. Trump has criticised Clinton for supporting anti-government insurgents in Syria and called for jointly targeting ISIS with the Russian, and by extension, Syrian militaries. Trump, being very critical of Iran, also signalled he was willing to fight against ISIS on the same side as Tehran. He has also offered support for the establishment of a safe zone inside Syrian territory, potentially in cooperation with the Syrian government and its allies. Both candidates would pursue a different policy approach from the incumbent administration in Syria, but Clintons no-fly zone holds greater potential to deepen military hostilities between major powers. Clinton has generally been critical of Obamas foreign policy in Syria and elsewhere for not asserting US power strongly enough. Despite the differences in style and demeanour, the range of policies offered by the entrenched two-party system is limited to varying shades of centre- to far-right. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are the least trusted and most unpopular presidential candidates in modern history. Despite the public disillusionment with major party candidates, it remains to be seen whether American voters will cast ballots for third parties such as the Libertarian Party or Green Party, which are seeking to garner 5 percent of the popular vote to become eligible to receive public campaign funding. More likely than not, American voters will cast their ballots ＆against Trump by voting for Clinton and vice versa, fueling the cyclical politics of the lesser evil that have been a feature of American presidential elections for decades. More than any other US election in recent history, the candidates represent the rot of an American political establishment marred by scandal, hypocrisy and the relentless pursuit of hegemony. To advocate one over the other is ultimately defeatist.

Emigre Super Blocs Part VIII:The Quasi-Legal Coup-Hillary Clinton Information Operations In Election 2016 . The purpose of  Inform and Influence Operations  is not to provide a perspective, opinion, or lay out a policy. It is defined as the ability to make audiences think and act in a manner favorable to the mission objectives. This is done through applying perception management techniques which target the audiences emotions, motives, and reasoning.
These techniques are not geared for debate. It is to overwhelm and change the target psyche. 
Using these techniques information sources can be manipulated and those that write, speak, or think counter to the objective are relegated as propaganda, ill-informed, or irrelevant. ~ Global Research, US Psychological Warfare in Ukraine . 
W hat if the strife, rumor, and clamor that the world has seen in the presidential campaign were part and parcel of an Inform and Influence Operation against Americans to determine the election outcome? Bear with me for a moment as I lay out the proofs. The quote above is from an early 2015 article with the author showing what it could look like in the civilian world. 
 What would we do? Disrupt, deny, degrade, deceive, corrupt, usurp or destroy the information. The information, please dont forget, is the ultimate objective of cyber. That will directly impact the decision-making process of the adversarys leader who is the ultimate target.  Joel Harding 
IO or IIO (Inform and Influence Operations) as defined by the US Army includes the fields of psychological operations and military deception. All of this is used in the civilian world the same way by private contractors. 
In this election, private contractors were hired to focus their capacity to influence the American population. This is proven and you deserve a step by step look at it if you are voting. 
What Project Veritas shows is damning evidence of what I have been documenting in the emigre series articles since spring 2016. 
By using mainstream media, they started an integrated approach which includes influencing their political opponents decision making. Media is given messages that follow the same themes and fill the entire information space by using an across the board effort. The effort drowns out any other message. 
According to the Observer, this has been happening throughout the election cycle to benefit Hillary Clinton.  Rather than informing voters to enrich democracy , the mainstream media has developed a feedback loop between support for particular candidates and the political agenda they intend to support. The freedom of the press is necessary for a democracy to function. The article further points out that it was the media that helped rig the primaries against Bernie Sanders. 
Wikileaks has clearly shown the interplay between mainstream media and the Clinton campaign. And they have shown clearly that most of the mainstream media are working to influence the election . This goes beyond partisan electioneering. All of this follows the exact pattern, a well planned Information Operation against the American public . 
As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was also the Ex-Officio Board Member of the BBG . The BBG (Broadcasting Board of Governors) run RFE/RL (Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty). Most of the 8-member board, appointed by the President of the United States, are the whos who of powerful media moguls in film, news, print, and radio. Appointment to the BBG is like being awarded an ambassador position for the media industry. Its also why big media carries the same line or themes. 
The 7th member of the board of directors which runs RFE/RL is Mathew Armstrong . He is a longtime friend and mentor to retired Brigadier general Joel Harding. He provides Harding a lot of access and influence in media. Armstrongs background is public relations. He is an expert in IO and IIO operations. His bio: Author, lecturer, and strategist on public diplomacy and international media . He has worked on traditional and emerging security issues with both civilian and military government agencies, news organizations, think tanks, and academia across several continents. 
In what appears to be a conflict of interest, at least two BBG board members are working actively for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. 
Karen Kornbluh is helping refine and to get Hillary Clintons message out.  All of them are names to watch if Clinton wins 〞 and key jobs at the FCC and other federal agencies are up for grabs. 
According to her bio : Karen founded the New America Foundations Work and Family Program and is a senior fellow for Digital Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. Karen has written extensively about technology policy, women, and family policy for The Atlantic , The New York Times and The Washington Post . New York Times columnist David Brooks cited her Democracy article Families Valued, focused on juggler families as one of the best magazine articles of 2006. Michael Kempner is the founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of MWW Group, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, and may get a greater role if she is elected . Kempner is a member of the Public Relations Hall of Fame. Michael Kempner hired Anthony Weiner after the sexting scandal broke in 2011. 
Jeff Shell, chairman of the BBG and Universal Filmed Entertainment is supporting a secondary role by being an honor roll donor to the Atlantic Council . While the BBG is supposed to be neutral it has continuously helped increase tensions in Eastern Europe. While giving to the Atlantic Council may not be illegal while in his position, currently, the Atlantic Councils main effort is to ignite a war with Russia. This may set up a major conflict of interest. 
According to journalist Robert Parry The people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe This consensus is driven by a broad-based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East. 
Parry goes on to say that at the forefront of this is the Atlantic Council, a think tank associated with NATO. Their main goal is a major confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. 
The Atlantic Council is the think tank for the CEEC (Central and Eastern European Coalition) which is associated with NATO. The CEEC has only one goal. The question it poses to candidates that mattered is Are you willing to go to war with Russia? Hillary Clinton has received their unqualified support throughout the campaign. 
The Central and Eastern European Coalition represent the various Central and Eastern European countries to the US government. What makes them special in an election is that they control a 20 million person strong bloc vote in key states across the country and sway elections by themselves. The price of a Clinton win is war with Russia. 
While the rest of the BBG board support Clintons proposed policy of closing Syrian airspace, the CEEC wants it because it will mean direct conflict with Russia. Hillary Clintons first foray into Islamic politics led to genocide and made the way for ISIS setting up training camps in Kosovo. Hillary Clinton has been friendly with jihadists for as long as she has had a national political career. According to US Special Forces on the ground in Syria training the moderates, there are NO moderates to train . 
Green Berets are forced to train jihadis that they know will eventually attack us. Support our troops? Give them good, honorable missions. They deserve better, dont they? 
As you go through the above links, the information is staggering. Shown are large groups of people strategically located in swing states that will do anything to get her elected. The question is why? 
Politically, we have a two party system. If you say you are Republican, people have at least a general idea of what you mean. For Democrats, its no different. There are different kinds of politics that fit easily under each umbrella. But the point is they are recognizable and we know where they stand on issues. 
Tell me, what are OUNb beliefs? OUNb is a political party and set of beliefs just like Republican or Democrat. The reason I am asking is that you cant tell me. The odds are you havent heard about it before. When the Atlantic Council or The Project for the New American Century takes all the senior positions in the Clinton White House, it will be filled with OUNb and similar political partisans for the first time without dissenting voices. 
Unity to act when required has been the diasporas mantra  this cannot be disputed . 
As time moves on, we see that things take a natural course. We see that two wings of the OUN  (OUNb)Banderivtsi and (OUNm)Melnykivtsi  are working actively on the international level, working in partnership and currently are in strong negotiations about becoming a single entity again. 
The OUNb political party started under Stepan Bandera and their political beliefs are quite literally Nazi. In the 1930s they swore undying loyalty to Adolf Hitler and the Diaspora was directing Waffen SS battalions from America secretly even as other Ukrainian emigres were fighting them. The UCCA is the head of OUNb thought in America and now they want America to celebrate their totalitarian beliefs with them. If you disagree with totalitarian politics, you are the enemy. After a brief description of what kind of beliefs the people have from the Atlantic Council that are taking up cabinet positions, the proof it is happening now follows. 
The OUNb were the SS that manned the concentration camps during the Holocaust. They successfully murdered 3 million war prisoners by starving them to death. The OUNb killed over 250,000 Jews, 500,000 Ukrainians, and committed the first Holocaust at Babi Yar. Today the UCCA is funding and running the volunteer battalions raping and killing in Donbass the same way. 
They and the other emigre group leaders are also behind buying the media headlines and reach, damage control, and the Information Operation against Americans today. If you want to know what American politics will look like within a few years, look at Ukraine. 
There are people who live abroad, who do not feel fully accepted as a minority, and here there is a phenomenon which I call long-distance nationalism. . .The members of the diaspora create for themselves an image of the home land, which is a stronger emotional investment than the country in which they live＃One negative consequence of the diaspora experience is the emergence of what Ander-son calls non-responsible politics: diaspora participation in the politics in the country with which they identify can often be toxic, and their impact can be felt through the funding of particular political figures, nationalist propaganda, and even weapons＃- Multiculturalism, memory, and ritualization: Ukrainian nationalist monuments in Edmonton, Alberta  Pers Anders Rudling 
With the field day the Emigres and paid media had with Donald Trump over David Duke, they forgot to tell you that Ukrainian emigres supporting Hillary Clinton hired Duke in Ukraine as a professor of history and sent their American kids to learn there. Almost all Ukrainian politicians have been through this fascist education system known as MAUP . The Ukrainian American and other likeminded ethnics are the people that will fill the senior foreign and domestic cabinet positions. 
 OUNb leader Ivan Kobasa also took responsibility of making sure the Ukrainian-Americans received the proper secondary education at Ukrainian nationalist schools(MAUP) in Ukraine. From the mid-2000s enrollment in this educational system has skyrocketed into the hundreds of thousands. Today almost all members of the current Ukrainian government are graduates of this ideological system that was taught to them by moderates like David Duke who is also a graduate of the MAUP system. 
I do care about social and economic issues affecting every American, but given the war in Ukraine, there is only one issue that we as Ukrainian Americans must focus on: Ukraine . 
The Ukrainian issue trumps all other personal issues! 
A vote for Trump is a vote against Ukraine! 
When it comes to U.S. elections, Ukrainian Americans are a statistically minor, divided, unorganized voting group. The Central and East European Coalition is a coalition of U.S.-based organizations that represent their countries of heritage, a voting group of over 20 million people. The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America and the Ukrainian National Association are member organizations of the CEEC. Americans of East and Central European heritage can make a significant difference and influence the election result if their attention is focused. Ukraine Weekly The Presidential Election: Can We Make A Difference 
Hillary Clintons response is she will defend Ukraines borders! Even though it has no eastern or northern border to defend. She has guaranteed to start a war with Russia if she is elected. 
Not only is Clinton buying the media through these second parties, but they are hiring professional, former military psyops professionals to deny pertinent information from voters and disrupt her political opponents message. At the same time, they are paying an across the board mainstream media to simultaneously publish articles and video that lift her campaign up, disrupt, destroy, and drown out alternate messages. 
Wikileaks noted this when it exposed the Clinton campaigns program to incite violence and obfuscate the point. The Huffington Post example of this is Editors note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims 〞 1.6 billion members of an entire religion 〞 from entering the U.S. 
 We understand the Clinton camp has hired beaucoup and Zwanzig (a lot) of trolls, we also understand the Kremlin has done the same. We just do not know if Trump has followed suit. From a counterintelligence perspective, this is confusing as heck. 
One of the really neat things about this election is seeing all my information operations and information warfare friends on social media, contributing and commenting, looking darned intelligent! Theirs is normally the voice of reason, maturity, and intelligence. Joel Harding 
By systematically and continually attacking the voters psyche, Americans are being treated in the same way our government treats countries they overthrow . The right to make an informed vote has been denied to support any particular candidate. 
What does an Inform and Influence Operation entail against the American public? Read the following carefully. The term anti-western refers to anyone that disagrees with whom he is working for. In this case, he works for the Ukrainian Emigres. This also covers Syria. Every media outlet or journalist writing about these subjects that arent carrying the line he lays out is the enemy. These are the tactics being used today during the election. 
I am building a database of planners , operators, logisticians, hackers, and anyone wanting to be involved with special activities I will call ＆inform and influence activities. I have received a few different suggestions to help organize operations  of all sorts  against anti-Western elements. No government approval, assistance or funding. This skirts legalities. This is not explicitly illegal and it may not even be legal, at this point. That grey area extends a long way. I am only trying to assess the availability of people willing to participate in such efforts. Technology, equipment and facility offers are also appreciated. If you would like to be included in my database, please send a tailored resume to joel_harding@

As a litmus test take Hillarys name out and put down what is known just through Wikileaks in a list. Put McCains name, Kucinich, Paul, Bush, and ask yourself would this be an acceptable candidate? Add whats been shown here. Is there an acceptable candidate? 
If any of them would be acceptable, sorry like many others you drank the kool-aid already. 
 Ive seen how our heroes, activists , journalists, and celebrities have completely sold their souls to support something no person with an iota of morality would do. Ive seen them say and do things to derail candidates who would have been a million times better for those less fortunate around us. Its unfortunate most pretend to fight the establishment, to act like they love the people more than they love the struggle and the relevance that it brings them. I am not one of those and I wont continue to be until the good Lord takes me. Cesar Vargas 
Hillary Clinton is not a Nazi. But every position of relevance will be filled with people that really are political Nazis. They are technically integral nationalists. They look down on democracy in any form. At least now you know what kind of government you are voting for. 
Regardless of who wins, there are 2000 tanks, artillery, and rockets pointed my way, waiting for this election to be over. I am an American that lives in Donbass, and wrote many of the early breaking stories and much of the background about the conflict in Ukraine. 
If you cannot objectively look and see a more sophisticated version of what happened here through 2014 is going on, I cant help you. Soon the OUNb will order the volunteer battalions to start killing civilians on a large scale again. I will go back to reporting on the war. 
If all these things werent being done, I would keep it simply about policy. Russia is not an enemy of the United States. Instead, I believe I am witnessing a quiet coup that demands legality in America. 
If this Information Operation is allowed to win the 2016 presidency, then elections are fruitless. Every other election will be based on the same strategy. They will have to be for any candidate to win.

On Sunday, CBS News 60 Minutes featured a focus group discussion of the elections. When asked by pollster Frank Luntz for a word to describe how they felt about the more than a year-and-a-half election campaign, the participants responded: terrified, exasperating, horrifying, disgusted and nightmare. The fact that the two main candidates, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, are the most widely despised in the history of presidential politics has been substantiated in innumerable polls. But the contempt felt toward the two candidates expresses a deeper alienation from the entire structure of official capitalist politics. The candidates and the media have ignored the social, economic and political issues that concern the overwhelming majority of the people. The official election debates〞in which each candidate denounced the others criminality〞embarrassed and disgusted the electorate. Both Clinton and Trump personify, each in their own way, the corrupt and reactionary character of the political system. What is the choice that has been given the American people? It is hard to say which of the candidates offered by the two parties is more right-wing, the difference being more a matter of style than substance. While the demagogue Trump is trying to direct social discontent along fascistic lines, Clinton is using the cynical narrative of race and gender to provide a progressive mask for an agenda of war and the continuation of economic policies that have guaranteed an endless flow of cash into the pockets of the super-rich. The verdict of Wall Street on its prospects under a Clinton presidency could be seen in the reaction of stock markets to the announcement by FBI Director James Comey that the agency is not pursuing criminal charges against Clinton over her emails. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 371 points. The Clinton campaign has marshaled behind it significant sections of the Republican Party establishment, including many of the neoconservative architects of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Democratic Party campaign, well aware of its candidates unpopularity, is relying on the oldest form of political blackmail to bring out the vote for Hillary Clinton. She is, the party and its apologists insist, the lesser evil. As bad as Clinton is, the argument goes, she must be supported to avert the disaster that would inevitably follow the election of Trump. The problem with the lesser evil argument is that it leads to results that are worse than what those who voted one way or the other were hoping to prevent. The terrible Trump theory of American politics explains nothing. The nomination of this absurd and obscene blowhard is itself an outcome of the deep crisis of American society. He is the political equivalent of the metastatic spread of a primary and deadly tumor. Trump is the product of a corporate-dominated political culture, which, for at least the last 40 years, has promoted social backwardness and reaction. However, it is too simple to blame Fox News, talk radio and campaign finance laws for the nomination of Trump. The popular response to his demagogic slogans reflects genuine social distress. Many workers who are planning on voting for him today previously backed the Democratic Party campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. One of the main consequences of Sanders efforts to channel his political revolution behind Clinton was to guarantee that social anger and hostility to the status quo would be identified with the political right. In the final analysis, Trumps rise is a product of the political bankruptcy of the Democratic Party. Unable to present a positive political message that can attract mass support, Clinton has waged her campaign against Trump on the lowest and most reactionary level. First, the Democrats and their media flacks have denounced Trump as an agent of the Russian president, asserting that Vladimir Putin is seeking to influence the elections by hacking Democratic Party emails. This claim has been endlessly repeated without any factual substantiation. The repackaging of McCarthyite red-baiting, with Russia replacing the Soviet Union, has been used to distract attention from the content of the emails released by WikiLeaks. The Democratic Party campaign, well aware of its candidates unpopularity, is relying on the oldest form of political blackmail to bring out the vote for Hillary Clinton. She is, the party and its apologists insist, the lesser evil. As bad as Clinton is, the argument goes, she must be supported to avert the disaster that would inevitably follow the election of Trump. More dangerously, the relentless anti-Putin propaganda has been employed by Clinton to legitimize a massive escalation of military operations in Syria and against Russia in the aftermath of the election. The extreme danger of world war, which has been ignored throughout the election, was underscored by the announcement Monday that NATO is placing 300,000 troops on high alert, supposedly in response to Russian aggression. Second, as the election reached its final stage, the Democrats escalated their hysterical slanders based on the claim that Trumps support is coming from privileged white workers motivated by the racist desire to return to an era when they ruled the country. Clinton has centered her campaign on a racialist narrative that denies the deep social anger felt among workers of all races. In terms of social policy, Clinton is pledged to continue the policies of the Obama administration, which has overseen a massive transfer of wealth to the rich and the return of social inequality to the historic levels that prevailed in the first decades of the twentieth century. In the days leading up to the election, millions of workers were confronted with the news that their health insurance premiums will rise by double digits, the outcome of Obamas signature domestic initiative, the misnamed Affordable Care Act. Regardless of the outcome, todays vote will not solve anything. Nothing that happens on Election Day is going to lead to a rise in living standards, resolve any of the great social problems facing the working class, or put an end to the danger of world war. It will only establish the framework for the next stage of the political crisis in the United States. This political crisis will have far-reaching and global consequences. Media commentators internationally have followed what is happening in the United States with a mixture of shock and horror. Edward Luce, writing in the British Financial Times , sums up the prevailing anxiety in a comment published Sunday under the headline, American democracys gravest trial. The American political system, he writes, is teetering, whatever the outcome of the US elections. Luce asks his readers to imagine two kinds of threat: one where a bear [Trump] breaks into your cabin, the other where termites eat it from within. The good thing about a bear, he writes, is that you can see it coming. In contrast, Termites are invisible. It is hard to pinpoint when they began to eat away at the foundation. When and why did Americans lose faith in their system? The reactionary spectacle of the 2016 elections is the product of protracted decay. Twenty-five years ago, the ideologists of American capitalism proclaimed that the dissolution of the Soviet Union marked the end of history, with the United States, the dominant and unchallenged world power, guaranteeing liberal democracy the world over. If nothing else, this election will forever bury this reactionary fantasy. The crisis confronting the United States today is no less profound than the situation that faced the Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union a quarter-century ago. Four decades of declining living standards and growing social inequality, a quarter-century of unending war, fifteen years of the war on terror accompanied by a vast expansion of the power of the military-intelligence apparatus: These are the pressures that are tearing the democratic fabric apart. Nor is the crisis expressed in this election a uniquely American phenomenon. It is paralleled by global shocks such as the Brexit referendum in Britain, the rise of far-right and fascistic movements throughout Europe, and the general discrediting of political institutions throughout the world. Underlying everything is a crisis of world capitalism, manifested in an expanding imperialist war drive that threatens the entire planet, and the growth of the class struggle, which is the objective foundation for socialist revolution. The time for pragmatic lesser evil politics has long since passed. The pressing and urgent necessity is to build a party of the working class, uniting workers of every race, gender, nationality and ethnicity on a program that represents their class interests.

Clinton. The organization is also the largest LGBTQ political group. The HRC has endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.
Their new video advertisement features Clintons pledge to fight for the LGBT communitys equality. The ad was also released days before the election on Nov. 8.
The video titled Hillary Clinton: Equality Is About Changing Hearts And Minds, was released in Washington D.C., which is the HRC headquarters are located.
The organization has a section of their website dedicated to the groups endorsement of the candidate. The HRC also stated that Clinton has stood with the LGBTQ community and the group will now stand with Clinton. The HRC concluded by saying that Clintons fight is with the community and that what the HRC advocates.
The HRC President Chad Griffin said that Clinton has shown through her words and actions that she is dedicated to fighting for the rights of the LGBT community. He also stated that all of the progress the community has made is at stake in the 2016 Presidential election as the HRC has endorsed a candidate in the 2016 election.
Griffin then continued to state that Donald Trumps campaign is filled with hateful language that will reverse the LGBTQ movements gains. He also said that Clinton will tear down the walls of bigotry against people of alternative lifestyles. The HRC leader concluded by saying that it is very important that people who are pro-equality voters for Clinton in the next presidential election.
Breitbart stated that an artist from the Art Wing Conspiracy group said a lot of Trump supporters, especially amongst the LGBT community, are in the closet. The artistic group has painted several Think Different posters across the city of San Francisco near the offices of Twitter and Clintons campaign headquarters. The posters feature a rainbow Apple logo with a silhouette of Trumps face on it. They were released on National Coming Out Day.
The Art Wing Conspiracy artist also stated that on National Coming Out Day the organization encourages people to stop living a lie and come out. He conveyed this idea, in a voting booth, i.e. a closet, no one has to know who supports Trump or Clinton.
The artist also said that the liberal community in San Francisco must know that there are many Trump supporters amongst the citys LGBT community. The individual stated that having pride means to be true to oneself and ones beliefs, even if it is against the mainstream. The artist concluded that is what the LGBT rights movement conveys.
The Stonewall Inns website stated that the historic inn was the birthplace of the historic LGBT rights movement. The patrons of the club retaliated against harassment from the local police department. Subsequently, a riot occurred on June 28, 1969.
The website also claimed that the patrons refused to accept the status quo of oppression for the first time. They then stood up for each other and the whole LGBT community.
The site continues to state that the riot at the Stonewall Inn sparked the lengthy battle for all members of the Gay and Lesbian community. The incident is often referred to as the Rosa Parks incident of the LGBT community. The site then stated that the incident led the government and society, in general, to look at members of the LBGT community as equals.
In 1969 the police raided gay clubs regularly. Eight police officers arrived at the Stonewall Inn on a Saturday morning at 1:20. Approximately 200 people were in the establishment that night. However, the raid was not conducted as planned. The patrons did not cooperate, resulting in the riot that led to the LGBT rights movement of the 1970s, which is why the HRC now exists and has endorsed a candidate for the 2016 election.

Currently, he is serving Assembly District 8 (AD8) as a Republican and has changed parties to seek re-election as a Libertarian for the November 8, 2016, legislative election. Moreover, before he was a right-wing politician, he ran for office as Democrat. One could certainly question where this candidates allegiances lie.
John Moores Legislative Candidacies This election marks the third time Moore has sought election for Nevadas Legislative office.
In 2012, Moore ran for office as a Democrat. He competed against the incumbent, Jason Frierson and lost in the primary race to the incumbent. His loss was 32.4 percent of the vote to Friersons 67.6. In 2014 Moore sought the office once again, this time, he ran as a Republican. His opponent was incumbent Democrat, Frierson. Moore barely won his bid in the general election. He won with a 40 vote lead; he garnered 50.2 percent versus the incumbents 49.8. Interestingly, he never officially changed parties. After winning the election, as a Republican, he was still listed as a Democrat with the Secretary of State. As a Libertarian in the 2016 race, he is the Republican incumbent. AD8 has three men seeking to serve Nevadans in Carson City. The assemblymans opponents are Republican Norm Ross and Democrat Jason Frierson. The assemblyman in the only minor-party incumbent on the November ballot. When he changed his party in January 2016, his explanation was that he locked horns with many of his Republican counterparts. He further explained his party affiliation move to Libertarian as his desire to be an in-the-middle candidate and to avoid pandering to any individual party, according to Las Vegas Review-Journal.
John Moores History During the 2015 Legislative Session As with any Republican, Moore ran on the promise of no new taxes for Nevada. Unfortunately, for the Republican-held Assembly, the states Governor, Brain Sandoval (R) and lobbyists had a different agenda.
Due to his health problems, Moore missed several crucial votes. In fact, the Conservative Scorecard indicates that during the general session in 2015 he cast two votes and missed eight  or 20 percent. However, when he managed to be present and cast his ballot, his choices did not support the GOP party-line. His two votes were on the following pro-conservation bills.
There was a special session in December 2015. Moore voted his consent to give a foreign corporation a tax break. An electric car manufacturer called Faraday Future received $335 million in incentives to bring the Chinese-backed American start-up company specializing in technology to Nevada.
In a special session during October 2016, Moore cast a yes vote on the Stadium bill. While constituents opinions are split about the stadium being built in Las Vegas, Republicans typically do not vote to increase taxes.
Norm Ross, one of his 2016 opponents, states that Moore supports open borders, as evident with his vote to give money to a foreign-owned company. Furthermore, the incumbent assemblyman calls himself a conservative Libertarian, which is essentially an oxymoron.
John L. Smith chastised the assemblymans past. He pointed out that the assemblyman-elect appeared to be a sharp dresser who looks as though he could succeed in Carson City. Whereas, he looked less sure of himself in the wanted poster issued by the Las Vegas City Marshals Office. Smith pointed out that the fine was $792, and it was almost the same amount he spent on his campaign; $800.
Moore has been called a lawmaker and a lawbreaker. He appears to change parties on a whim, but there may be underlying reasons or deals that encourage his allegiance discrepancies. Perhaps he merely wants to win no matter the consequences. The question remains: Who is John Moore and which ideology does he truly believe?

This was decided because there was the overall thought that real-time voting information, on Election Day, could sway those who had not yet cast their votes. However, that silence will be broken for the 2016 presidential election.
VoteCastr will be providing real-time voting data from eight battleground states. This information is being collected using the same techniques as the presidential campaigns.
At 3:48 p.m. ET, the voting data was given as follows: Over 83 percent of the expected voters have cast their ballots in Florida. Thus far, Hillary Clinton has 48 percent and Donald Trump has 45 percent of the state.
In Colorado, 80 percent of the votes have been counted. Currently, Clinton holds a three-point lead over her Republican opponent.
More than 66 percent of the registered voters have cast their ballots in Iowa. At this time, Trump has a narrow lead of 1 percent.
Wisconsin has turned in 62 percent of their votes. Clinton leads with 48 percent of the votes. Trump trails with 43 percent.
In Nevada, almost 69 percent of registered voters have cast their ballots. Clinton currently leads by a narrow 1 percent.
Clinton holds a 1 percent lead in Ohio. So far, 74 percent of voters have made their choice.
Over 63 percent of the votes have been collected in Pennsylvania. Trump is trailing Clinton by 3 percent.
The VoteCastr model is showing Clinton in place to win these eight battleground states. However, there is an expected surge of votes for Trump, later today. Nevertheless, if Clinton maintains her three-point lead in Florida, her victory will be solidified.
In order for Trump to take the 2016 presidential election, he would have to gain electoral votes from all the states in this report. In the last hour, Trump has not only tightened the gap in Ohio and Iowa, he has a one-point lead. Clinton leads in the remainder of these battleground states, however, her lead has narrowed from 4 to 3 percent.
Guardian Liberty Voice will continue to provide updates throughout the election.

The oval sticker that never came for many voters bears an American flag.
Woburn resident Elisabeth Sweeny, who was rejected, stated that she did not get one. Sweeny also said that she was a little bit excited because it is entertaining to post the sticker on social media. She also declared that to wear it shows people that it is important to vote and that she was also extremely disappointed that she did not receive one.
Daniel Stiffler who answered the phones at the city clerks office said that due to budget cuts the local government of Woburn decided not to give voters the stickers. Stiffler also stated that because the state government does not supply the stickers for the cities and towns when the local budget is cut.
Elections Division spokesman, Brian McNiff, said it is the responsibility of the individual city and town to stock up on the stickers for election day. However, it is not an obligation to pass out an emblematic tag to any voter who passes through the door.

By: Cliff Kincaid | Accuracy in Media 
Instead of underwriting media stars who fail to predict the future, perhaps the University of Virginia (UVA) ought to get back to teaching students marketable skills so they can obtain good jobs. 
One of the big losers on November 8 was UVA media star and Professor Larry Sabato, who said on MSNBCs Lawrence ODonnell show that Our prediction is that Hillary Clinton will get 322 electoral votes, and Donald Trump will get 216. 
Trump/Pence are projected to get 306 electoral votes to Clinton/Kaines 232. 
Perhaps he should take up astrology. 
His Crystal Ball newsletter has been a leader in accurately predicting elections since its inception, says Sabatos website. Described as authoritative, the newsletter is part of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. 
His total compensation in 2014 was $380,000. 
On the November 7 ODonnell show, Sabato predicted Clinton would win North Carolina (Trump won it) and that Clinton had a real shot of winning Ohio (Trump won it by nine points). 
Sabato said, One of my great people at the Crystal Ball, Kyle Condik, wrote a book called Bellwether about Ohio＃so his contacts are the best and they keep telling us that its much, much closer than people realize and that Clinton might, might be able to pull out a victory there＃ 
Kondik is managing editor of Sabatos Crystal Ball newsletter. 
Sabato also predicted a net gain of four for Democrats in the Senate, resulting in a 50-50 tie in Congress upper chamber. If were right about the presidential contest, that means Vice President Tim Kaine (D) will be breaking ties after Inauguration, Sabato claimed. 
Sabato thought there was a chance of Democrats taking the Senate. If were off on the total number of seat changes [in the Senate], he said, we think its slightly likelier that Democrats get to 51 or 52 than Republicans. That could mean the Democrats pulling out a win in Indiana, Missouri, or North Carolina. If Republicans hold on to the majority, it probably would be because Ayotte survives in New Hampshire. 
In fact, Ayotte lost in New Hampshire and Republicans won in Indiana, Missouri, and North Carolina. 
Ayotte alienated Republicans by abandoning Trump. Her campaign alienated conservatives by passing out free condoms to get votes at the University of New Hampshire. 
Rather than being losses, the GOP victories were: In Indiana, the Republican Todd Young beat Democrat Evan Bayh by 52.1 to 42.4. In Missouri, the Republican Roy Blunt beat the Democrat Jason Kander by 49.4 to 46.2. In North Carolina, the Republican Richard Burr beat the Democrat Deborah Ross by 51.1 to 45.3. 
After the Trump victory, Sabatos UVA website declared , We heard for months from many of you, saying that we were underestimating the size of a potential hidden Trump vote and his ability to win. We didnt believe it, and we were wrong. The Crystal Ball is shattered. Well pick up the pieces starting next week as we try to unpack what happened in this election, where there was so much dramatic change from just four years ago. 
He added, We have a lot to learn, and we must make sure the Crystal Ball never has another year like this. This team expects more of itself, and we apologize to our readers for our errors. 
Perhaps Sabato ought to spend more time teaching classes and less time on MSNBC, CNN and other channels. 
To make matters worse, ODonnell brought on Ana Marie Cox, a rabid feminist now with MTV, who breathed a sigh of relief at Sabatos prediction that Trump wouldnt win. But she said America still had a lot to fear because Trumps success in the primaries had revealed some real ugly things about the U.S. 
She added, I am hopeful this is going to be a fairly resounding victory and that is going to put some shame back in people about the kinds of things that have come up during this election. 
Former Jeb Bush communications director Tim Miller was then brought on to say that he was hopeful that Hispanic immigrants would be the ones to put the nail in Donald Trump`s coffin in states like Colorado, Nevada and Florida. 
Trump lost in Nevada by only 2 points and Colorado by only about 3 points. Trump beat Clinton in Florida. 
Sabato told ODonnell that a firm called Latino Decisions had estimated that Clinton would get a higher percentage of Latino votes than Barack Obama, and that Trump was at only 16 percent. 
The results were much different. In fact, the Pew Research Center says Clinton had a lower percentage of Latinos than Obama, and Trump got 29 percent, two more points that Mitt Romney in 2012. 
My crystal ball says Sabato will not change the name of his newsletter and that he will be back in four years making another round of predictions. 
ODonnell himself bought into the hype, declaring that the fear is that the presidency will be handed over to ignorance, incompetence and bigotry, but that the latest polls indicate that＃America should have nothing to fear. 
He added, Donald Trump has taken this country to the brink, and tomorrow voters are likely to take it back. 
This episode of the ODonnell show demonstrates how the media talk among themselves, using sources that reaffirm their biases, while ignoring objective reality. 
We have come to expect this from MSNBC, but to have a prestigious university like UVA participate in such a charade is an absolute disgrace. 
The glass ceiling did not break Tuesday night, but the Crystal Ball shattered, wrote Andrew Cain of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, in a story about Sabatos humiliation. 
But dont think that Sabato will slink away in disgrace. He was back on CNN on Monday giving his opinion on the Electoral College.  ",english,2016-11-17T12:43:28.718+02:00,gulagbound.com,US,,MSNBCs Election Day Crystal Ball is Broken,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Accuracy in Media 
Before Election Day, the liberal media were speculating about the demise of the Republican Party. However, the media misjudged the electorate before November 8 and they are misjudging it again. Its the Democratic Party that faces an uncertain future. 
In an MSNBC broadcast before Election Day, MTVs Ana Marie Cox said the results might just mean that the GOP would cease to be a national party because the demographic trends were in favor of Democrats, and the Democrats had reclaimed the mantle of patriotism and reclaimed the mantle of faith. 
Host Lawrence ODonnell agreed, asking, Are you looking for in tomorrow nights results ＃the beginning of the discussion within the Republican Party about how to rebuild itself into something resembling a coherent party? Former Jeb Bush communications director and political strategist Tim Miller said, I have a lot of pessimism about where the party goes. 
After the results came in, left-wing journalist John Nichols became despondent, writing in his most recent column that The Democratic Party had not lost a presidential race in Wisconsin since 1984. But it did in 2016. The Democratic Party had not lost a Wisconsin U.S. Senate race in a presidential election year since 1980. But it did in 2016. 
But it gets worse. The Democratic Party has been decimated in the state Legislature, he writes from Wisconsin, with a Senate caucus that looks likely to have 13 seats (the smallest total since Richard Nixon was president) and an Assembly caucus with 35 members (the smallest total since Dwight Eisenhower was president). 
In Wisconsin, as noted by Wisconsin Public Radio, Republican Governor Scott Walker will have his biggest GOP majorities yet when lawmakers return to Madison next year. 
Nichols, who writes for The Capital Times, says the Democratic Party of Wisconsin is going to need to rethink and remake itself, but that this is not just a Wisconsin problem. This is a national crisis. His solution is to elect a radical Muslim, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. 
Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy rightly notes , One would think that the last thing Democrats want to publicize after their wholesale repudiation by American voters is their partys ties to radical leftists and Islamic supremacists. Yet, he goes on, that will be the predictable effect of Ellison leading the Democratic National Committee. 
Nichols is not alone in recommending Ellison as DNC chair. Ellison is backed by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). 
Going further left, in this case embracing a fiery critic of Israel, is starting to attract some media scrutiny. The embrace of Ellison could be interpreted as a death wish by the Democratic Party. 
The political situation has changed dramatically. Five years ago Nichols was telling the Democratic Socialists of America that the progressive movement was on the move, and that this process of revolutionary change would continue. So what happened? Simply put, the Democratic Party abandoned the working class, once considered the cornerstone of the Marxist revolution. 
Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing , calls it The Blue Collar Election. He says, A week has passed since election night, and if it wasnt clear then, it is now: Economic pain in the industrial states is real and has shocked our politics. 
In order for the Republican Party to take advantage of this dramatic shift, President-elect Donald Trump has to get tough with foreign countries. Kevin L. Kearns, president of the U.S. Business & Industry Council, says that Trump will face a lot of opposition as he pursues a balanced trade agenda. His antagonists include Wall Street institutions, multinational corporations, major business organizations, academic economists, editorial boards, business journalists, opinion writers, bloggers, and the generally knowledge-free mainstream media, Kearns writes . 
His remark about a knowledge-free mainstream media is right on target. But as we have seen in coverage of the campaign and their predictions about the results, a lack of knowledge hasnt stopped the media from claiming to be knowledgeable. 
The media may sound stupid, but they must realize that if the Republicans are able to accommodate the interests of their new Blue Collar constituency and bring forth a balanced trade and pro-growth agenda, the Democrats will be left with a constituency consisting of a few Muslims, some gays and transgenders, student debt-laden young people, and the radical pro-abortion feminist lobby. Its difficult to see how the Democrats can assemble a majority out of that. Cliff Kincaid

By: Renee Nal | New Zeal Screenshot from ABC News Report (red commentary added) 
One of the many lies stemming from the mainstream media in the wake of Donald Trumps election is that hate crimes have increased. The source of this ridiculous whopper is the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), whose embarrassingly biased reports from partisan hacks are reflective of the mainstream news outlets that cite the group as a legitimate source. 
Any reasonable journalist can take the most cursory of glances at the silly report to see at best, that it is not a valid source. The hateful intimidation and harassment cited by the SPLC are, of course, not listed and therefore cannot be subject to scrutiny. This information, according to SPLC , was collected through news reports, social media, and direct submissions via SPLCs #ReportHate page and is largely anecdotal. 
The phrase largely anecdotal should be a clue for mainstream media sources reporting about the so-called spike in hate crimes. 
Watch this report, which is based on the fake report from the SPLC: 
The New York Times , who recently pledged to be more honest or something, reported that attacks against American Muslims surged last year citing the FBI (which leads to a broken link at the time of this writing) and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which immediately makes their entire article suspect: 
Since the election, hate crime monitors like the Southern Poverty Law Center have reported a rash of verbal or physical abuse targeting minorities and others at schools, mosques and elsewhere. 
There is no evidence. There is no due process. There are no convictions. Yet the mainstream media has been parroting the lie that hate crimes have increased since Donald Trumps election. 
Mainstream journalists have resources. They have money, they have numerous researchers and they have a massive platform. Yet, these same organizations do not bother to use their vast resources to inform Americans of the truth about the SPLCs fake report. This is why they have lost the trust of the American people. 
Last year, the SPLC had an  operating budget  of over $35 million dollars. They have an endowment fund of over $300 million dollars.

Will years of alleged fraud at the CDC get more attention in the Trump administration? 7 reasons CDC employees should be crying in the hallways PORTLAND, Oregon?〞? Question : The day after Donald Trumps unexpected win in the presidential election last week, how many government agencies had reports in the media of their employees crying in the hallways? Answer : Exactly one. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which is based in Atlanta, GA. As a long-time critic of the CDC, I was pretty shocked to see this headline last week, courtesy of Atlantas NPR radio station, 90.1 WABE: Atlanta CDC Employees Express Anxiety Over Trumps Win The story detailed the climate at CDC the day after the election: 
At the General Muir deli across the street from the CDC, a few employees talked to WABE, asking that their names not be used. One microbiologist said her colleagues were crying in the hallways. Its really sad, she said. Its depressing. Im eating a bagel to try and be happy. 
See: http://news.wabe.org/post/atlanta-cdc-employees-express-anxiety-over-trumps-win 
The average voter?〞?even a Trump supporter?〞?probably has no idea why CDC employees might be crying in the hallways, while the average autism parent (meaning those of us who have children with autism) like me understands it perfectly. Frankly, its pretty hard for me to write about the CDC without shaking with at least a little bit of rage. On the off chance this is your first time considering this topic, Ill steady my hands and explain it to you: Source: learntherisk.org The CDC is in charge of recommending the vaccination schedule for U.S. children, which has grown from 5 total doses in the 1960s to more than 70 today. The CDC is ALSO in charge of monitoring vaccine safety for those more than 70 doses. In an ironic twist (at least for parents like me), the CDC is ALSO in charge of tracking the number of children with Autism in the U.S., a number that has grown from 1 in 10,000 in the 1980s to 1 in 68 today. For many autism parents, the CDC being in charge of both implementing the vaccine schedule and monitoring the safety of vaccines has always felt like an extreme conflict of interest. And, we were never alone in that feeling. 10 years ago, two members of Congress, Representatives Dave Weldon and Carolyn Maloney, tried to pass a bill to separate vaccine safety from the CDC: 
From the press release for the bill: Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney 
At a press conference Wednesday morning, U.S. Reps. Dave Weldon, M.D. (R-FL) and Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced a bill that would give responsibility for the nations vaccine safety to an independent agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, removing most vaccine safety research from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Currently, the CDC has responsibility for both vaccine safety and promotion, which is an inherent conflict of interest increasingly garnering public criticism. Congressman Dave Weldon, M.D. Theres an enormous inherent conflict of interest within the CDC and if we fail to move vaccine safety to a separate independent office, safety issues will remain a low priority and public confidence in vaccines will continue to erode, said Weldon, noting that across the federal government similar conflicts of interests have been remedied, but with regard to mandatory childhood vaccines the conflict continues to persist unchecked. This bill will provide the independence necessary to ensure that vaccine safety research is robust, unbiased, and broadly accepted by the public at large. Vaccines do wonders for public health, but when the government requires them, it must also ensure that theyre safe, said Maloney. We need adequate, unbiased research on vaccines, and this legislation would deliver that. I applaud Dr. Weldon for his tremendous commitment to and leadership on this issue. He is truly dedicated to protecting our children and the public at large. See: https://maloney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/weldon-maloney-introduce-vaccine-safety-bill Alas, like every bill intended to reduce the power and influence of the CDC, the bill never passed. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a well-known environmental activist and progeny of one of the most famous political families in the world, has spoken with force about the conflict problems at CDC: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. The CDC is a captive agency. The vaccine agency has become a subsidiary of big pharma. Vaccines are a $30 billion industry, an increasing profit center. They have been able to compromise all checks and balances that once protected children.  Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. For parents uncertain as to where CDCs loyalties lie, the departure of the previous head of CDC?〞?Julie Gerberding?〞?to a well-paying job as President of the vaccine division of Merck , the largest vaccine maker in the world, made many of us permanently cynical: Dr. Julie Gerberding, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was named president of Merck & Co Incs vaccine division, the company said on Monday. Gerberding, who led the CDC from 2002 to 2009, stepped down when President Barack Obama took office. 
See: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-gerberding-idUSTRE5BK2K520091221 7 Reasons Back to the employees crying in the hallways and eating bagels to feel better. In my opinion, its going to get far worse before it gets better for the CDC, and heres 7 reasons why: Reason #1: The CDC just got outed last month by its own scientists complaining that CDCs mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and rogue interests. From the Huffington Post on October 17, 2016: Concerns about the inner workings of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been mounting in recent months amid disclosures of cozy corporate alliances. Now a group of more than a dozen senior scientists have reportedly lodged an ethics complaint alleging the federal agency is being influenced by corporate and political interests in ways that short-change taxpayers＃ It appears that our mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and rogue interests＃ and Congressional intent for our agency is being circumvented by some of our leaders. What concerns us most, is that it is becoming the norm and not the rare exception, the letter states. These questionable and unethical practices threaten to undermine our credibility and reputation as a trusted leader in public health. See: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carey-gillam/spider-bites-cdc-ethics-c_b_12525012.html The scientists?〞?who chose to remain anonymous for fear of retribution (never a good reflection on an agencys culture)?〞?published a complete letter with their complaints that you can read here : We are often directed to do things we know are not right. 〞 CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics in Research (CDC SPIDER) Reason #2: CDC has a whistleblower scientist〞 Dr. William Thompson?〞?alleging that CDC scientists destroyed data that showed a link between the MMR vaccine and autism This is a serious allegation, especially because Dr. Thompson is the principal author of a number of the studies used to prove vaccines dont cause autism released by CDC. From former CBS journalist Sharyl Attkisson: A current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) senior scientist has made an unprecedented admission: he and his colleagueshe says committed scientific misconduct to cover up a meaningful link between vaccines and autism in black boys. Just as startling, the CDC scientist, Dr. William Thompson, says the study co-authors scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to the study. The remaining four co-authors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting room, and reviewed and went through all the hardcopy documents that we had thought we should discard, and put them into a huge garbage can. The＃co-authors＃brought a big garbage can into the meeting room＃ [and put the documents]＃into a huge garbage can.  CDC Senior Scientist Dr. William Thompson 
See: https://sharylattkisson.com/cdc-scientist-we-scheduled-meeting-to-destroy-vaccine-autism-study-documents/ A huge garbage can? Did he really say that? Yes, he really did, and one of our Congressmen?〞?Representative Bill Posey of Florida?〞?repeated Dr. Thompsons words in Congressional testimony: Reason #3: CDC has another whistleblower alleging that CDCs gathering of autism prevalence numbers has been fraudulent From the The Alliance for Human Research Protection website: On April 4, 2016, Dr. Judith Pinborough-Zimmerman, the former Principal Investigator for the CDCs Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network (ADDM) in Utah, filed a whistleblower lawsuit in the U.S. District Court. Dr. Zimmerman charged University of Utah researchers for CDCs Network with publishing data under peoples names who had not done the work and that the data contained uncorrected errors. Depositions from Zimmerman and her former colleagues suggest that the alleged data errors were serious and have the potential to produce major differences in reported Utah autism rates. In the 2008 ADDM Network Report, Utah autism rates were the highest in the country at 1 in 47. In the 2012 report released today, Utah rates plummeted nearly 20% to 1 in 58 as most other ADDM Network sites reported either rising or stable autism rates. See: http://ahrp.org/lawsuit-by-principal-investigator-for-cdc-utah-autism-data-filed-whistleblower-lawsuit/ Health Choice, an advocacy organization, explains why Ms. Zimmermans allegations are so serious: The CDC has been misrepresenting the alarming rise in autism rates since the late 1980s, says Health Choice Executive Leadership Team Chairman Mark Blaxill. His Health Choice analysis, The Autism Emergency Continues, released today outlines a number of criticisms of the CDCs surveillance program. They have selected a partial and unrepresentative sample of states to track, changed the sample in a biased fashion over the years, and then take too long to report out the data. Todays 2012 report is over a decade behind the problem, giving us autism rates for children born twelve years ago. If the sharp increases in autism rates began in the late 1980s, asks Blaxill, why would CDC design a tracking survey beginning with the 1992 birth year? Elsewhere, theyve published data with very low rates from the late 1980s in New Jersey and Georgia but dont connect the dots in the ADDM publications from todays 1 in 68 rate back to these earlier numbers. Health Choice is very worried that the CDCs ADDM Network reporting is not accurately representing the seriousness of the autism epidemic. For most affected individuals, autism is a lifelong disability, a condition that frequently wreaks havoc on families, school systems, and state resources. Mr. Blaxill went on to say, since 1990, autism rates have exploded: something new and terrible is happening to a generation of children. Its time to for the CDC stop sugar coating the inconvenient facts and confess that we have a national emergency so we can finally get to the bottom of this tragic problem. Reason #3A: One of the authors of the Danish Studies exonerating thimerosals (a mercury preservative) role in Autism is wanted by the CDC for embezzlement (Authors note: the failure to mention Poul Thorsen was brought up to me by an attentive reader. Its hard to keep track of so much malfeasance!) Im just glad I can prove this one with other articles, its almost too much to believe: Researcher who dispelled vaccine-autism link: Most-wanted fugitive This is on the HHS website, right now! A former Centers for Disease Control (CDC) researcher, best known for his frequently-cited studies dispelling a link between vaccines and autism, is still considered on the lam after allegedly using CDC grants of tax dollars to buy a house and cars for himself. Most wanted fugitive CDC researcher Poul Thorsen published studies dispelling a link between vaccines and autism Poul Thorsen, listed as a most-wanted fugitive by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, was discredited in April 2011 when he was indicted on 13 counts of wire fraud and nine counts of money laundering. Some have argued that his alleged fraudulent behavior calls into question the validity of his studies. There is no indication the studies have been retracted to date. See: https://sharylattkisson.com/researcher-who-dispelled-vaccine-autism-link-most-wanted-fugitive/ I cant make this stuff up! Heres another article about Poul Thorsen from Robert F. Kennedy, Jr: Central Figure in CDC Vaccine Cover-Up Absconds With $2M 
See: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr/central-figure-in-cdc-vac_b_494303.html Reason #4: Two Merck whistleblowers are alleging that the Mumps vaccine doesnt work very well, and that Merck knew that and fudged the data Remember the former CDC head (Julie Gerberding) who went to go work at the Merck vaccine division? Yup, it really is that ugly＃ See: http://philadelphia.legalexaminer.com/fda-prescription-drugs/massive-fraud-in-merck-mmr-vaccine-testing/ A U.S. judge rejected Mercks attempt at a dismissal after determining there was plausible grounds for the claims. Therefore the medical giant is being forced to defend themselves and their vaccine in at least two federal cases. Merck could also be forced to defend itself in Congress. Representative Bill Posey (R-FL)?〞?a known critic of the CDC whom is investigating the link between autism and vaccines?〞?is reviewing hundreds of documents turned over by the CDC whistleblower. According to the whistleblowers court documents, Mercks misconduct was far-ranging: It failed to disclose that its mumps vaccine was not as effective as Merck represented, (ii) used improper testing techniques, (iii) manipulated testing methodology, (iv) abandoned undesirable test results, (v) falsified test data, (vi) failed to adequately investigate and report the diminished efficacy of its mumps vaccine, (vii) falsely verified that each manufacturing lot of mumps vaccine would be as effective as identified in the labeling, (viii) falsely certified the accuracy of applications filed with the FDA, (ix) falsely certified compliance with the terms of the CDC purchase contract, (x) engaged in the fraud and concealment describe herein for the purpose of illegally monopolizing the U.S. market for mumps vaccine, (xi) mislabeled, misbranded, and falsely certified its mumps vaccine, and (xii) engaged in the other acts described herein to conceal the diminished efficacy of the vaccine the government was purchasing. The fraudulent activities, say the whistleblowers, were designed to produce test results that would meet the FDAs requirement that the mumps vaccine was 95 percent effective. Reason #5: Just yesterday, a local Atlanta TV station explained to the world what the vaccine court is and that its not working Definitive book on the vaccine court. Never heard of the Vaccine Court? Youre not alone. This is the first news story Ive ever seen mentioning and criticizing the court, and its from an Atlanta TV station! From WSB-TV: A federal program designed to help victims suffering from life-altering reactions to vaccines is falling short on promises made when it started. Its called the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a $3.6 billion fund created to take care of victims with catastrophic reactions to vaccines. But a Channel 2 Action News investigation found it also protects vaccine-makers from being subject to lawsuits. And they dont pay for the program?〞?you do. 
See: http://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/investigates/3b-program-to-help-vaccine-victims-falls-short-on-promises/467245775 Reason #6: A published study shows that 83 cases from vaccine court (see above) compensated children with autism for vaccine injury So, let me get this straight: A senior scientist from the CDC who authored many of the studies proving vaccines dont cause autism says they threw away data in a big garbage can that showed a connection between vaccines and autism＃ A group of lawyers then reviewed records from the vaccine court and found children with autism are being compensated by the court for vaccine injury causing their autism＃ ＃Are we sure vaccines cant cause autism?

For over 20 years, the federal government has publicly denied a vaccine-autism link, while at the same time its Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has been awarding damages for vaccine injury to children with brain damage, seizures and autism. A new investigation, based on verifiable government data, breaks ground in the controversial vaccine-autism debate. The investigation found that a substantial number of children compensated for vaccine injury also have autism and that such cases have existed since 1989, the year after the VICP was formed. 
SafeMinds Executive Director, Lyn Redwood, RN, MSN comments, This study dramatically shifts the debate on autism and vaccines. The question is no longer, Can vaccines cause autism? The answer is clear. Now, we have to ask, How many cases of autism have vaccines caused and how do we prevent new injuries from occurring? The government has asserted that it does not track autism among the vaccine-injured. SafeMinds responds that not looking is the easiest way not to find something. SafeMinds is calling for immediate federal research into the mechanisms of injury in these children in an effort to protect other children from harm and Congressional action to reform the VICP. Reason #7: President-Elect Trump appears to know the truth about vaccines and autism, and hes not afraid to say it! Yes, I saved the best for last. If youre an autism parent, you already knew this one. But, Donald Trump has been speaking the truth about what happened to our kids for years. The first I heard of President-elect Trumps understanding of this issue was back in December 2007: TRUMP SPEAKS: I THINK ITS THE VACCINATIONS 
See: http://www.ageofautism.com/2007/12/trump-speaks1.html What if you were a large national autism charity and you held a fundraiser at a billionaires house and the billionaire told reporters he thought autism was caused by vaccines? What if your large national autism charity was wildly dismissive of vaccines as a cause for autism, had scientists on staff who had worked to produce faulty research exonerating vaccines alongside the CDC, and had no research dollars allocated to exploring the vaccine-autism relationship? Well, then you would be Autism Speaks holding a fundraiser at Donald Trumps Palm Beach mansion. As THIS article from the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reports: At a news conference Thursday in a gold-trimmed Mar-A-Lago ballroom, Trumps wife, Melania, noted her 22-month-old son, Baron, and said: I cannot imagine what the mothers [with autistic children] and mothers all around the world go through. ＃ Lets get rid of autism. In an interview, Donald Trump said he thinks the rising prevalence of autism is related to vaccinations of babies and toddlers. One in 150 children is now diagnosed with autism, with the prevalence higher among boys. When I was growing up, autism wasnt really a factor, he [Trump] said. And now all of a sudden, its an epidemic. Everybody has their theory, and my theory is the shots. Theyre getting these massive injections at one time. I think its the vaccinations . As you may know, President-elect Trumps statements have only gotten bolder since then. Or how about his words during this appearance on Fox News? Thank you for your honesty, President-elect Trump. Crying through the hallways at CDC? I think the crying has just begun.

One of the biggest myths being propagated in the compliant mainstream media today is that doctors are either pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, and that the anti-vaccine doctors are all quacks. 
However, nothing could be further from the truth in the vaccine debate. Doctors are not unified at all on their positions regarding the science of vaccines, nor are they unified in the position of removing informed consent to a medical procedure like vaccines. 
The two most extreme positions are those doctors who are 100% against vaccines and do not administer them at all, and those doctors that believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective for ALL people, ALL the time, by force if necessary. 
Very few doctors fall into either of these two extremist positions, and yet it is the extreme pro-vaccine position that is presented by the U.S. Government and mainstream media as being the dominant position of the medical field. 
In between these two extreme views, however, is where the vast majority of doctors practicing today would probably categorize their position. Many doctors who consider themselves pro-vaccine, for example, do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual. 
Many doctors recommend a delayed vaccine schedule for some patients, and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule. Other doctors choose to recommend vaccines based on the actual science and merit of each vaccine, recommending some, while determining that others are not worth the risk for children, such as the suspect seasonal flu shot. 
These doctors who do not hold extreme positions would be opposed to government-mandated vaccinations and the removal of all parental exemptions. 
In this eBook, I am going to summarize the many doctors today who do not take the most extremist pro-vaccine position, which is probably not held by very many doctors at all, in spite of what the pharmaceutical industry, the federal government, and the mainstream media would like the public to believe.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/10/awakened-humanity-awaits-fully-scripted.html No event in American history (if you ask me) has been more engineered, more anticipated and more built up than the upcoming November 8, 2016 presidential election. Face it. This presidential election season made the truth movement mainstream. Evil and corruption was brought into the light. We've observed what a George Soros -like engineered regime breakdown looks and feels like from the inside, our side this time. We had heard and read about all those foreign governments that the US overthrew with their ""democracy"" tactics using ""special forces"", NGO's, paid-for revolutionaries, activists and in some cases flat out murderous fighters ( ISIS , moderate rebels). This time the engineered chaos was happening here in the US.This 2016 election season has been packed with outright exposed corruption, lies, propaganda, murders, stolen primaries, fabricated accusations, distractions, staged debates and much more.We have seen a criminally accused presidential candidate get away with crimes in broad daylight while suspected of suffering from Parkinson's disease, passing out, having seizures and even being followed around by a creepy doctor with a seizure medication injector. This is the stuff Hollywood films are made of. The list of the insanity goes on and on, right? We've witnessed plenty of lies, propaganda and Jerry Springer show-like attacks by the candidates to create just the perfect smokescreen so that Americans are not looking into the events in Aleppo or Mosul much less the Hillary-DNC-mainstream media corruption scandals and revelations.Instead of keeping a close eye on the doings of the US criminal empire, the elite relied on a very in-your-face and increasingly arrogant, defiant and now very busted and discredited mainstream media to push the desired paradigm and reinforce it every which way they can. Actually, this understates the situation. What really happened was that the mainstream media joined forces with the chosen candidate of the ruling oligarchs ( Hillary ) and together their campaign (the DNC-Hillary-Soros-Moveon.org-Michael Moore-Hollywood-mainstream media complex) has brought us to the ending that truth seekers are now looking ahead to with great anxiety and anticipation. Actually, I'm understating the situation again. All or most Americans (awakened or not) are anticipating and anxiously awaiting the end results of the US presidential elections.The question we should all be asking then is, how did we get here? Oh, and perhaps more importantly, where are we going? And to answer this, one must realize that the ruling elite have plans. They have a lot of money and they have players willing to go along with their plans. Not sure of this? Then please research Sandy Hook or Boston bombing events. Or research many of the crisis actor events of the past few years.That's right. While they were staging one event after another, too many Americans were too busy and too afraid to call these fake events for what they were. Too many Americans fell for the trick that we were supposed to believe mainstream media ""stories"" and narratives unless we could ""prove"" that the account didn't happen the way mainstream media said it did. In other words, many Americans were tricked into believing that unless proven otherwise, we should BELIEVE mainstream media. Well here we are in October of 2016 and finally (though it has been common knowledge to many of us for a long while) the illegitimacy of the mainstream media is carved in stone. No longer can it be considered a ""conspiracy"" by anyone, that mainstream media is corrupt and acts as a tool of psychological terrorism against the public on behalf of the ruling elite.That said, now it is time to confront the fully engineered and long planned ending of this 2016 US presidential election. Will staged "" political terrorism "", a term just introduced a couple of weeks ago into the American psyche, be staged as Mike Adams at Natural News is writing about ? Will this ""terrorism"" or planned ""event"" mark the beginning of the end of America? If so, what will happen? How will it all go down? Many are now wondering how deep is this web of corruption and how far will the traitors identified before us be willing to go to destroy America? The one thing everyone should accept is that this ending has been planned just like so many ""events"" of the past several years have been scripted and planned. So today I invite readers to acknowledge this very important singular factor in today's events. The fact that they are planned. The notion of organic and spontaneous results is something the ruling elite hate. They hate anything that is organic, spontaneous, unpredictable, people-powered, natural and real. They need everything to be controlled, scripted, planned, orchestrated, engineered. Do you see a pattern here? One consciousness longs for freedom, naturalness and spontaneity, the other longs to control, orchestrate, engineer and dictate the ending, like a master would want to control his slave.Understanding this fundamental contrast between the control freak consciousness (think ruling elite) and the free spirited consciousness desiring to simply be free, will allow you to see what's coming this November 8th 2016. What's coming is a long awaited day for which the ruling elite have paid a lot of money and hired many people to manipulate and control the ending of. So the real question is, will their operation succeed? Looking at the election day ending from a birds-eye view and seeing how the ruling elite think and operate it is not difficult to see that they too are waiting for that day so that they can implement whatever plan they'll need based on the materializing reality at that moment. In this (what I'll call) wait-and-see plan whose execution of plan will either be entirely controlled from the beginning or be an adjusting reaction-based plan to be determined by the emerging reality, we can be sure that at no point will the ruling elite accept an ending that ruins their plan. In other words they will adjust their plan as often and as desperately as possible and necessary to engineer an ending to their liking.This ultimately is all we need to know to plan our (truth seekers and freedom lovers) next move. And our next move should look something like this if you ask me:1- Have a plan including options for self-sustaining yourself and your loved ones (food, water, shelter and other personal needs)2- Expect corruption but continue fighting and exposing the perpetrators. Let's not let one of these traitors (including crisis actors and operatives working for the state) get away with what they have done.3- Don't rely ONLY on the internet to keep track of developing events. You might want to write down current event information or better yet print out key articles and documents (proof). Also download important videos don't assume these videos will always be available on YouTube or the internet. Remember we are entering a much more volatile and intense information war age. The main point is we need to archive the evidence against those criminals who have betrayed America and humanity.4- Beware of layered psychological operations. Question everything you hear and don't discount that some ""news"" is designed for you to hear it (get it?). Unfortunately the controllers have indeed upped the anti when it comes to the information war. In deceptive times like these grabbing on to the principles you believe in become much more important than agreeing with someone on every little nuance about a particular event. Stay oriented and remember who the bad guys are, especially as we see the Hillary-mainstream media complex laughably blaming Russian president Vladimir Putin for all the now-revealed corruption and criminality of the Clintons, the mainstream media, the DNC and many others.Now is the time to confront the very real and very relevant inherent concepts of truth versus lies, lightness versus darkness, freedom versus slavery and knowledge versus hidden knowledge (the occult) because this, my friends, is what we are dealing with. We (truth seekers) are all in this together. We didn't ask to be put in this show, it sort of came to us. Perhaps we (awakened humanity) are fulfilling a role that we cannot fully understand. This species we call humans needs some members of it's kind to save the rest of the species and if you are reading this then you are probably a chosen vessel in this battle for humanity.There is nothing to fear for the ending has surely been scripted. We (like them) will also respond in real-time in the most effective way possible. What we need to do more than anything else is ... (pay attention) ... think ahead just like they do.And so today I'm thinking ahead. I have plans for both scenarios (Trump or Hillary declared victory). I have plans for no ""political terrorism"" and political terrorism, shock or no shock, chaos or no chaos. In my world the problem remains the same until we hold these corrupt ruling elite, their politicians and players all responsible for their criminality and corruption. Plain and simple, the ruling elite must be identified, stopped and held accountable for their crimes against humanity and the US constitution. This is more important than any presidential election. Will a Trump victory make this accountability more possible? Many are hopeful of this but ultimately we must find a way to impose our will on the future and not rely on a politician to do this for us.Finally, I'm reminded of the very last line of the film ' The American Dream ' when the villain asks ""what do you think this is?"" and the answer ""this is AMERICA!!"". Likewise, let's remember, this IS America, the politically hijacked land that guarantees each and every individual inherent rights which are clearly and indisputably outlined in the US constitution. Will an opportunity present itself for the rule of law to be restored or will the ruling elite have their way? That question will very likely be answered at a time not necessarily coinciding with election night. This is a reminder to all that the battle we face for humanity and truth is continuous and very long term not about one isolated moment or day.

Outwardly we have a Constitutional government. We have operating within our government and political system ＃ a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state.... The important point to remember about this group is not its ideology but its organization＃ It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government.... This group ... is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts. It is practically irremovable.〞 Senator William Jenner, 1954 speech Unaffected by elections. Unaltered by populist movements. Beyond the reach of the law. Say hello to Americas shadow government. A corporatized, militarized, entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are, in essence, running the country, this shadow government represents the hidden face of a government that has no respect for the freedom of its citizenry.No matter which candidate wins the presidential election, this shadow government is here to stay. Indeed, as recent documents by the FBI reveal, this shadow government 〞 also referred to as The 7th Floor Group 〞 may well have played a part in who will win the White House this year.To be precise, however, the future president will actually inherit not one but two shadow governments.The first shadow government, referred to as COG or Continuity of Government, is made up of unelected individuals who have been appointed to run the government in the event of a catastrophe.COG is a phantom menace waiting for the right circumstances 〞 a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, an economic meltdown 〞 to bring it out of the shadows, where it operates even now. When and if COG takes over, the police state will transition to martial law.Yet it is the second shadow government 〞 also referred to as the Deep State 〞 that poses the greater threat to freedom right now. Comprised of unelected government bureaucrats, corporations, contractors, paper-pushers, and button-pushers who are actually calling the shots behind the scenes, this government within a government is the real reason we the people have no real control over our government.The Deep State, which  operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power , makes a mockery of elections and the entire concept of a representative government. So who or what is the Deep State? Its the militarized police, which have joined forces with state and federal law enforcement agencies   themselves as a standing army. Its the fusion centers and spy agencies that have created a surveillance state and turned all of us into suspects. Its the courthouses and prisons that have allowed corporate profits to take precedence over due process and justice. Its the military empire with its private contractors and defense industry that is bankrupting the nation. Its the private sector with its 854,000 contract personnel with top-secret clearances , a number greater than that of top-secret-cleared civilian employees of the government.Its what former congressional staffer Mike Lofgren refers to as  a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies : the Department of Defense, the State Department, Homeland Security, the CIA, the Justice Department, the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President via the National Security Council, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a handful of vital federal trial courts, and members of the defense and intelligence committees.Its every facet of a government that is no longer friendly to freedom and is working overtime to trample the Constitution underfoot and render the citizenry powerless in the face of the governments power grabs, corruption and abusive tactics.These are the key players that drive the shadow government . This is the hidden face of the American police state that will continue long past Election Day.Just consider some of the key programs and policies advanced by the shadow government that will continue no matter who occupies the Oval Office. Domestic surveillance No matter who wins the presidential popularity contest, the National Security Agency (NSA), with its $10.8 billion black ops annual budget, will continue to spy on every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone. Thus, on any given day, whether youre walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the NSA or some other entity, is listening in and tracking your behavior. Local police have been outfitted with a litany of surveillance gear, from license plate readers and cell phone tracking devices to biometric data recorders. Technology now makes it possible for the police to scan passersby in order to detect the contents of their pockets, purses, briefcases, etc. Full-body scanners, which perform virtual strip-searches of Americans traveling by plane, have gone mobile, with roving police vans that peer into vehicles and buildings alike 〞 including homes. Coupled with the nations growing network of real-time surveillance cameras and facial recognition software, soon there really will be nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. Global spying The NSAs massive surveillance network, what the Washington Post refers to as a $500 billion  espionage empire , will continue to span the globe and target every single person on the planet who uses a phone or a computer. The NSAs Echelon program intercepts and analyzes virtually every phone call, fax and email message sent anywhere in the world. In addition to carrying out domestic surveillance on peaceful political groups such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace and several religious groups, Echelon has also been a keystone in the governments attempts at political and corporate espionage . Roving TSA searches The American taxpayer will continue to get ripped off by government agencies in the dubious name of national security. One of the greatest culprits when it comes to swindling taxpayers has been the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), with its questionable deployment of and complete mismanagement of millions of dollars worth of airport full-body X-ray scanners, punitive patdowns by TSA agents and thefts of travelers valuables. Considered essential to national security, TSA programs will continue in airports and at transportation hubs around the country. USA Patriot Act, NDAA Americas so-called war on terror, which it has relentlessly pursued since 9/11, will continue to chip away at our freedoms, unravel our Constitution and transform our nation into a battlefield, thanks in large part to such subversive legislation as the USA Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act. These laws completely circumvent the rule of law and the rights of American citizens. In so doing, they re-orient our legal landscape in such a way as to ensure that martial law, rather than the U.S. Constitution, is the map by which we navigate life in the United States. These laws will continue to be enforced no matter who gets elected. Militarized police state Thanks to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local law enforcement agencies without charge, police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers into heavily armed extensions of the military, complete with jackboots, helmets, shields, batons, pepper-spray, stun guns, assault rifles, body armor, miniature tanks and weaponized drones. Having been given the green light to probe, poke, pinch, taser, search, seize, strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance, all with the general blessing of the courts, Americas law enforcement officials, no longer mere servants of the people entrusted with keeping the peace, will continue to keep the masses corralled, controlled, and treated like suspects and enemies rather than citizens. SWAT team raids With more than 80,000 SWAT team raids carried out every year on unsuspecting Americans by local police for relatively routine police matters and federal agencies laying claim to their own law enforcement divisions, the incidence of botched raids and related casualties will continue to rise. Nationwide, SWAT teams will continue to be employed to address an astonishingly trivial array of criminal activity or mere community nuisances including angry dogs, domestic disputes, improper paperwork filed by an orchid farmer, and misdemeanor marijuana possession. Domestic drones The domestic use of drones will continue unabated. As mandated by Congress, there will be 30,000 drones crisscrossing the skies of America by 2020, all part of an industry that could be worth as much as $30 billion per year. These machines, which will be equipped with weapons, will be able to record all activities, using video feeds, heat sensors and radar. An Inspector General report revealed that the Dept. of Justice has already spent nearly $4 million on drones domestically, largely for use by the FBI , with grants for another $1.26 million so police departments and nonprofits can acquire their own drones. School-to-prison pipeline The paradigm of abject compliance to the state will continue to be taught by example in the schools, through school lockdowns where police and drug-sniffing dogs enter the classroom, and zero tolerance policies that punish all offenses equally and result in young people being expelled for childish behavior. School districts will continue to team up with law enforcement to create a schoolhouse to jailhouse track by imposing a double dose of punishment: suspension or expulsion from school, accompanied by an arrest by the police and a trip to juvenile court. Overcriminalization The government bureaucracy will continue to churn out laws, statutes, codes and regulations that reinforce its powers and value systems and those of the police state and its corporate allies, rendering the rest of us petty criminals. The average American now unknowingly commits three felonies a day, thanks to this overabundance of vague laws that render otherwise innocent activity illegal. Consequently, small farmers who dare to make unpasteurized goat cheese and share it with members of their community will continue to have their farms raided. Privatized Prisons States will continue to outsource prisons to private corporations , resulting in a cash cow whereby mega-corporations imprison Americans in private prisons in order to make a profit.In exchange for corporations buying and managing public prisons across the country at a supposed savings to the states, the states have to agree to maintain a 90% occupancy rate in the privately run prisons for at least 20 years. The Private Prisons Conspiracy: A Secret Meeting That Changed Rap Music Forever Endless wars Americas expanding military empire will continue to bleed the country dry at a rate of more than $15 billion a month (or $20 million an hour).The Pentagon spends more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health, education, welfare, and safety.Yet what most Americans fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with enriching the military industrial complex at taxpayer expense. Read: USA Has Killed More Than 20 Million People in 37 'Victim Nations' Since World War II Are you getting the message yet? The next president, much like the current president and his predecessors, will be little more than a figurehead, a puppet to entertain and distract the populace from whats really going on.As Lofgren reveals, this state within a state,  concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue , is a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out, connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state whose leaders we choose.The Deep State not only holds the nations capital in thrall, but it also controls Wall Street (which supplies the cash that keeps the political machine quiescent and operating as a diversionary marionette theater) and Silicon Valley.This is fascism in its most covert form, hiding behind public agencies and private companies to carry out its dirty deeds.It is a marriage between government bureaucrats and corporate fat cats.As Lofgren concludes: ""[T]he Deep State is so heavily entrenched, so well protected by surveillance, firepower, money and its ability to co-opt resistance that it is almost impervious to change＃ ""If there is anything the Deep State requires it is silent, uninterrupted cash flow and the confidence that things will go on as they have in the past. It is even willing to tolerate a degree of gridlock: Partisan mud wrestling over cultural issues may be a useful distraction from its agenda."" In other words, as I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , as long as government officials 〞 elected and unelected alike 〞 are allowed to operate beyond the reach of the Constitution, the courts and the citizenry, the threat to our freedoms remains undiminished.So the next time you find yourselves despondent over the 2016 presidential candidates, remember that its just a puppet show intended to distract you from the silent coup being carried out by America's shadow government.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/russell-brand-brilliantly-explains.html The mixed reactions over the election results is certainly no secret. Some are terrified and devastated, others are joyous, feeling hopeful and are starting to think the elite lost some control on this one. Russell Brand had some rather interesting insight that resonated deeply with me as its precisely what Ive been sharing since the night of the election: dont lose hope. More on that below, but first please read this important perspective. The fact Trump ＆got in shows that, more than anything, people really want change. They are tired of the same old stuff, and enough was brought to the surface about how corrupt Hillary is that people wanted to try something different.During the tail end of election night, as social media lit up, I remember feeling that the election result and the Brexit result brought forth very similar reactions. Many did what the media told them to do and simply began calling out ＆the stupid people, racist people and uneducated people! But the truth is, we wont see the world clearly with that worldview, were being challenged to expand our consciousness here and I for one believe that is our course of action. Bernie Blues All in hindsight! Although Bernie had the popular vote before, Hillary, the DNC and the media worked to knock him out. Now more than ever everyone wants Bernie back, and while people think its a mistake that he didnt get in, its not. Its perfect. because thats what it took to get people to realize the system is rigged . You see, you cant pick and choose when to say that ＆everything happens for a reason and that ＆everything is perfect and ＆consciousness creates reality etc. Those are universal truths that remain true regardless of what is taking place. When something doesnt go our way we fall out of awareness and into ego. We begin burying ourselves in emotion. It would be better, instead, to accept what happened and begin asking why? And how? What can we learn from this and why did we co-create this reality? Think about it, what is more important given our incredibly messed up situation? Having another president we feel OK about or now having the world know that the elections are rigged? There is a corrupt elite running our world and that now sets the stage for discussion on where we can go from here. It is imperative that we come to terms with and understand our current state without turning a blind eye to whats really going on. If we dont do that, we wont be able to come up with solutions that truly work. Shifting consciousness includes seeing things clearly and learning the lesson this cycle is trying to teach us. (...) What Now? So where do we go from here? Whats next? Well, the first step is to process the emotions and the fear thats getting in the way of us seeing the truth. If we keep getting caught up in them, were only going to create even more problems 〞 which is our choice. But ask yourself if you feel its necessary to do this given that a quick shift in awareness can help us see more clearly and help us begin a different set of discussions. The next step would be having the conversation about the elephant in the room: its troubling that after all these years, we still show up at the polling stations to vote for a system that doesnt have the peoples interests in mind and that is only making things worse as each year goes by. With a shift in consciousness and awareness, we can start creating something new .

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/biggest-winners-and-losers-of-2016-us.html The biggest collective losers of the campaign were the mainstream media. Some of course were worse than others, but all of the old fashioned mainstream outlets were terrible. They operated on a basis of contempt for the honest concerns of ordinary people.They hid Hillary Clintons scandals from public view as though oblivious to the fact that in the internet age, the truth cannot be hidden nor suppressed by the failing media-industrial complex.Long before Donald Trump declared his candidacy, the systematic problems of mainstream media in the west were well known.The total deceit with which they cover international affairs, slandering countries which do not actively pursue neoliberal policies, was in full view. Their job is to report the facts and collect information. Instead they have acted like mad agitators for their pet geopolitical projects.As the mainstream media begins to collapse, so too are common misconceptions about war and peace. In 2003 when mainstream media still had a fairly stern grip on public consciousness, many were duped into believing Bush and Blairs lies about Iraq. Thanks to new media, people in the west have a far better understanding of the realities in the Middle East than they did thirteen years ago. It explains why popular support for war in Syria and by extrapolation on Russia, something that the likes of Hillary Clinton have wildly campaigned for, remains deeply unpopular with ordinary people. The Biggest Winner After Donald Trump , the biggest winners were Julian Assange and Wikileaks . Wikileaks did what honest journalists ought to do, they publish information that is vital to the public interest without having a hidden agenda. Assange expressed his personal disdain for both Trump and Clinton and recently explained the scientific reasons why Wikileaks released damning information on Clinton and not Trump. In all he said he was fair minded and open minded.This remained the case despite Hillary and her supporters making death threats to Assange and Assange having his internet connection at the Ecuadorian Embassy in which he remains captive, cut off after the US State Department put pressure on the Government of Ecuador. But Assange persisted and leak after leak showed American voters and the wider world who Hillary Clinton actually is. It is a very different image from the sugar coated picture painted by the mainstream media. [Her allegiance to the Rothschilds and NWO master manipulator George Soros has also been confirmed , as well as her strong ties to Monsanto .]Wikileaks exposed how Hillary says one thing in public and other to her friends in Wall Street. Wikileaks exposed lie after lie, cover-up after cover-up. Julian Assanges place in history as someone who has exposed the lies of politicians like Hillary Clinton is now assured. He is owed a debt of gratitude by all those who value truth and justice. By Adam Garrie (excerpt) Dear Friends, HumansAreFree is and will always be free to access and use.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/actually-nobody-won-2016-presidential.html Nobody for President, thats my campaign slogan, Nick Cannon asserted in  Too Broke to Vote , his viral criticism of the American electoral process from March of this year. Now, it turns out nobody for president won the 2016 election in a landslide.According to new voter turnout statistics from the 2016 election, 47 percent of Americans voted for nobody, far outweighing the votes cast for Trump (25.5 percent) and Hillary (25.6 percent) by eligible voters.And the I voted for nobody group is actually much larger than the 47 percent reported because that number only includes eligible voters.How many millions of Americans under the legal voting age 〞 not to mention the countless millions who have lost their voting rights 〞 voted for nobody, as well? Factoring in those individuals, around 193 million people did not vote for Trump or Clinton. Thats nearly two-thirds of the population of the United States.Nobody also seemingly won the presidential primaries, with only 9 percent of Americans casting their votes for either Trump or Clinton. So when does nobody take office? Nobody won the majority of votes in the primaries or the general election, and the two main candidates who were running didnt win the popular vote 〞 they simply slightly outcompeted each other considering neither garnered over 50 percent of the eligible voters ballots.Thats where the real debate begins.As I wrote back in August when the primary voter turnout rates came in, one could argue that Trump (and Obama ) do not have a legitimate mandate to rule over the people of the United States. Trump did not win the majority of Americans votes 〞 not even close. When all Americans are included, Trump only garnered the votes of about 19 percent of us. This means the United States will be ruled over by a small minority of voters who elected someone to continually impose their political positions on the other 81 percent of us. Ron Paul: ' US Elections Are Rigged & Voting is Used to Pacify the Public ' Of course, as is the case with Democrats looking to assign blame for Hillarys loss, pundits and political pontificators argue the people who didnt vote have no right to complain about the outcome. After all, a non-vote or a vote for a third-party candidate was, in actuality, a vote for Trump. But that logic is flawed. The majority of Americans dont vote anymore because the political system no longer represents them . Weve been disenfranchised by decades of corrupt, unrepresentative politicians.The United States, according to a highly-cited academic study, is effectively an oligarchy elected by a minority of voters ruled by a smaller minority of disliked politicians who represent an even smaller minority of billionaires and special interests. You know it, I know it, hell, even former U.S. President Jimmy Carter knows it . The majority of Americans voted for nobody not because they dont care or because they are apathetic 〞 they voted no confidence in a political system that forgot about them a long time ago.

The Republicans fear of voter fraud may yet come true 〞 mostly because it looks like the Republicans are going to be the ones instigating it, thanks to Donald Trump, who basically told his followers on Sunday to go out and steal the election. Four or five times 
Theres been a lot of digital ink spilled this election on the delusional claims of voter fraud, but what I think is interesting is that this highlights just how ready the right-wing is to divorce itself from the electoral process entirely . Theyve lost the popular vote five of the last six elections, and if things go the way theyre going and American liberals get out to vote, its going to be six of the last seven on the morning of November 9. 
Trump and the Republican Party would like their followers to believe that this isnt because their ideology is painfully out of step with the country in modern times. Instead, Trump claims the election will be stolen from him  whether by Mexicans, or the media, or a cabal of international bankers. 
But see, heres the thing: there is a self-proclaimed billionaire whos working to undermine the election, and its not Carlos Slim 〞 its Donald J. Trump and his paranoid loony bin followers, which include a disturbing number of white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazis, and John Birch dropouts. 
While speaking to a crowd at a rally in Greeley, Colorado late Sunday, Trump once again cast doubts on the mail-in ballots , encouraging people to get another ballot and mail that one in , too. Over and over: 
Who has sent their ballots in? And do you think those ballots are properly counted? Trump asked the audience, to which they replied No! 
Trump continued by expressing his skepticism and telling supporters to go get new ballots to ensure their vote is counted. 
 If you go to university center, theyll give you a new ballot, theyll void your old ballot, in some places they do that four or five times, so by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in.  
CNN said the comment was stoking skepticism because they dont have the wherewithal to call this what it really is: encouraging voter fraud. 
Liberal media my ass. 
And it appears to be having an effect. Some of Trumps followers have already taken this message to heart, and at least one has already been arrested for it . 
Between these clowns and the clowns that are going to make sure there isnt any illegal voting at the booths〞 i.e, instigate voter intimidation against Hispanics, Arabs, African-Americans and anyone else who doesnt look like a white Trump supporter 〞 one gets the feeling that election night is going to be a chaotic one.

I owe our readers an apology. 
In covering the ludicrous letter sent by FBI Director James Comey to Republicans that misleadingly suggested new emails had been uncovered implicating Hillary Clinton in criminal activity, out of an abundance of caution I gave Comey the benefit of the doubt . Maybe this wasnt overtly partisan electioneering by a Republican FBI director abusing his position? Maybe he just screwed up massively? 
That generous interpretation has all but been torched by Comey himself. Days after his letter made its way to Hillarys political enemies (including Donald Trump), Comey has yet to set the record straight. The scandal has completely fallen to pieces around him. His own behavior in producing the letter, legal experts say, bordered on criminal . But Comey remains silent. He doesnt even have the decency to admit he screwed up. 
And that silence has enabled Republicans to continue lying about what is happening. Trump himself tells his supporters that the FBI director is pursuing a criminal investigation against Clinton  a blatant lie that could easily be snuffed out with a single message by the suddenly bashful Comey. We are now leading in many polls, and many of these were taken before the criminal investigation announcement on Friday  great in states! 
〞 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2016 
Instead of setting the record straight, and doing a small part to repair the damage to American democracy he had done, Comey is telling sources that he will refuse to clarify the anti-Hillary letter until after the election . Trump is probably high fiving his campaign staff right now. 
NBCs Pete Williams (whose track record covering the botched FBI letter has been impeccable): Pete Williams reports that Comey is UNLIKELY to say anything more before the election 
〞 Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) October 30, 2016 
So having felt totally comfortable with hurting Hillary Clintons campaign (over what amounts to nothing), Comey now decides it would be unfair to Trump to come out with the truth. That is a level of partisanship that is hard to wrap ones head around. 
And sadly, many people seem to be unaware that this new Clinton scandal has been completely manufactured by Comey and the Republican Party. According to poll expert Nate Silver, the post-FBI letter polls show Clintons lead dropping. If Democrats keep their eyes on the prize, it shouldnt cost her the election, but it may diminish her chances of succeeding in creating the landslide required to completely eradicate Trumpism from American politics. 
You may not find that on the law books anywhere, but that is a crime nonetheless.

Louis C.K. just summed up the 2016 election in a few short minutes and he absolutely nailed it. And in case you were wondering, he is definitely with her. 
The Emmy award-winning actor sat down with Conan OBrien and explained that he isnt voting for Hillary Clinton because he thinks she is the lesser of two evils. He is voting for her because he thinks she is the best person for the job. 
He pointed out that Clinton wont just be the first woman to serve as president of the United States, she will be the first mother to hold the office. This he said, makes all the difference. Up until now, we have only had fathers in the White House. 
A great father can give a kid 40 percent of his needs. Tops, C.K. said. On the other hand, he continued, any mother, just a shitty mother, a not even trying mother? 200 percent. 
C.K. continued, pointing out that despite all the abuse she has taken over the years, she is still kicking a** and taking names. After giving what may be the best endorsement of Clinton that I have heard to date, he then broke the election down in terms that were crystal clear and added that if youre a liberal whos not gonna vote, youre a piece of shit. 
If you vote for Hillary youre a grownup; if you vote for Trump youre a sucker; if you dont vote for anyone, youre an asshole. 
Watch Louis C.K. explain why we need a tough bitch mother sitting in the Oval Office, here. Its definitely one you dont want to miss:

There is something ugly happening within the FBI and it could have major implications for the presidential election. 
On the heels of FBI Directors bone-headed, possibly illegal letter misleadingly suggesting Hillary Clinton is being re-investigated for her emails, the FBIs Records Vault Twitter account doubled-down on the pro-Trump Hillary smears by inexplicably tweeting the records of a 2001 FBI investigation into the pardon of Marc Rich a matter that was settled over a decade ago and has absolutely no bearing on the current election.

The ancient nontroversy was provided with absolutely zero context or explanation. In fact, this single cryptic tweet is the only thing the FBI Records Vault has tweeted in the past 36 hours. However, just like FBI Director James Comeys letter to Republicans, it will be used by Clintons opponents  particularly Trumps campaign  to fan the flames of scandal. 
The question on everyones mind is: Why? Why tweet this? And why tweet this just one week before an election that has already been marred with too many false scandals and misleading announcements? 
The decision is baffling and unprecedented. As demonstrated by Washington Post ＆s political reporter Peter Stevensons stunned reaction. So, an FBI account is tweeting things about the Clinton foundation. Appears to be from 2001 investigation into several of Clinton's pardons https://t.co/PDIwBYueIO

And Clinton campaign staffer Brian Fallowss even more stunned reaction: Absent a FOIA litigation deadline, this is odd. Will FBI be posting docs on Trump's housing discrimination in '70s? https://t.co/uJMMzX6rtI 
〞 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) November 1, 2016 
Comey has been rightly slammed for his decision to meddle in the election contrary to FBI policy not to get involved in politics, but even his critics were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder  a staunch Democrat  called Comey an honorable man who made a massive mistake. Now that assessment seems far too kind. The FBI is dumping opposition research to the public that hurts Hillary Clinton and favors Donald Trump. 
Not that the FBI Records Vault has been completely silent about Trump  but when it does speak about him, its tone is much more deferential. If the FBIs policy is to keep politics out of it, they are only achieving that when it comes to Trump. Two days previously, it tweeted a brief write up about Donald Trumps father. It describes him a philanthropist and the release appears mostly harmless. Fred C. Trump: Fred C. Trump (1905-1999) was a real estate developer and philanthropist.

At the same time, its carefully withholding information regarding its investigations into Donald Trumps businesses and his connections to the Russian government . This imbalance is so clear that it stretches the imagination to the breaking point to believe it was done on accident. 
As the race tightens in the closing week of the election, the fact that a government agency would repeatedly throw its weight behind one candidate over another  and do so in a way that is inherently dishonest  is infuriating. The damage being done to the FBIs claim to objectivity is possibly irrevocable.

After hundreds of thousands of petition signatures and months of begging on his show, Bill Maher finally managed to get President Obama to agree to a sit-down interview, and it aired on Real Time Friday night. 
During the interview, the two discussed a wide variety of subjects based on questions Maher compiled from what he thought his viewers would want to know, including Socialism, global warming, the agriculture industry and the military. They also discussed elitism and religion. President Obama answered every question candidly and without hesitation. He even joked around with Maher when the subject of marijuana legalization came up.

Former comedian and current Senator Al Franken (D-MN) wasnt joking when he suggested that FBI Director James Comey answer to the Senate regarding his unprofessional behavior. 
On Sunday, Franken called for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings concerning Comeys handling of the investigation into Hillary Clintons private server and whether or not she compromised national security. 
The Minnesota senator also said he believes Clinton can count on his states voters despite a last-minute campaign stop from Donald Trump, though the senator admitted that hes always nervous. 
I think that there should be hearings, and Im certain there will be hearings in the Judiciary Committee on this matter, the Franken told CNNs Jake Tapper on State of the Union. 
Frankens remarks reflect growing Democratic anger with Comey after the director told lawmakers 11 days before Tuesdays presidential election that his agency was reviewing new emails that may or may not be connected to their previous investigation. 
Comey, who previously cleared Clinton of any criminal negligence, sent a vaguely worded letter to top Republicans that falsely gave the impression that the FBI was reopening the Clinton investigation. 
Even more troubling is what weve heard from sort of the rogue elements of the FBI seemingly tipping off former (New York City) Mayor (Rudy) Giuliani that something was up. I mean, it just seems like 〞 thats not the FBI, Franken said. 
We will have hearings. Im sure that FBI Director Comey will be before us, Franken said. I think he should be able to answer questions about this, and he should be able to control the FBI. 
The senator also went to bat for the Clinton Foundation after Tapper questioned him on whether or not the organization should be shut down should Clinton win the election. However, the Minnesota lawmaker redirected his answer to address alleged illegal activities perpetrated by Donald Trumps foundation. 
I think that sometimes people should compare the two foundations, the Trump Foundation and the Clinton Foundation 〞 that the HIV drugs to millions of people vs. the Trump Foundation, which doesnt seem to have done much of anything for anybody other than Donald Trump, Franken said. 
Franken also reassured viewers that he wasnt worried about which way his home state would vote in the election. 
Trump is scheduled to visit Minnesota, a state that has not voted for a Republican since 1972, as one of his last few campaign stops before Tuesday. 
When asked if he felt Clinton was in trouble there, Franken replied, I dont think so. 
However, Franken admitted, Im always nervous. 
We run through the finish line, he said. This is what I tell everybody, I go to canvassing centers, I say, ＆Many of you have jobs, many of you have families 〞 ignore them. Get on the doors. 
Frankens nervousness is shared by millions of Americans who worry about the idiocy of some of their family, friends, and neighbors who seem hell-bent on handing the country over to Trump tiny slimy hands.

Well, that sure didnt take long. Only 12 hours into Election Day and Eric Trump has already broken the law. 
The Trump family isnt known for their ability to follow the law. Eric Trump apparently decided to start off his day by voting for his narcissistic dad and then breaking the law by posting a picture of his completed ballot on Twitter. Image via Buzzfeed 
This just happens to violate New York election law. Oops. But hey, its not like this has been a law for a long time right? Only 126 years. The law stipulates that any person who [s]hows his ballot after it is prepared for voting, to any person so as to reveal the contents ＃ is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
Eric Trump was quickly notified that his tweet, featuring a pic of his ballot, was illegal. Image via Buzzfeed 
The law was recently challenged by a group of voters who asked a federal judge to issue an injunction that would allow voters to take ballot selfies. The judge denied their request, ruling on Nov. 3 that, The publics interest in orderly elections outweighs the plaintiffs interest in taking and posting ballot selfies. 
According to the judge, the posting of ballot selfies would slow down the voting process, causing unnecessary delays, and threaten the guarantee of election integrity. 
Eric Trump eventually removed his tweet, but thanks to screenshots, it hasnt actually gone away. I have to ask at this point, cant these people get anything right? Seriously, they managed to screw up voting? By breaking the law? With Twitter ? Of course, they did.

Donald Trump is not very popular in New York City. Obviously, he lives in his big tower with his name in gold on the citys famed Fifth Avenue, but if the images of him walking into his polling place to vote for himself are any indication, what he thinks of himself isnt what the people of New York City think of him. 
As Trump went to vote with his wife Melania and daughter Ivanka, flanked by Secret Service agents, he was booed loudly by voters waiting in line. This isnt surprising if youve lived in New York, as I have. It is always a blue state, and it is also extraordinarily accepting of all people. Trump, however, throughout his travesty of a campaign run on hatred, fear, ignorance, and bigotry, has shown himself to be the exact opposite of most New Yorkers. 
If this video is any indication, it seems that the start of Election Day does not bode well for how it will end for Trump and his hateful supporters.

This entire election season has been insane and no one has broken it down like Seth Meyers has in his nightly segments A Closer Look. 
On the eve of the election, Meyers decided to focus this segment on how the two candidates have handled their campaigns during the final stretch. He took a few minor shots at Hillary, but the bulk of his time was spent incredulously trying to make sense out of what has gone on with Trump during the last 3 days in particular. He also shares a highly entertaining clip of President Obamas burns on Trump. 
While Hillary Clinton has been campaigning with mega-stars like Katy Perry, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Bruce Springsteen and Lady Gaga, Trump has＃Scott Baio. Trump couldnt seem to stop whining about Hillarys celebrities all weekend, even saying how horrible and inappropriate Jay-Zs lyrics were. Yes. This＃coming from the man who inspired the newest phrase p*ssygate and had the likes of Ted Nugent grabbing his crotch and referencing his blue balls at a rally over the weekend. 
After showing a clip of Trump bitching about all of these A-listers and saying he doesnt need them or their guitars and pianos, Seth had a message for the Republican candidate: 
Thats okay, Ive got an instrument for you Donald 〞 the worlds smallest violin, Meyers said. It should be noted that with your hands, it would be a regular size violin.

On Thursday, a senior Russian diplomat revealed that the Russian government did meet with members of Donald Trumps presidential campaign during the election. This disclosure reopens scrutiny concerning what role the Kremlin might have played in the president-elects close and contentious race against Hillary Clinton. 
Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that he never had contact with the Russian government. 
I can tell you I think if I came up with that theyd say, ＆Oh, its a conspiracy theory, its ridiculous, Trump told CBS4s Jim DeFede during an interview at his golf resort in Doral. I mean I have nothing to do with Russia. I dont have any jobs in Russia. Im all over the world but were not involved in Russia. 
When asked about outstanding loans with Russian banks or investors, Trump replied in July: 
Absolutely not. Its ridiculous. 
Meanwhile, during his campaign, Trump repeatedly refused requests to disclose his tax returns to the American people. 
Experts still speculate that Trumps tax returns could contain damaging information regarding his relationship with a foreign government or business interest. 
During an interview with Russias state-run Interfax News, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed that there were contacts with Trumps team during the election. 
Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage, Rybakov said. Those people have always been in the limelight in the United States and have occupied high-ranking positions. I cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives. 
We have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future Donald Trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes, Ryabkov was quoted as saying. 
We continue this work of course, he added . 
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Bloomberg that its normal practice for Russian Embassy staff to meet with U.S. presidential campaigns. 
Zakharova added that Clinton rejected similar requests to meet during the campaign. 
From Moscow with love comrade Trump.

Trump supporters are popping up all across the world. 
Check out the scene that unfolded in Jerusalems Old City this week. 
On a rooftop overlooking the walls of Jerusalems Old City, around 200 American-Israeli fans of Donald Trump gathered to proclaim their support for the Republican candidate, convinced he will be Israels best friend if elected. 
Wearing Make America Great Again baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didnt care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters. 
Trump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, thats what I like, David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday. 
Hes not a saint, but look at his achievements. Hes not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and hes not going to support the two-state solution, he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians. 
Trump has noticed the support he is getting in Israel. 
He even had a message for the people over there. 
This is a far cry from the attitude Obama has had all this time towards Israel. There are many things that Obama should be ashamed of from the past 8 years. Hes ruined America. Cops are criminals, criminals are victims, and people are confused on whether they are a woman or a man, and much much more.

With just 10 days to go before the most important election of our lifetime, Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans are soaring in the polls. The Friday announcement that the FBI would be re-opening its investigation into Hillary Clintons personal email server has not helped matters for Democrats, either. 
But none of this will matter if they are able to manipulate the vote. According to MRC Blog , thats why the left is going to drastic measures to drum up Democratic voters, expanding voting rights to include non-citizens in major cities nationwide. 
The latest notable city to do so is San Francisco, whose Election Day ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the citys public schools to vote in school board elections. Under this measure, people with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all would be allowed to vote. 
San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, who believes illegal aliens should be allowed to vote to bypass the broken immigration system in this country, made the following statement: 
One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesnt have a voice. Weve had legal immigrants whove had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say. 
Chiu is the son of Taiwanese immigrants. 
It is no secret that the vast majority of illegal aliens vote Democrat, because that is the party which is incessantly trying to buy their loyalty with an endless stream of handouts and promises of blanket amnesty. If it werent so, we wouldnt see all of these liberals pushing so hard to give illegals voting rights; they simply do so because it works in their favor, not because it is actually good for anyone. 
Major cities from sea to shining sea are following San Franciscos lead, which is just one more very important reason to vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 8.

The artificial intelligence system that has accurately predicted the outcomes of every U.S. presidential election since it was created in 2004 is forecasting a Donald Trump victory. 
Using various data, including engagement on Facebook and Twitter, the AI system found that Trump is outpacing Barack Obamas peak engagement numbers during his historic 2008 campaign by 25 percent. 
CNBC has more details : 
MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, the founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. 
The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democrat and Republican Primaries. Image Credit: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images 
If Trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years since Internet engagement began in full earnest, Rai wrote in a report, according to CNBC . 
However, before Trump supporters get too excited about the AI prediction, even Rai admits the social media-focused data model isnt perfect. Even if Trump is getting more social engagement than Obama in 2008, that certainly doesnt mean all those social media users will be voting for him. He explained it to CNBC like this: 
Rai said that his system would be improved by more granular data. He said that If Google was to give him access to the unique internet addresses assigned to each digital device, then he could collect data on exactly what people were thinking. For example, Rai said if someone was searching for a YouTube video on how to vote, then looked for a video on how to vote for Trump, this could give the AI a good idea of the voter's intention. He added that there would be no privacy concerns as these internet addresses would be anonymized.

US Elections Donald Trump claims the U.S. presidential election is ?rigged,? drawing condemnation from the political/media establishment which accuses him of undermining faith in American democracy. But neither side understands the real problem, says Robert Parry.
By Robert Parry
 "" Consortium News "" - The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the world?s ?gold standard? that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The ?wise men? of the system simply insist otherwise.
We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens? judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000).
Strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated.
The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nation?s leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized.
Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldn?t vote).
That unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. In effect, the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern non-slave owners.
Even after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the South, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century.
Women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks.
Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedy?s vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the South?s heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners.
However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixon?s Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960.
Nixon?s ?Treason?
So, by 1968, the Democrats? once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didn?t want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that ? with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided ? President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam.
The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixon?s campaign went behind Johnson?s back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnson?s Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixon?s emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam.
Though Johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called Nixon?s ?treason? ? from FBI wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election ? he and his top advisers chose to stay silent. In a Nov. 4, 1968 conference call , Secretary of State Dean Rusk, National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford ? three pillars of the Establishment ? expressed that consensus, with Clifford explaining the thinking:
?Some elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that I?m wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual [Nixon] elected,? Clifford said. ?It could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our country?s interests.?
Clifford?s words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of America?s electoral system in doubt, especially at the presidential level. The American people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that process.
To this day, the major U.S. news media will not directly address the issue of Nixon?s treachery in 1968, despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas. In a puckish recognition of this ignored history, the library?s archivists call the file on Nixon?s sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks their ?X-file.? [For details, see Consortiumnews.com?s ? LBJ?s ?X-File? on Nixon?s ?Treason. ??]
The evidence also strongly suggests that Nixon?s paranoia about a missing White House file detailing his ?treason? ? top secret documents that Johnson had entrusted to Rostow at the end of LBJ?s presidency ? led to Nixon?s creation of the ?plumbers,? a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers. The existence of the ?plumbers? became public in June 1972 when they were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee?s headquarters at the Watergate in Washington.
Although the Watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of election-year dirty tricks, the major U.S. news media never acknowledge the link between Watergate and Nixon?s far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier, sinking Johnson?s Vietnam peace talks while 500,000 American soldiers were in the war zone. In part because of Nixon?s sabotage ? and his promise to Thieu of a more favorable outcome ? the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to Johnson in 1968. [See Consortiumnews.com?s ? The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate .?]
In effect, Watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by Nixon?s strange personality. However, even though Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, he and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, who also had a hand in the Paris peace talk caper, reappear as secondary players in the next well-documented case of obstructing a sitting president?s foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaign.
Reagan?s ?October Surprise? Caper
In that case, President Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 American hostages then held in revolutionary Iran. Ronald Reagan?s campaign feared that Carter might pull off an ?October Surprise? by bringing home the hostages just before the election. So, this historical mystery has been: Did Reagan?s team take action to block Carter?s October Surprise?
The testimonial and documentary evidence that Reagan?s team did engage in a secret operation to prevent Carter?s October Surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding Nixon?s Paris peace talk maneuver.
That evidence indicates that Reagan?s campaign director William Casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostages? release before Election Day, after apparently consulting with Nixon and Kissinger and aided by former CIA Director George H.W. Bush, who was Reagan?s vice presidential running mate.
By early November 1980, the public?s obsession with Iran?s humiliation of the United States and Carter?s inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a Reagan landslide. When the hostages were finally let go immediately after Reagan?s inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, his supporters cited the timing to claim that the Iranians had finally relented out of fear of Reagan.
Bolstered by his image as a tough guy, Reagan enacted much of his right-wing agenda, including passing massive tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, weakening unions and creating the circumstances for the rapid erosion of the Great American Middle Class.
Behind the scenes, the Reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to Iran, mostly through Israel, what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for Iran?s cooperation in getting Reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration.
In summer 1981, when Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Nicholas Veliotes learned about the arms shipments to Iran, he checked on their origins and said, later in a PBS interview:
?It was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment. [This operation] seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration. And I understand some contacts were made at that time.?
Those early covert arms shipments to Iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the Iran-Contra Affair, with some of the profits getting recycled back to Reagan?s beloved Nicaraguan Contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaragua?s leftist government.
While many facts of the Iran-Contra scandal were revealed by congressional and special-prosecutor investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the origins of the Reagan-Iran relationship was always kept hazy. The Republicans were determined to stop any revelations about the 1980 contacts, but the Democrats were almost as reluctant to go there.
A half-hearted congressional inquiry was launched in 1991 and depended heavily on then-President George H.W. Bush to collect the evidence and arrange interviews for the investigation. In other words, Bush, who was then seeking reelection and who was a chief suspect in the secret dealings with Iran, was entrusted with proving his own guilt.
Tired of the Story
By the early 1990s, the mainstream U.S. news media was also tired of the complex Iran-Contra scandal and wanted to move on. As a correspondent at Newsweek, I had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before I left the magazine in 1990. I then received an assignment from PBS Frontline to look into the 1980 ?October Surprise? question, which led to a documentary on the subject in April 1991.
However, by fall 1991, just as Congress was agreeing to open an investigation, my ex-bosses at Newsweek, along with The New Republic, then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting Israel?s exposure on those early arms deals, went on the attack. They published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 ?October Surprise? case a hoax, but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording Casey?s attendance at a conference in London in July 1980, which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to Madrid to meet with senior Iranians regarding the hostages.
Although the bogus Newsweek/New Republic ?London alibi? would eventually be debunked, it created a hostile climate for the investigation. With Bush angrily denying everything and the congressional Republicans determined to protect the President?s flanks, the Democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigation.
Meanwhile, Bush?s State Department and White House counsel?s office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation, deep-sixing incriminating documents, and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoena.
Years later, I discovered a document at the Bush presidential library in College Station, Texas, confirming that Casey had taken a mysterious trip to Madrid in 1980. The U.S. Embassy?s confirmation of Casey?s trip was passed along by State Department legal adviser Edwin D. Williamson to Associate White House Counsel Chester Paul Beach Jr. in early November 1991, just as the congressional inquiry was taking shape.
Williamson said that among the State Department ?material potentially relevant to the October Surprise allegations [was] a cable from the Madrid embassy indicating that Bill Casey was in town, for purposes unknown,? Beach noted in a ? memorandum for record ? dated Nov. 4, 1991.
Two days later, on Nov. 6, Beach?s boss, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, convened an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case. The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bush?s reelection hopes in 1992.
At the meeting, Gray laid out how to thwart the October Surprise inquiry, which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the Iran-Contra investigation. The prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to George H.W. Bush?s reelection campaign. As assistant White House counsel Ronald vonLembke, put it , the White House goal in 1991 was to ?kill/spike this story.?
Gray explained the stakes at the White House strategy session. ?Whatever form they ultimately take, the House and Senate ?October Surprise? investigations, like Iran-Contra, will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the President ,? Gray declared, according to minutes . [Emphasis in original.]
Among ?touchstones? cited by Gray were ?No Surprises to the White House, and Maintain Ability to Respond to Leaks in Real Time. This is Partisan.? White House ?talking points? on the October Surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 1979-80 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findings.
Timid Democrats
But Bush?s White House really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received ? and a great deal arrived in December 1992 and January 1993 ? there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 Reagan campaign had conspired with Iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 Americans in order to ensure Reagan?s election victory.
That would have undermined the faith of the American people in their democratic process ? and that, as Clark Clifford said in the 1968 context, would not be ?good for the country.?
In 2014 when I sent a copy of Beach?s memo regarding Casey?s trip to Madrid to former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, who had chaired the October Surprise inquiry in 1991-93, he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task force?s dismissive conclusions about the October Surprise issue.
?The [Bush-41] White House did not notify us that he [Casey] did make the trip? to Madrid, Hamilton told me. ?Should they have passed that on to us? They should have because they knew we were interested in that.?
Asked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the task force?s dismissive October Surprise conclusion, Hamilton said yes, because the question of the Madrid trip was key to the task force?s investigation.
?If the White House knew that Casey was there, they certainly should have shared it with us,? Hamilton said, adding that ?you have to rely on people? in authority to comply with information requests. But that trust was at the heart of the inquiry?s failure. With the money and power of the American presidency at stake, the idea that George H.W. Bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was na?ve in the extreme.
Arguably, Hamilton?s timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave Bush?s team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear. Then, Hamilton?s investigative conclusion reinforced the ?group think? dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a ?conspiracy theory? when it was anything but. In the years since, Hamilton hasn?t done anything to change the public impression that the Reagan campaign was innocent.
Still, among the few people who have followed this case, the October Surprise cover-up would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed , that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored , and that some alibis for key Republicans didn?t make any sense .
But the dismissive ?group think? remains undisturbed as far as the major U.S. media and mainstream historians are concerned.

Past as Prologue
Lee Hamilton?s decision to ?clear? Reagan and Bush of the 1980 October Surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history. The findings had clear implications for the future as well, since the public impression about George H.W. Bush?s rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son, George W. Bush, in 2000.
Indeed, if the full truth had been told about the father?s role in the October Surprise and Iran-Contra cases, it?s hard to imagine that his son would have received the Republican nomination, let alone made a serious run for the White House. And, if that history were known, there might have been a stronger determination on the part of Democrats to resist another Bush ?stolen election? in 2000.
Regarding Election 2000, the evidence is now clear that Vice President Al Gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under Florida law than did George W. Bush. But Bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, and then on five Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to thwart a full recount and to award him Florida?s electoral votes and thus the presidency.
The reality of Gore?s rightful victory should have finally become clear in November 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of Florida?s disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that Gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under Florida law were counted.
However, between the disputed election and the release of those numbers, the 9/11 attacks had occurred, so The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and other leading outlets did not want the American people to know that the wrong person was in the White House. Surely, telling the American people that fact amid the 9/11 crisis would not be ?good for the country.?
So, senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery ? that the so-called ?over-votes? in which voters both checked and wrote in their choices? names broke heavily for Gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the ?under-votes? that hadn?t registered on antiquated voting machines. ?Over-votes? would be counted under Florida law which bases its standards on ?clear intent of the voter.?
However, instead of leading with Gore?s rightful victory, the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given Florida narrowly to Bush. They either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred.
On Nov. 12, 2001, the day that the news organizations ran those stories, I examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of Gore?s victory. In a story that day, I suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism. They had hid the reality for ?the good of the country,? much as Johnson?s team had done in 1968 regarding Nixon?s sabotage of the Paris peace talks and Hamilton?s inquiry had done regarding the 1980 ?October Surprise? case.
Within a couple of hours of my posting the article at Consortiumnews.com, I received an irate phone call from The New York Times media writer Felicity Barringer, who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of then-Times executive editor Howell Raines. I got the impression that Barringer had been on the look-out for some deviant story that didn?t accept the Bush-won conventional wisdom.
However, this violation of objective and professional journalism ? bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle ? was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier. It was about the future.
By misleading Americans into thinking that Bush was the rightful winner of Election 2000 ? even if the media?s motivation was to maintain national unity following the 9/11 attacks ? the major news outlets gave Bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis, including the diversionary invasion of Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush-won headlines of November 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004. [For the details of how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House, see Consortiumnews.com?s ? Gore?s Victory ,? ? So Bush Did Steal the White House ,? and ? Bush v. Gore?s Dark American Decade. ?]
A Phalanx of Misguided Consensus
Looking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy, there appears to be one common element: after the ?stolen? elections, the media and political establishments quickly line up, shoulder to shoulder, to assure the American people that nothing improper has happened. Graceful ?losers? are patted on the back for not complaining that the voters? will had been ignored or twisted.
Al Gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by Republican partisans on the Supreme Court, who stopped the counting of ballots in Florida on the grounds, as Justice Antonin Scalia said, that a count that showed Gore winning (when the Court?s majority was already planning to award the White House to Bush) would undermine Bush?s ?legitimacy.?
Similarly, Rep. Hamilton is regarded as a modern ?wise man,? in part, because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powers-that-be, that didn?t ruffle too many feathers.
But the cumulative effect of all these half-truths, cover-ups and lies ? uttered for ?the good of the country? ? is to corrode the faith of many well-informed Americans about the legitimacy of the entire process. It is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times, or in this case, assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest.
So, when Donald Trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him, many Americans choose to believe his demagogy. But Trump isn?t pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000. He actually praises Republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia.
Trump?s complaints about ?rigged? elections are more in line with the white Southerners during Jim Crow, suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they don?t succeed at ?stealing? the election from white people.
There is a racist undertone to Trump?s version of a ?rigged? democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process. He?s just not honest about what those flaws are.
The hard truth is that the U.S. political process is not democracy?s ?gold standard?; it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the voters.

 Here Are The Presstitutes Who Control American?s Minds :
I just heard an NPR presstitute declare that Texas, a traditional sure thing
for Republicans was up for grabs in the presidential election. Little wonder if this report on Zero Hedge is correct. Apparently, the voting machines are already at work stealing the election for Killary.
From my long experience in journalism, I know the American public is not very sharp. Nevertheless, it is difficult for me to believe that Americans, whose jobs, careers, and the same for their children and grandchildren, have been sold out by the elites who Hillary represents would actually vote for her. It makes no sense. If this were the case, how did Trump get the Republican nomination despite the vicious presstitute campaign against him?
It seems obvious that the majority of Americans who have been suffering terribly at the hands of the One Percent who own Hillary lock, stock, and barrel, will not vote for the people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren.
Furthermore, if Trump?s election is as impossible as the presstitutes tell us?Hillary?s win is 93% certain according to the latest presstitute pronouncement?the vicious 24/7 attacks on Trump would be pointless. Wouldn?t they? Why the constant, frenetic, vicious attacks on a person who has no chance?
There are reports that a company associated with Hillary backer George Soros is supplying the voting machines to 16 states, including states that determine election outcomes. I do not know that these reports are correct. However, I do know for a fact that the oligarchic interests that rule America are opposed to Trump being elected President for the simple reason that they are unsure that they would be able to control him.
It is hard to believe that dispossessed Americans will vote for Hillary, the representative of those who have dispossessed them, when Trump says he will re-empower the dispossessed. Hillary has denigrated ordinary Americans who, she says, she is so removed from by her wealth that she doesn?t even know who they are. Clearly, Hillary, paid $675,000 by Goldman Sachs for three 20-minute speeches, is not a representative of the people. She represents the One Percent whose policies have flushed the prospects of ordinary Americans down the toilet.
What is really disturbing is the pretense by the presstitute scum that Trump?s lewd admiration for female charms is deemed more important than the prospect of nuclear war. At no time during the presidential primaries or during the current presidential campaign has it been mentioned that Russia is being assaulted daily by propaganda, threatened by military buildups, and being convinced that the United States and its European vassals are planning an attack.
A threatened Russia, made insecure by inexplicable hostility and Western propaganda, is a danger manufactured by the neoconservative supporters of Hillary Clinton.
If the American people are really so unbelievably stupid that they think lewd remarks about women are more important than avoiding nuclear war, the American people are too stupid to exist. They will deserve the mushroom clouds that will wipe them and everyone else off the face of the earth.
Donald Trump is the only candidate in the primaries and the general election who has said that he sees no point in conflict with Russia when Putin has shown nothing but desire to work things out to mutual advantage.
In contrast, Hillary has declared the thrice-elected president of Russia to be ?the new Hitler? and has threatened Russia with military action. Hillary talks openly about regime change in Russia.
Surely, in a free media at least one person in the print and TV media would raise this most important of all points. But where have you seen it?
Only in my columns and a few others in the alternative media.
In other words, we are about to have an election in which the important issue has played no role. And yet allegedly we are the exceptional, indispensable people, a people?s democracy protected by a free press.
In truth, this mythical description of America is merely a cloak for the rule of the Oligarchs. And the Oligarchs are risking life on earth for their continual supremacy.

Unearthed tape: 'We should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win'
By Ken Kurson
 "" Observer "" - On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.
The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.
The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton?s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is ?rigged.?
Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).
?I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,? said Sen. Clinton. ?And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.?
Chomsky recalls being taken aback that ?anyone could support the idea?offered by a national political leader, no less?that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.?
Some eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency.
Regarding capturing combatants in war?the June capture of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants who came across the Gaza border via an underground tunnel was very much front of mind?Clinton can be heard on the tape saying, ?And then, when, you know, Hamas, you know, sent the terrorists, you know, through the tunnel into Israel that killed and captured, you know, kidnapped the young Israeli soldier, you know, there?s a sense of like, one-upsmanship, and in these cultures of, you know, well, if they captured a soldier, we?ve got to capture a soldier.?
Equating Hamas, which to this day remains on the State Department?s official list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, with the armed forces of a close American ally was not what many expected to hear in the Jewish Press editorial offices, which were then at Third Avenue and Third Street in Brooklyn. (The paper?s office has since moved to the Boro Park section of Brooklyn.) The use of the phrase ?these cultures? is also a bit of a head-scratcher.
According to Chomsky, Clinton was ?gracious, personable and pleasant throughout? the interview, taking about an hour to speak to, in addition to himself, managing editor Jerry Greenwald, assistant to the publisher Naomi Klass Mauer, counsel Dennis Rapps and senior editor Jason Maoz.
Another part of the tape highlights something that was relatively uncontroversial at the time but has taken on new meaning in light of the current campaign?speaking to leaders with whom our country is not on the best terms. Clinton has presented a very tough front in discussing Russia, for example, accusing Trump of unseemly ardor for strongman Vladimir Putin and mocking his oft-stated prediction that as president he?d ?get along? with Putin.
Chomsky is heard on the tape asking Clinton what now seems like a prescient question about Syria, given the disaster unfolding there and its looming threat to drag the U.S., Iran and Russia into confrontation.
?Do you think it?s worth talking to Syria?both from the U.S. point [of view] and Israel?s point [of view]??
Clinton replied, ?You know, I?m pretty much of the mind that I don?t see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as you?re not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them,? an answer that reflects her mastery of the facts but also reflects a willingness to talk to Russia that sounds more like Trump 2016 than Clinton 2016.
Shortly after, she said, ?But if you say, ?they?re evil, we?re good, [and] we?re never dealing with them,? I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them So I would like to talk to you [the enemy] because I want to know more about you. Because if I want to defeat you, I?ve got to know something more about you. I need different tools to use in my campaign against you. That?s my take on it.?
A final bit of interest to the current campaign involves an articulation of phrases that Trump has accused Clinton of being reluctant to use. Discussing the need for a response to terrorism, Clinton said, ?I think you can make the case that whether you call it ?Islamic terrorism? or ?Islamo-fascism,? whatever the label is we?re going to give to this phenomenon, it?s a threat. It?s a global threat. To Europe, to Israel, to the United States Therefore we need a global response. It?s a global threat and it needs a global response. That can be the, sort of, statement of principle So I think sometimes having the global vision is a help as long as you realize that underneath that global vision there?s a lot of variety and differentiation that has to go on.?
It?s not clear what she means by a global vision with variety and differentiation, but what?s quite clear is that the then-senator, just five years after her state was the epicenter of the September 11 attacks, was comfortable deploying the phrase ?Islamic terrorism? and the even more strident ?Islamo-fascism,? at least when meeting with the editorial board of a Jewish newspaper.
In an interview before the Observer heard the tape, Chomsky told the Observer that Clinton made some ?odd and controversial comments? on the tape. The irony of a decade-old recording emerging to feature a candidate making comments that are suddenly relevant to voters today was not lost on Chomsky, who wrote the original story at the time. Oddly enough, that story, headlined ?Hillary Clinton on Israel, Iraq and Terror,? is no longer available on jewishpress.com and even a short summary published on the Free Republic offers a broken link that can no longer surface the story.
?I went to my bosses at the time,? Chomsky told the Observer. ?The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody?even a direct Quote: from anyone?in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn?t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.?

How The Oligarchs Plan To Steal The Election By Paul Craig Roberts
 I am now convinced that the Oligarchy that rules America intends to steal the presidential election. In the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Trump.
Most likely you are unaware of what Trump is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this:
is not endeared to the oligarchs.
 Who are the oligarchs?
?Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve, a federal agency that put 5 banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks? balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless.
?The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power.
?The neoconservartives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China.
?The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs.
?Agribusiness (Monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their GMOs, hebicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops.
?The extractive industries?energy, mining, fracking, and timber?that maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply.
?The Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israell?s way.
What convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes? reporting and the facts on the ground.
According to the presstitutes, Hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in Trump supporters bothering to vote. Hillary has won the election before the vote. Hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner.
I am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillary?s public appearances are unattended but Trumps are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida:
?Trump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and stickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages.?
I know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity.
I also receive from readers similiar reports from around the country.
This is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: The media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only Americans but also the world, that Donald Trump is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote.
By controllng the explanation, when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundartion in the media. All media reports will say that it was a run away victory for Hillary over the misogynist immigrant-hating Trump.
And liberal, progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as Hillary takes us into nuclear war.
That the Oligarchy intends to steal the election from the American people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in Texas. The NPR presstitutes have declared that Hillary is such a favorite that even Republican Texas is up for grabs in the election.
If this is the case, why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change Trump votes to Hillary votes? Those voters who noted that they voted Trump but were recorded Hillary complained. The election officials, claiming a glitch (which only went one way), changed to paper ballots. But who will count them? No ?glitches? caused Hillary votes to go to Trump, only Trump votes to go to Hillary.
The most brilliant movie of our time was The Matrix. This movie captured the life of Americans manipulated by a false reality, only in the real America there is insufficient awareness and no Neo, except possibly Donald Trump, to challenge the system. Americans of all stripes?academics, scholars, journalists, Republicans, Democrats, right-wing, left-wing, US Representatives, US Senators, Presidents, corporate moguls and brainwashed Americans and foreigners?live in a false reality.
In the United States today a critical presidential election is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed by Hillary and the presstitutes. This is total failure. Democracy, once the hope of the world, has totally failed in the United States of America. Trump is correct. The American people must restore the accountability of government to the people.

By Mike Whitney "" Counterpunch"" - Without a shred of evidence and against the expressed wishes of his superiors at the Department of Justice, the head of the nation?s most prestigious law enforcement agency announced the reopening of an investigation into the mishandling of classified material by Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. The surprise announcement was delivered last Friday by FBI Director James Comey who knew that the action would create a cloud of suspicion around Clinton that could directly effect the outcome of the election.
Recent surveys suggest that that indeed has been the case, and that Hillary is now neck in neck with GOP contender Donald Trump going into the home-stretch of the bitterly contested campaign.
By inserting himself into the democratic process, Comey has ignored traditional protocols for postponing such announcements 60-days prior to an election, shrugged off the counsel of his bosses at the DOJ, and tilted the election in Trump?s favor. His action is as close to a coup d?tat as anything we?ve seen in the U.S. since the Supreme Court stopped the counting of ballots in Florida in 2000 handing the election to George W. Bush.
It is not the job of the FBI to inform Congress about ongoing investigations. Comey?s job is to gather information and evidence that is pertinent to the case and present it to the DOJ where the decision to convene a grand jury is ultimately made. Comey is a renegade, a lone wolf who arbitrarily decided to abandon normal bureaucratic procedures in order to torpedo Clinton?s prospects for election. The widespread belief that Comey is a ?good man who made a bad decision? is nonsense. He is an extremely intelligent and competent attorney with a keen grasp of Beltway politics. He knew what he was doing and he did it anyway. It?s absurd to make excuses for him.
In a carefully-crafted statement designed to deflect attention from his flagrant election tampering, Comey said this to his fellow agents:
?We don?t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed,? Comey said. ?I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.? ( CNN )
Let?s take a minute and parse this statement. First: ?We don?t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations.?
True, because it is not the FBI?s job to do so. The FBI?s job is to dig up evidence and refer it to the Justice Department. Comey is not the Attorney General although he has arbitrarily assumed her duties and authority.
Second: ?I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.?
?Supplement the record??
That?s a pretty suggestive statement, don?t you think? When someone says they?re going to supplement the record, you naturally assume that they?re going to add important details to what the public already knows. Obviously, those details are not going to be flattering to Hillary or there?d be no reason to reopen the case. So the public is left with the impression Comey is going to produce damning information that could lead to an indictment of Hillary sometime in the future.
This is precisely why normal protocols require that no new investigations be announced 60 days before an election. Why?
Because the public invariably assumes that ?investigation? equals ?guilt?. In other words, ?The FBI wouldn?t be investigating Hillary unless they had some dirt on her. Therefore, I?d better not waste my vote on Hillary.?
This is the logic upon which Comey?s dirty trick rests. He knows the effect his announcement will have because he is law enforcements version of Karl Rove, a bone fide partisan who?s mastered the dark art of political sabotage.
And just in case Comey?s announcement didn?t produce the desired effect (by destroying Hillary?s chances for victory), a former assistant director at the FBI, Tom Fuentes, appeared on CNN shortly after the announcement was made with more explicit information. Here?s a clip from the interview:
?The FBI has an intensive investigation ongoing into the Clinton Foundation,? Fuentes said Saturday, citing current and former senior FBI officials as sources
According to the CNN report, officials with the FBI and Justice Department met in Washington earlier this year to discuss opening an investigation into possible conflicts of interest between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton State Department.?
(? Former FBI Official: FBI Has An ?Intensive Investigation? Ongoing Into Clinton Foundation ?, Daily Caller)
Okay. So we?re no longer dealing with just classified emails. The FBI expanded its investigation and is now wading through the real sewage, the pay-to-play corruption scandal that surrounds that vast reservoir of illicit contributions known as the Clinton Foundation. In other words, the FBI is on to something big, really BIG. I can almost see them dragging poor Hillary off to the hoosegow in leg irons and shackles. Isn?t that the impression the above Quote: is supposed to produce? Here?s more from Fuentes:
?Several FBI field offices and U.S. attorneys offices pushed for the investigation after receiving a tip from a bank about suspicious donations to the Clinton Foundation from a foreign donor, according to the report .? (Daily Caller)
?Foreign donors?, ?suspicious donations?, smoky rooms, bundles of money. It all fits, doesn?t it? It?s all designed to increase suspicion and make Hillary look like a crook which, coincidentally, is the relentless mantra of the Trump campaign. Funny how the FBI and Trump appear to be reading from the same script, isn?t it? It?s almost like it was planned that way.
But what about the timing of all this? Is it really a coincidence or are Comey and Fuentes part of a one-two punch from the Trump campaign?
And, more important, what does the FBI actually have on Hillary? According to Fuentes:
?When the team looking at the Weiner computers went to the team of investigators who worked on the Clinton email case, and showed the emails to them earlier in the week, they said, ?This is really significant. We need to take this to the Director.? ( 2:05 to 2:23 video )
Repeat: ?This is significant?.
What?s significant? Neither Comey nor Fuentes nor the more than year-long investigation has uncovered anything, unless you think the ridiculous rehash of the 15-year old Marc Rich investigation (which popped up on the FBI website this week) is ?new news? that should alter the course of the election. This is pathetic. If they have something, show us. Otherwise, Ferme ta bouche.
Check this out from Thursday?s Wall Street Journal:
?As 2015 came to a close, the FBI and Justice Department had a general understanding that neither side would take major action on Clinton Foundation matters without meeting and discussing it first.
The public-integrity prosecutors weren?t impressed with the FBI presentation, people familiar with the discussion said. ?The message was, ?We?re done here,? ? a person familiar with the matter said.
Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions.
Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to ?stand down,?? a person familiar with the matter said .
As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn?t seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly.
In subsequent conversations with the Justice Department, Mr. Capers told officials in Washington that the FBI agents on the case ?won?t let it go,? these people said.? ( Wall Street Journal )
Can you see what?s going on here? There?s a nest of rogue agents running wild at the FBI who?ve been giving the DOJ the finger while they conduct their witch hunt on Hillary. And what have they achieved?
Nothing! So far, they have nothing.
Now, I?m not a fan of Madame Clinton either, in fact I wouldn?t vote for her if they rubbed me down with bacon grease and stuck me in a bear cage, but, c?mon now, do we really want rogue cops and self righteous bureaucrats inserting themselves into our elections and picking the winners?
That?s bullshit.
If the FBI has some solid proof of wrongdoing that will put Hillary behind bars for good, than I say, ?Bravo?. But until then, they should keep their damn hands off our elections!

Mr Netanyahu has presented this as a rebuff to those who accuse him of jeopardising Israeli security interests with his government?s repeated affronts to the White House.
In the past weeks alone, defence minister Avigdor Lieberman has compared last year?s nuclear deal between Washington and Iran with the 1938 Munich pact, which bolstered Hitler; and Mr Netanyahu has implied that US opposition to settlement expansion is the same as support for the ?ethnic cleansing? of Jews.
American president Barack Obama, meanwhile, hopes to stifle his own critics who insinuate that he is anti-Israel. The deal should serve as a fillip too for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic party?s candidate to succeed Mr Obama in November?s election.
In reality, however, the Obama administration has quietly punished Mr Netanyahu for his misbehaviour. Israeli expectations of a $4.5bn-a-year deal were whittled down after Mr Netanyahu stalled negotiations last year as he sought to recruit Congress to his battle against the Iran deal.
In fact, Israel already receives roughly $3.8bn ? if Congress?s assistance on developing missile defence programmes is factored in. Notably, Israel has been forced to promise not to approach Congress for extra funds.
The deal takes into account neither inflation nor the dollar?s depreciation against the shekel.
A bigger blow still is the White House?s demand to phase out a special exemption that allowed Israel to spend nearly 40 per cent of aid locally on weapon and fuel purchases. Israel will soon have to buy all its armaments from the US, ending what amounted to a subsidy to its own arms industry.
Nonetheless, Washington?s renewed military largesse ? in the face of almost continual insults ? inevitably fuels claims that the Israeli tail is wagging the US dog. Even The New York Times has described the aid package as ?too big?.
Since the 1973 war, Israel has received at least $100bn in military aid, with more assistance hidden from view. Back in the 1970s, Washington paid half of Israel?s military budget. Today it still foots a fifth of the bill, despite Israel?s economic success.
But the US expects a return on its massive investment. As the late Israeli politician-general Ariel Sharon once observed, -Israel has been a US ?aircraft carrier? in the Middle East, acting as the regional bully and carrying out operations that benefit Washington.
Almost no one blames the US for Israeli attacks that wiped out Iraq?s and Syria?s nuclear programmes. A nuclear-armed Iraq or Syria would have deterred later US-backed moves at regime overthrow, as well as countering the strategic advantage Israel derives from its own nuclear arsenal.
In addition, Israel?s US-sponsored military prowess is a triple boon to the US weapons industry, the country?s most powerful lobby. Public funds are siphoned off to let Israel buy goodies from American arms makers. That, in turn, serves as a shop window for other customers and spurs an endless and lucrative game of catch-up in the rest of the Middle East.
The first F-35 fighter jets to arrive in Israel in December ? their various components produced in 46 US states ? will increase the clamour for the cutting-edge warplane.
Israel is also a ?front-line laboratory?, as former Israeli army negotiator Eival Gilady admitted at the weekend, that develops and field-tests new technology Washington can later use itself.
The US is planning to buy back the missile interception system Iron Dome ? which neutralises battlefield threats of retaliation ? it largely paid for. Israel works closely too with the US in developing cyber-warfare, such as the Stuxnet worm that damaged Iran?s civilian nuclear programme.
But the clearest message from Israel?s new aid package is one delivered to the Palestinians: Washington sees no pressing strategic interest in ending the occupation. It stood up to Mr Netanyahu over the Iran deal but will not risk a damaging clash over Palestinian statehood.
Some believe that Mr Obama signed the aid package to win the credibility necessary to overcome his domestic Israel lobby and pull a rabbit from the hat: an initiative, unveiled shortly before he leaves office, that corners Mr Netanyahu into making peace.
Hopes have been raised by an expected meeting at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday. But their first talks in 10 months are planned only to demonstrate unity to confound critics of the aid deal.
If Mr Obama really wanted to pressure Mr Netanyahu, he would have used the aid agreement as leverage. Now Mr Netanyahu need not fear US financial retaliation, even as he intensifies effective annexation of the West Bank.
Mr Netanyahu has drawn the right lesson from the aid deal ? he can act against the Palestinians with continuing US impunity.

By Mike Whitney November 09, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" Counterpunch "" - This is what it must feel like to be on Death Row, to be waiting for the moment when the iron door clangs open for the last time and four burly guards escort you arm-in-arm to the room where your life will be extinguished. That same sense of dread hangs over the presidential election of 2016.
No one is happy about the election and no one anticipates better days ahead. America?s ?glory days? appear to be in the rearview mirror while the steady downward slide seems to be gaining pace. This year?s presidential campaign has brought all the anger, anxiety and frustration bubbling to the surface. Nerves are raw, people are on edge, and the trepidation is so thick you could cut it with a knife. All the recent surveys tell the same story: Americans are sick of the mudslinging, sick of the scandals, sick of the recriminations, sick of the two party duopoly, and sick of the two candidates, the two most distrusted and reviled candidates in the country?s 230 year history. This is from the New York Times:
?An overwhelming majority of voters are disgusted by the state of American politics, and many harbor doubts that either major-party nominee can unite the country after a historically ugly presidential campaign, according to the final pre-election New York Times/CBS News Poll
With more than eight in 10 voters saying the campaign has left them repulsed rather than excited, the rising toxicity threatens the ultimate victor. Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, and Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, are seen as dishonest and viewed unfavorably by a majority of voters
After weeks of Mr. Trump?s accusations that the election is ?rigged,? a little more than six in 10 of his supporters say they will accept the results as legitimate if he loses. More than a quarter of Mr. Trump?s supporters say they will probably not accept the outcome if Mrs. Clinton is declared the winner, and nearly 40 percent of them say they have little or no confidence that Americans? votes will be counted properly.?
( Voters Express Disgust Over U.S. Politics in New Times /CBS Poll, New York Times)
The growing sense of desperation in America today is palpable and it goes far beyond this one, isolated election cycle. The steady erosion of confidence in the nation?s main institutions is evident in Congress?s public approval ratings which seem to be stuck in single-digit territory. The public probably feels equal contempt for the Loretta Lynch Justice Department which is loaded with Clinton toadies that have done their best to quash any investigation into the illicit pay-to-play machinations at the Clinton Foundation. And, let?s not forget the media which has lost whatever shred of credibility it managed to salvage after its myriad of war-promoting lies about WMD, mobile weapons labs, aluminum tubes and Assad?s imaginary chemical weapons attacks, attacks that were invented from whole cloth at one of Washington?s many neocon think tanks where these fake ideas are typically hatched. The Forth Estate?s latest gambit is an idiotic attempt to prove that Vladimir Putin is trying to hack our thoroughly-corrupted Third World voting system to achieve some nebulous political gain. What a joke.
No, Hillary, Putin is not gaming the system like you did in the primaries with Bernie Sanders, nor did he put a gun to your head and force you to delete the 33,000 missing emails from your private server. That was your handiwork Ms. Clinton, although you have a done a masterful job in deflecting attention from yourself and passing the buck for your own sleazy, criminal activities onto Moscow.
But, back to the media. This from Gallup:
?Americans? trust and confidence in the mass media ?to report the news fully, accurately and fairly? has dropped to its lowest level in Gallup polling history, with 32% saying they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. This is down eight percentage points from last year.
Gallup began asking this question in 1972, and on a yearly basis since 1997. Over the history of the entire trend, Americans? trust and confidence hit its highest point in 1976, at 72%, in the wake of widely lauded examples of investigative journalism regarding Vietnam and the Watergate scandal. After staying in the low to mid-50s through the late 1990s and into the early years of the new century, Americans? trust in the media has fallen slowly and steadily. It has consistently been below a majority level since 2007
Bottom Line: the slide in media trust has been happening for the past decade. Before 2004, it was common for a majority of Americans to profess at least some trust in the mass media, but since then, less than half of Americans feel that way. Now, only about a third of the U.S. has any trust in the Fourth Estate, a stunning development for an institution designed to inform the public.? ( Americans? Trust in Mass Media Sinks to New Low , Gallup)
?Designed to inform the public????
You gotta be kidding? Droopy confidence in the media is a triumph for ordinary working people who have begun to see through the charade of ?unbiased coverage? and realize that the corporate owners of the press manipulate the news to shape perceptions and maintain their stranglehold on power. That?s what?s really going on, and that?s why a growing number of people have swarmed to Donald Trump?s campaign. They see Trump?s lack of political correctness as a sign that he is not owned by the Washington oligarchy of racketeers who invent teleprompter candidates like Obama and Clinton who are never certain what they actually believe until they see it printed in bold letters on the screen in front of them.
To large extent, Trump owes his shocking rise to the top of the GOP ticket to the fact that he shoots from the hip and that the media hates him. What was once a liability, has become an asset as trust for the despised media has plunged to depths never seen before.
But that doesn?t explain what?s really driving this election and why are the American people so overcome by desperation?
It?s all about economic insecurity. It?s all about the fact that standards of living are slipping, that an entire generation is bogged down with student debt, that all the good-paying jobs have been shipped to other countries, that family incomes are shriveling, that a good portion of the population feel threatened by immigration, that health care costs have skyrocketed, that retirement plans have been postponed, and that the great bulk of the nation?s wealth has been transferred to the 1 percent plutocrats and Wall Street landsharks who dictate policy through their Congressional lackeys and their allies at the Federal Reserve. That?s what the election is really all about.
People are waking up to the fact that the American dream is dead, that the US is no longer the land of opportunity, and that the lives of their children are going to be worse than their own, far worse. This is why everyone is so upset, so frustrated, so hopeless. They are looking for a political ally who will address their needs, and instead they get bromides on transgender bathrooms or ?glass ceilings? or any of the other soothing slogans the Democrats use to pacify the masses and to keep them in the flock. Only now it?s not working as well. Now a sizable portion of the blue collar vote has shifted into Trump?s camp mainly because they see through the phony Democrat rhetoric and all the job-eviscerating free trade deals they?ve pushed for years. Trump has skillfully tapped into the collective psyche of millions of working people who feel the Democratic Party tossed them under the track-hoe 30 years ago and never looked back. And, he?s right, too. The Dems have sold out their supporters, and it?s only going to get worse under Clinton, or should we say, Madame TPP. Here?s how Nile Bowie summed it up in a recent article at CounterPunch:
?Economic disempowerment and political disenfranchisement have accelerated under President Obama, to the detriment of the American middle class. White, blue-collar Americans have witnessed the offshoring of their jobs and the erosion of their status in society, and Trump has masterfully stroked their resentment and discontent by playing on their fears of Muslims, immigrants and minorities
Trump?s real problem with the Washington establishment is that he isn?t part of it. His campaign represents an insurgent faction of the oligarchical class that aims to displace and replace the standing political elites. Bipartisan opposition to Trump is grounded in the belief that he would be an unreliable proxy and a liability, someone too narrow and unpredictable to manage the common affairs of the ruling class and the US deep state.
Moreover, the US establishment is not interested in being led by such a contentious figure, who would draw protest and public opposition in a way that more conventional establishment candidates largely do not. For example, Trump?s rhetoric on immigration seems to engender more public outrage than the immigration policy under Obama, who has deported more people than any other president in history.? ( Election 2016: A Political System In Crisis , Nile Bowie, CounterPunch)
The big money guys don?t like Trump, and they make no bones about it. But Trump isn?t going away and neither are his followers, a vast number of whom will not respect the results of the election if Hillary wins. That?s a big problem for elites who like to manage the population through the popular election sham. Now all that?s at risk.
And it?s not like Trump hasn?t bent over backwards to ingratiate himself with the deep-state powerbrokers either. He has. His first olive branch to the elites was the selection of Mike Pence as his running mate. Pence is a died-in-the-wool establishment Republican neocon who can be trusted to pursue the same extremist agenda the GOP has followed since the Gingrich revolution. But there was another big move that Trump made that escaped the notice of the media and which really underscores his willingness to ?play by to the rules.? Here?s the story from Zero Hedge:
?Six months ago, Steven Mnuchin became finance chair for the Trump campaign. Having successfully helped to raise 10s of millions of dollars for the campaign, the former Goldman Sachs partner and Soros Fund management employee is now positioned for something much larger as Donald Trump reportedly told his aides today that he wants Mnuchin to serve as his Treasury Secretary.
Ironically, Trump has often criticized Clinton (and his former competitor Ted Cruz) for their links to the big banks:
?I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton,? Trump said in one debate.
But as we noted previously, he had no qualms, however, in hiring one of the most prominent Goldman alums to raise money for him.
for Trump, a self-professed ?anti-establishment? candidate, who has repeatedly stated he is not ?for sale to special interest groups?, his sudden call for the seemingly most ?Wall Street? of Wall-Streeters to become Treasury Secretary may come as a big surprise to some and will leave many of his supporters demanding an explanation.? ( Trump Wants Former Goldman Partner And Soros Employee To Serve As Treasury Secretary , Zero Hedge)
Another head of Treasury from G-Sax?
That figures.
Trump is great with the rabble-rousing ?take back your country? tirades and all the gibberish about the ?rigged? system. But he also knows how to cave in when it suits his interests. He knows he?s not going to be president without Wall Street?s nod, so he?s enlisted a trusted insider to take care of business at Treasury. It?s a signal to the bigwigs that they don?t have to worry about the Donald going off the reservation. (wink, wink) So much for Trump?s independence, eh?
And what can we say about Hillary Clinton that hasn?t been said a million times before?
Clinton, who still holds a slim lead in most of the polls, is clearly the establishment candidate in a year when hatred for the corrupt Washington oligarchy, has reached levels not seen in the last hundred years. The fact that Hillary can run for the nation?s highest office while being investigated by the FBI, while being savaged by the daily releases of new, incriminating emails (from WikiLeaks), and while promoting a hawkish, neocon-driven foreign policy that portends a direct military confrontation with Russia, speaks to the fact that traditional liberal Democrats are either still hoodwinked by the Democratic Party?s manipulation of identity politics or simply terrified of the alternative, Donald Trump.
And that?s why everyone is so utterly dejected and depressed about the election, because instead of voting for a candidate they really want or admire, most people are simply voting for the candidate that either disgusts or scares the hell out of them the least. What kind of choice is that?
In less than 24 hours, the most agonizingly-wretched campaign of all times will be over, the ballots will be counted, and the new president will be named. The only thing that is certain is that, whoever wins, we lose. Mike Whitney lives in Washington state. He is a contributor to Hopeless: Barack Obama and the Politics of Illusion (AK Press).

 TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone.
(APPLAUSE)
Sorry to keep you waiting; complicated business; complicated.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you very much.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: I?ve just received a call from Secretary Clinton.
(APPLAUSE)
She congratulated us ? it?s about us ? on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she ? she fought very hard.
Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.
(APPLAUSE)
I mean that very sincerely.
(APPLAUSE)
Now it?s time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.
(APPLAUSE)
It?s time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me.
(APPLAUSE)
For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people. . .
(LAUGHTER)
. . . I?m reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.
(APPLAUSE)
As I?ve said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their families.
(APPLAUSE)
It?s a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will.
(APPLAUSE)
Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I?ve spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country.
(APPLAUSE)
Tremendous potential. I?ve gotten to know our country so well ? tremendous potential. It?s going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
(APPLAUSE)
We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We?re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.
We will also finally take care of our great veterans.
(APPLAUSE)
They?ve been so loyal, and I?ve gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I?ve spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It?s going to happen.
(APPLAUSE)
We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be.
(APPLAUSE)
We?ll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great.
TRUMP: Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.
America will no longer settle for anything less than the best.
(APPLAUSE)
We must reclaim our country?s destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We?re going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again.
I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America?s interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone ? all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.
And now I?d like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory.
First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now.
(APPLAUSE)
Great people. I?ve learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents.
I also want to thank my sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And, where are they? They?re here someplace. They?re very shy, actually. And my brother Robert ? my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert?
(APPLAUSE)
My brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that?s OK. They?re great. And also my late brother, Fred. Great guy. Fantastic guy.
(APPLAUSE)
Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters; great, unbelievable parents.
To Melania and Don. . .

This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it?s tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all.
And Lara, unbelievable job, unbelievable.
Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much.
What a great group. You?ve all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people.
And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got ? we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it?s been ? it?s been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani.
(APPLAUSE)
Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings. That Rudy never changes. Where?s Rudy? Where is he? Rudy.
Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you, Chris.
The first man, first senator, first major, major politician, and let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he?s as smart as you get: Senator Jeff Sessions. Where is Jeff?
(APPLAUSE)
Great man.
Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up?
(LAUGHTER)
Is that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here.
Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I?ll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats: Dr. Ben Carson. Where is Ben?
(APPLAUSE)
Where is Ben?
TRUMP: And by the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family, Sarah ? thank you very much.
General Mike Flynn. Where is Mike?
(APPLAUSE)
And General Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign. And they?re special people and it?s really an honor. We have 22 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. We have just tremendous people.
A very special person who believed me and, you know, I?d read reports that I wasn?t getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He?s an unbelievable star. He is. . .
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: That?s right. How did you possibly guess? So let me tell you about Reince, and I?ve said this. I said, Reince ? and I know it, I know. Look at all those people over there. I know it. Reince is a superstar. But I said, ?They can?t call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win,? because you can?t be called a superstar ? like Secretariat ? if Secretariat came in second, Secretariat would not have that big, beautiful bronze bust at the track at Belmont.
But I?ll tell you, Reince is really a star. And he is the hardest-working guy. And in a certain way, I did this ? Reince, come up here. Where is Reince? Get over here, Reince.
(APPLAUSE)
Boy oh boy oh boy. It?s about time you did this, Reince. My God.
(APPLAUSE)
Say a few words. No, come on, say something.
RNC CHAIRMAN REINCE PRIEBUS: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you. It?s been an honor. God bless. Thank God.
TRUMP: Amazing guy.
Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we?ve done.
So I also have to say I?ve gotten to know some incredible people ? the Secret Service people.
(APPLAUSE)
They?re tough and they?re smart and they?re sharp, and I don?t want to mess around with them, I can tell you. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down on the seat. But they are fantastic people, so I want to thank the Secret Service.
(APPLAUSE)
And law enforcement in New York City. They?re here tonight.
(APPLAUSE)
These are spectacular people, sometimes underappreciated unfortunately, but we appreciate them. We know what they go through.
So, it?s been what they call a historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job. And I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job.
(APPLAUSE)
I look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years, or maybe even eight years. . .
(APPLAUSE)
. . . you will say, so many of you worked so hard for us, but you will say that ? you will say that that was something that you really were very proud to do and I can. . .
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning.
(APPLAUSE)
We?re going to get to work immediately for the American people. And we?re going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president. You?ll be so proud. Again, it?s my honor. It was an amazing evening. It?s been an amazing two-year period. And I love this country.
(APPLAUSE) Thank you. Thank you very much.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you to Mike Pence. Thank you.

November 14, "" Sputnik "" - After months of mudslinging and vitriol, US President-elect Donald Trump was greeted this week by a chummy President Obama with a cozy fireside seat at the White House.
Some media outlets sniped at Trump?s surprise election calling him the ?first reality TV star to become president?. In truth, the whole US political system seems to be a reality TV show.
In the weeks up to polling day on November 8, Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton and large sections of the US media were denouncing Trump as a ?Russian stooge?. Trump?s alleged friendliness towards Russian President Vladimir Putin was said to be proof that the Republican candidate was a ?Kremlin agent?. The Kremlin rejected the accusations as fatuous, pointing out that there was not a scintilla of evidence.
The claims, however, were not merely electioneering rhetoric to smear Trump. The Obama administration officially weighed in to accuse Russia of state-sponsored hacking of computer systems and ?interfering in the US election? to get Trump elected. The White House based its provocative allegations on an assessment made by the Director of National Intelligence and Department of Homeland Security. In other words, US accusations of Russian subversion could not have been leveled in a more serious way.
That means, if you follow this logic, that Trump is now heading to occupy the White House thanks to Russian espionage and propaganda influencing the vote in his favor. So, what then was outgoing President Obama doing holding photo ops with ?Comrade Trump? in the Oval Office, smiling and exchanging pleasantries? At one point, the incumbent Commander-in-Chief said he was ?rooting for Trump?s presidency to succeed because if it does then America will succeed?. Hold on a moment. Only days before this avuncular tete-a-tete marking the ?peaceful transition of power?, Obama?s administration and the mainstream media were labelling Trump as a Russian fifth columnist. Obama had also mocked Trump as being ?uniquely unqualified? to be president with access to the nuclear keys.
It is notable how US media claims of Russian spying and interference suddenly ceased the day after Trump was elected. Granted, there have since been lame attempts to make something sinister out of the news that Russian diplomats were admittedly in touch with Trump and Clinton campaign aides before the election. Apart from that damp-squib story that the New York Times and Washington Post tried to enliven, for the most part the ?Russian hacker? hue and cry before the election has strangely disappeared from the public arena. In the light of Trump?s cordial reception at the White House and the general acceptance by the Washington establishment including President Obama, defeated candidate Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media, that is stunning evidence that the whole anti-Russia bashing prior to the election was completely concocted and disingenuous. Think about it. How could Trump be painted one day as a beneficiary of Russian espionage, and then the next day literally, he is being feted as the ?45th president of the USA? ? whom, as Obama says, ?we are rooting for?? This demonstrates how degraded US statecraft has become. The government, its intelligence services and the country?s supposed quality news media are all prepared to fabricate and propagate lies against a foreign state ? Russia. Obviously, because how could serious concerns one day be so easily jettisoned the next?
Evidently, the demonization of Russia as a hostile, interfering foreign power trying to upend US internal politics is a gross falsehood. Otherwise why would Trump be officially accepted? And why have all the grave media claims just vanished? But a much more serious aspect to this official US propaganda is that it illustrates how Russia is being set up more generally as an ?enemy state?. Recall that US intelligence agencies were reportedly preparing to launch cyber attacks on Russian infrastructure all on the back of claims that Russia was hacking into the American presidential elections. If somehow US cyber attacks were carried out to cripple Russian industries and public utilities that would have constituted an act of war. Russia would have been obliged to respond, and the whole dangerous dynamic could have escalated to an all-out war.
If US government and its intelligence agencies, as well as supposedly independent news media, are seen to be so disingenuous, then that destroys their credibility on other matters. Can you believe anything they say about Russia with regard to allegedly threatening European security or committing war crimes in Syria? For his part, Donald Trump also plays a starring role in the US democracy charade. During their fireside meeting in the White House, the billionaire property tycoon called Obama a ?very good man? and said that he would seek his counsel in the future. This is the same ?very good man? whom Trump had earlier accused of being the ?creator of the ISIS [Daesh] terror group?. Along with Clinton, Trump had rallied his supporters to view Obama as a treasonous criminal for waging illegal wars in the Middle East.
Well, that?s a spectacular U-turn by the fiery, big-mouth anti-politician Trump. If he can so quickly accommodate himself to such apparently hated political enemies and effectively drop all charges then one wonders what else Trump will renege on? Will he really ?drain the swamp? of Washington?s oligarchic establishment? Will he deliver on ?making America great again? by investing in the ?forgotten people? who elected him? Will he really de-escalate American overseas militarism and NATO aggression towards Russia? It was surely a good thing that Hillary Clinton was not elected as president. Her warmongering record as former Secretary of State speaks for itself, as does her overt Russophobia.
But we should not be under illusions that a Trump presidency represents a new contrite and cooperative America. An American president is only ever a figurehead for a system and structure of power. That system relies on militarism and war to project US hegemony in the world. Without hegemonic relationships and imperialist conduct, US capitalism as we know it would collapse. And Trump is a raw-toothed capitalist. His early selections show a preference for further neoliberal deregulation of capital, as well as surrounding himself with his family and business cronies. Trump may be a pragmatic businessman inclined to form relations free from ideology. Potentially, that is a good thing for improving US relations with Russia and other foreign powers. Nevertheless, it would be naive to expect one individual to radically change a political system. It is not hard to imagine that when Trump enters the White House formally in 1o weeks that the military-intelligence-corporate apparatus of American capitalism will impress on him how the system works. And he will oblige. Trump?s polite deference to Obama this week, and vice versa, shows in an unintended way what Obama meant when he said ?we are all on one team?. That ?team? is the American oligarchy. It is not the American nation. Disenfranchised working-class Americans may simply have gotten Trump into the ?team? ? against their genuine aspirations for radical democratic change. The rapid disappearance of Russian hacker allegations as well as Trump?s anti-establishment bombast suggest that American ?democracy? is all just one giant reality TV show.",english,2016-11-15T00:54:38.908+02:00,informationclearinghouse.info,US,82758,Russian Spies and America?s Reality TV Election       : Information,1,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Lesley Stahl: Well, congratulations, Mr. Trump.
Donald Trump: Thank you.
Lesley Stahl: You?re president-elect.
Donald Trump: Thank you.
Lesley Stahl: How surprised were you?
Donald Trump: Well, I really felt we were doing well. I was on a string of about 21 straight days of speeches, sometimes many a day and the last two days I really-- I really had a pretty wild time. I did six speeches and then I did seven and--
Lesley Stahl: But everyone thought you were going to lose.
Donald Trump: I know, I did my final speech in Michigan at 1:00 in the morning and we had 31,000 people, many people outside of the arena. And I felt-- when I left, I said, ?How are we gonna lose?? We set it up a day before. And we had all of these people. And it was literally at 1:00 in the morning and I said, ?This doesn?t look like second place.? So we were really happy, I mean, it was-- these are great people.
Lesley Stahl: On election night, I heard you went completely silent. Was it a sort of realization of the enormity of this thing for you?
 Donald Trump: I think so, it?s enormous. I?ve done a lotta big things, I?ve never done anything like this. It is so big, it is so-- it?s so enormous, it?s so amazing.
 Lesley Stahl: It kind of just took your breath away? Couldn?t talk?
Donald Trump: A li-- a little bit, a little bit. And I think-- I realized that this is a whole different life for me now.
Lesley Stahl: Hillary called you. Tell us about that phone call.
Donald Trump: So Hillary called and it was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her, I mean, I can imagine. Tougher for her than it would have been for me. And for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldn?t have been nicer. She just said, ?Congratulations, Donald, well done.? And I said, ?I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor.? She is very strong and very smart.
Lesley Stahl: What about Bill Clinton? Did you talk to him?
Donald Trump: He did, he called the next day.
Lesley Stahl: Really? What did he say?
Donald Trump: He actually called last night.
Lesley Stahl: What did he say?
Donald Trump: And he-- he couldn?t have been more gracious. He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing he?s ever seen.
Lesley Stahl: He said that.
Donald Trump: He was very, very-- really, very nice.
Lesley Stahl: It was a pretty nasty campaign. Do you regret any of the things you said about her?
Donald Trump: Well, it was a double-side nasty.
Donald Trump: I mean they were tough and I was tough and-- do I regret? I mean, I?m sitting here with you now and we?re gonna do a great job for the country. We?re going to make America great again, I mean, that?s what-- it-- it began with that and that?s where we are right now. There are so many--
Lesley Stahl: So no-- no regrets about--
Donald Trump: I can?t regret. No-- I wish it were softer, I wish it were nicer, I wish maybe even it was more on policy, or whatever you want to say. But-- but I will say that-- it really-- it really is something that I?m very proud of I mean it was a tremendous campaign.
Lesley Stahl: Can we talk about yesterday with President Obama?
Donald Trump: Sure.
Lesley Stahl: 90 minutes. You were scheduled for what? 15?
Donald Trump: 15 max.
[Barack Obama: We talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy.]
Donald Trump: This was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half. And it could have gone on for four hours. I mean it was-- just-- in fact, it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say. And he told me-- the good things and the bad things, there are things that are tough right now--
Lesley Stahl: Like what?
Donald Trump: Well
Lesley Stahl: Give us some meat.
Donald Trump: Well, look I don?t want to divulge, but we talked about the Middle East, that?s tough. It?s a tough situation. I wanted to get his full view and I got his, you know I got a good part of his view.
Lesley Stahl: Uh-huh.
Donald Trump: And I like having that because I?m going to be inheriting that in a short period of time. I found him to be terrific. I found him to be-- very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects.
Donald Trump:?and we were talking about some victories, also, some things that-- that he feels very good about. But--
Lesley Stahl: Like--
Donald Trump: Well, what I really wanted to focus on was-- the Middle East, North Korea, Obamacare is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation.
Lesley Stahl: Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it.
Donald Trump: Well, he didn?t ask me, no, he told me-- you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that.
Lesley Stahl: You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you or--
Donald Trump: No, I think I?m a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I?m not. I?m actually not. I?m a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we had-- we had a very good chemistry going. And-- and I really found?it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting.
[Barack Obama: I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed then the country succeeds.]
Lesley Stahl: Was it at all awkward, at all, given what you?ve said about each other? You said he was not born in this country, he said things about you, he said you?re-- unqualified--
Donald Trump: You know what, it was a very-- it was a very interesting thing because-- I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like?
Lesley Stahl: Yeah.
Donald Trump: We never discussed what was said about each other. I said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. We never ever discussed what we said about each other?
Lesley Stahl: There was no awkwardness?
Donald Trump: I?ll be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And that?s strange. I?m actually surprised to tell you that. It?s-- you know, a little bit strange.
[Donald Trump: Thank you, sir.]
Lesley Stahl: Do you think that-- that your election is a repudiation of his presidency?
Donald Trump: No, I think it?s a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. They?ve let ?em down on the job front. They?ve even let ?em down in terms of the war front. You know, we?ve been fighting this war for 15 years--
Lesley Stahl: This was the message of your campaign.
Donald Trump: We?ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the-- and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of what?s been taking place over a longer period of time than that.
Lesley Stahl: You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16, whatever-- people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president?
Donald Trump: You know, I?ll conduct myself-- in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look at-- when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, it?s going to be America first. It?s not going to be what we?re doing?we, we?ve lost-- we?re losing this country. We?re losing this country. That?s why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big.
 Lesley Stahl: Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in?
 Donald Trump: Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I don?t want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be.
Lesley Stahl: Can you be?
Donald Trump: Sure I can. I can be easily, that?s easier. Honestly to do that, it?s easier.
Lesley Stahl: So let?s go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you?re going to do what you said or you?re going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall?
 Donald Trump: Yes.
Lesley Stahl: They?re talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?
Donald Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I?m very good at this, it?s called construction.
Lesley Stahl: So part wall, part fence?
Donald Trump: Yeah, it could be ? it could be some fencing.
Lesley Stahl: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?
Donald Trump: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we?re getting them out of our country, they?re here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we?re going to make a determination on the people that you?re talking about who are terrific people, they?re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley, it?s very important, we want to secure our border.
[Paul Ryan: We had a fantastic, productive meeting.]
Lesley Stahl: So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was the-- one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away?
Donald Trump: Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. We?re going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes--
Lesley Stahl: And you?ve got both Houses?
Donald Trump: And I have both Houses and we have the presidency, so we can do things--
Lesley Stahl: You can do things lickety-split.
Donald Trump: It?s been a long time since it?s happened.
Donald Trump: And they gave me a lot of credit. Don?t forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going to-- instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed.
Lesley Stahl: You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money.
Donald Trump: Yeah.
Lesley Stahl: You admitted you used to do it yourself. You have a transition team?
Donald Trump: And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests.
 Lesley Stahl: And you want to get rid of all of that?
 Donald Trump: I don?t like it, no.
 Lesley Stahl: You don?t like it, but your own transition team, it?s filled with lobbyists.
 Donald Trump: That?s the only people you have down there.
 Lesley Stahl: You have lobbyists from Verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby.
Donald Trump: Sure. Everybody?s a lobbyist down there--
 Lesley Stahl: Well, wait
 Donald Trump: That?s what they are. They?re lobbyists or special interests?
Lesley Stahl: On your own transition team.
 Donald Trump:?we are trying to clean up Washington. Look--
 Lesley Stahl: How can you claim--
 Donald Trump: Everything, everything down there-- there are no people-- there are all people that work -- that?s the problem with the system, the system. Right now, we?re going to clean it up. We?re having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we?re going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren?t happy about, but we?re putting on term limits. We?re doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.
Lesley Stahl: But you?re, but you?re basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them?
Donald Trump: I?m saying that they know the system right now, but we?re going to phase that out. You have to phase it out.
 Lesley Stahl: Let?s talk about your cabinet.
 Donald Trump: OK.
 Lesley Stahl: Have you made any decisions?
 Donald Trump: Yes.
Lesley Stahl: Tell us.
Donald Trump: Well, I can?t tell you that, but I have made--
Lesley Stahl: Oh, come on?
Donald Trump: You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. First of all, every major leader and probably less than major le- has called me, I?ve spoken to many of them and I?ll call the rest of them, but and I said, ?Boy, this really shows you how powerful our country is.? France and U.K. and I mean everybody, all over Asia?and very, just to congratulate. But it really shows the power of our country.
Lesley Stahl: One of the things you?re going to obviously get an opportunity to do, is name someone to the Supreme Court. And I assume you?ll do that quickly?
Donald Trump: Yes. Very important.
Lesley Stahl: During the campaign, you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights. Will you appoint-- are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade?
Donald Trump: So look, here?s what?s going to happen-- I?m going to-- I?m pro-life. The judges will be pro-life. They?ll be very?
Lesley Stahl: But what about overturning this law--
Donald Trump: Well, there are a couple of things. They?ll be pro-life, they?ll be-- in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody?s talking about the Second Amendment and they?re trying to dice it up and change it, they?re going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and--
 Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but then some women won?t be able to get an abortion?
 Donald Trump: No, it?ll go back to the states.
Lesley Stahl: By state?no some --
 Donald Trump: Yeah.
 Donald Trump: Yeah, well, they?ll perhaps have to go, they?ll have to go to another state.
 Lesley Stahl: And that?s OK?
Donald Trump: Well, we?ll see what happens. It?s got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.
 Lesley Stahl: Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what you?re taking on?
 Donald Trump: No.
 Lesley Stahl: Not at all?
 Donald Trump: I respect it. But I?m not scared by it.
Lesley Stahl: Now you?re not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your rhetoric--
Donald Trump: That?s only because they don?t know me. I really believe that?s only because--
Lesley Stahl: Well, they listened to you in the campaign and that?s--
Donald Trump: I just don?t think they know me.
 Lesley Stahl: Well, what do you think they?re demonstrating against?
Donald Trump: Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had it-- if you look at WikiLeaks, we had--
 Lesley Stahl: You think those people down there are?
 Donald Trump: Well Lesley?
 Lesley Stahl: are professional?
 Donald Trump: Oh, I think some of them will be professional, yeah--
Lesley Stahl: OK, but what about ? they?re in every city.
Lesley Stahl: When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, I mean, don?t you say to yourself, I guess you don?t, you know, do I have to worry about this? Do I have to go out and assuage them? Do I have to tell them not to be afraid? They?re afraid.
 Donald Trump: I would tell them don?t be afraid, absolutely.
Lesley Stahl: But that?s not what you?re saying, I said it-
 Donald Trump: Oh, I think, no, no, I think-- I am saying it, I?ve been saying it.
 Lesley Stahl: OK.
Donald Trump: Don?t be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don?t be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, ?Oh, that?s a terrible thing.? And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here.
It has been five full days since the election and anti-Trump demonstrations, driven in part by Hillary Clinton?s edge in the popular vote, have been significant.
When we interviewed him on Friday afternoon Mr. Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name or against his supporters.
Nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans, Latinos and gays by some of his supporters.
Donald Trump: I am very surprised to hear that-- I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that--
Lesley Stahl: But you do hear it?
Donald Trump: I don?t hear it?I saw, I saw one or two instances
Lesley Stahl: On social media?
Donald Trump: But I think it?s a very small amount. Again, I think it?s--
Lesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people?
Donald Trump: I would say don?t do it, that?s terrible, ?cause I?m gonna bring this country together.
 Lesley Stahl: They?re harassing Latinos, Muslims--
Donald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, ?Stop it.? If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.
During the campaign Mr. Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton?s email issue.
So we asked him if he plans to carry that out.
That part of the interview and a discussion with the next first lady, Melania Trump, when we come back.
On Friday, Donald Trump announced that he was changing the head of his transition team. Governor Chris Christie was replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Trump also added his three older children to the transition team.
Between now and Inauguration Day, the team must fill the new administration with 4,000 political appointees. That?s 4,000 new hires in just nine weeks.
When we talked to Donald Trump on Friday, the enormity and gravity of his new role was just sinking in. He was subdued. We wondered if as president he planned to temper his rhetoric, lower the flame.
Lesley Stahl: I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, I think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators.
Donald Trump: Yeah.
Lesley Stahl: You said that they were professionals?and you said it was unfair.
Donald Trump: I said some of them. Some of them are --
Lesley Stahl: But are you going to be tweeting and whatever you?re upset about just put out there when you?re president?
Donald Trump: So it?s a modern form of communication, between Face-- you know, Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram, I have 28 million people. 28 million people--
Lesley Stahl: So you are going to keep it up?
Donald Trump: It?s a great form of communication. Now, do I say I?ll give it up entirely and throw out, that?s a tremendous form-- I pick up-- I?m picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. I?m not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, ?cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. That?s very tough--
Lesley Stahl: But you?re going to do that as president?
Donald Trump: I?m going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I?m going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It?s a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It?s-- it?s where it?s at. I-- I do believe this, I really believe that, um-- the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they?re spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.
Lesley Stahl: Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail?
Donald Trump: Well, I?ll tell you what I?m going to do, I?m going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we?ve been talking about.
Lesley Stahl: You-- you know, you--
Donald Trump: And get the country straightened away.
Lesley Stahl: You called her ?crooked Hillary,? said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, ?Lock em? up.?
Donald Trump: Yeah. She did--
Lesley Stahl: Do you?
Donald Trump: She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things--
Lesley Stahl: I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might
Donald Trump: I don?t want to hurt them. I don?t want to hurt them. They?re, they?re good people. I don?t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.
With that
[Donald Trump: You look great, honey.]
We were joined by the next first lady, Melania Trump. She?ll be only the second foreign-born first lady. She?s from Slovenia. John Quincy Adams? wife Louisa was the first.
Lesley Stahl: You know, I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead. The enormity. You?re about to be first lady. Are you a little nervous about it? Little tense? A little--
Melania Trump: Well, there is a lot of responsibilities. And it?s-- a lot of work needs to be done. And-- it?s-- your-- stuff on your shoulders. And-- we will take care of it-- day by day. I will stay true to myself. I?m very strong and um-- tough and confident. And I will listen myself and I will do what is right and what feels to my heart.
Lesley Stahl: What kind of a first lady do you think she?s going to be?
Donald Trump: She will be terrific. She is very strong and very confident, but she?s very warm. And I think she?ll have a platform where she?ll really be able to do a lot of good. And that?s what she wants to do.
Lesley Stahl: You know, first ladies usually have a cause. And you?ve already said you?re interested in speaking out against bullying on social media.
Melania Trump: I think it?s very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt. And we need to teach them how to talk to each other, how to treat each other and to, to be able to connect with each other on the right way.
It?s an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign.
Lesley Stahl: What about your husband?s tweeting?
Melania Trump: Well, sometimes he-- it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following.
Lesley Stahl: So you never say to him, ?Come on??
Melania Trump: I did.
Donald Trump: She does--
Melania Trump: I--
Melania Trump: You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But
Lesley Stahl: Does he listen to you?
Melania Trump: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn?t--
Donald Trump: I?m not a big tweeter. I mean, I don?t do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across.
Lesley Stahl: If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him?
Melania Trump: Yes, I tell him all the time.
Lesley Stahl: All the time?
Melania Trump: All the time.
Lesley Stahl: And does--
Melania Trump: And--
Lesley Stahl: --he listen? Does he--
Melania Trump: I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. He?s an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it.
Lesley Stahl: Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval?
Donald Trump: Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way he?s affected every bit as much. Maybe more.
Lesley Stahl: Maybe more.
Donald Trump: And so we all had a dinner and I said, ?I would like to do this. I think I can do a great job.? And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed.
Lesley Stahl: Your son Barron, what is he, 10?
Melania Trump: 10.
Lesley Stahl: 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know?
Melania Trump: He knows. He knows--
Lesley Stahl: He knows?
Melania Trump: --what?s going on. And, he?s very proud of his dad.
Lesley Stahl: Now-- you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness, given--
Melania Trump: No.
Lesley Stahl: --what everybody was saying about everybody in the campaign?
Melania Trump: No. I didn?t feel it.
Lesley Stahl: Not at all?
Melania Trump: No.
Lesley Stahl: Tell us about the meeting.
Melania Trump: Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice.
Lesley Stahl: You know, she raised the two kids in the White House. But she had her mother living there. That?s an enormous help. Your parents are here, right?
Melania Trump: They?re here.
Lesley Stahl: Will they go to Washington with you?
Melania Trump: They might. We will see. We will discuss that.
Lesley Stahl: Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hair?s out of place. Are you both prepared for this?
Melania Trump: We are used to it.
Donald Trump: I will say, it is on a different scale now, ?cause I?ve had a lot. But I?ve never had anything like this.
Lesley Stahl: You won?t be able to walk down the street--
Melania Trump: I didn?t do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It?s another level, but it will continue.
At that point, the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues Mr. Trump faces.
Lesley Stahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation?
Donald Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don?t-- I haven?t made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think --
Lesley Stahl: Even though they leak so much?
Donald Trump: Well, there?s been a lotta leaking, there?s no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I?d answer a question like that.
Lesley Stahl: Sounds like you?re not sure.
Donald Trump: Well, sure, I?m not sure. I?d wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did.
Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna release your tax returns?
Donald Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I?m under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn?t care because I won the election very easily. So they don?t care. I never thought they did care.
Lesley Stahl: Now, for months, you were running around saying that the system is rigged, the whole thing was rigged. You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracy.
Donald Trump: I do.
Lesley Stahl: So do you still think it?s rigged?
Donald Trump: Well, I think the electoral ca-- look, I won with the Electoral College.
Lesley Stahl: Exactly.But do you think--
Donald Trump: You know, it?s--
Lesley Stahl: --it?s rigged?
Donald Trump: Yeah, some of the election locations are. Some of the system is. I hated--
Lesley Stahl: Even though you won you?re saying that--
Donald Trump: I hated-- well, you know, I?m not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There?s a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and there?s something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system.
Lesley Stahl: What about vacations? You?re not going to take any vacations? You?ve said that.
Donald Trump: We have so much work. There?s so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. We?re lowering taxes, we?re taking care of health care. I mean, there?s just so much to be done. So I don?t think we?ll be very big on vacations, no.
Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna take the salary, the president?s salary?
Donald Trump: Well, I?ve never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I?ll take $1 a year. But it?s a -- I don?t even know what it is.
Donald Trump: Do you know what the salary is?
Lesley Stahl: $400,000 you?re giving up.
Donald Trump: No, I?m not gonna take the salary. I?m not taking it.
In a moment, the Trump children join us and we will ask the president-elect where he stands on gay marriage, Obamacare, and ISIS.
On Tuesday, Donald Trump reached deep into America?s ranks of the discouraged and neglected, a largely white constituency. They feel their America hasn?t been great for a long time. And they accepted a promise to make it great again.
But Mr. Trump?s appeal wasn?t just to the disaffected. A map on election night was a sea of red, as he won support across the traditionally Republican South, but also deep into what used to be the blue wall of the Midwest.
Hillary Clinton came up short among her own supporters in large cities and affluent suburbs, among minorities and especially women. Just 51 percent of college-educated white women voted to make her the first female president. Her base didn?t come with the enthusiasm and the turnout she needed to fend off Donald Trump?s new and energized coalition.
On Friday Mr. Trump?s four older children ? Tiffany, Donald, Jr., Eric And Ivanka -- joined us to talk about their father?s surprising victory.
Lesley Stahl: Set the scene. It?s election night. Your father-- no one?s expecting him to win and it begins to dawn on you. Tell us about being in that room.
Eric Trump: You start to see the states falling. You start seeing Florida come in and he was declared the winner. And then you saw Ohio, you saw North Carolina. You saw Pennsylvania. You saw Wisconsin. I mean, you saw all these great states ? they?re all falling. And I think it was when we got Pennsylvania that we knew. And it was amazing. We were high fiving and we were all hugging as a family. And I actually think our father was the calmest of all of us even though he was really obviously the center of attention. So--
Lesley Stahl: He went quiet is what I heard.
Eric Trump: --it?s-- it?s--
Lesley Stahl: --is what I heard.
Eric Trump: --it?s a moment I?ll never forget, I can tell you that. I mean, the team was around and everybody?s cheering. And it was just-- it was-- it was a beautiful night.
Ivanka Trump: It is hard to put into words the experience or the emotion when your father becomes president of the United States of America. We had enormous pride, joy. It?s incredibly exciting. And we?re very grateful for the opportunity. And we take that opportunity very seriously.
Lesley Stahl: Tiffany?
Tiffany Trump: I mean I don?t think we can really prepare for our father becoming president. But we were all there together with everyone that?s worked so hard. And my dad has worked so hard. And it?s just ? it?s really awe-inspiring.
At some point that night and into the next day, calls from well-wishers started pouring in ? including, Mr. Trump told us, from both ex-presidents Bush. Neither of whom supported him in the campaign.
Lesley Stahl: What did the b=Bushes say when they called you?
Donald Trump: Well, it was very interesting. I got a call from Father Bush, who is a wonderful man. And he just said, ?Congratulations. It",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Donald Trump: They spent $1 billion against me on the word ?Temperament.? It was given by Madison Avenue. And they thought that, by temperament, they could maybe, you know, win the election. Obviously, it didn?t work because we?re here and they?re not. And I think my strongest asset is my temperament because I have a temperament where we win and we?re going to start winning again. We?re going to win on trade, we?re going to win at the borders, we?re going to knock out ISIS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Lets hope that it doesnt happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. 
If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day＃ 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are very concerned. Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are very confident about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trumps star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax＃ 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trumps star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trumps star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June ＃ 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidates star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted Nazi Republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece＃ 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, Why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement? 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ＆some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back. Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a Blue Lives Matter shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if Donald Trump loses the election＃ 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, On November 8th, Im voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, Im grabbing my musket. You in? 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today ＃ 
Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, Ive been buying a lot more ammunition, says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigans Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clintons political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month ＃ 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it.

In the wake of the final presidential election debate last week, the mainstream media was appalled that Donald Trump would not pre-emptively agree to not contest the outcome of the election . 
Trumps position reflects a growing faction of Americans who doubt the integrity and honesty of the American electoral system. In response, mainstream media sources have responded by vehemently insisting that rigged elections are  a myth . 
While rarely stated explicitly, the way American electoral politics is supposed to work is this: the population spends several months listening to the candidates accuse each other of terrible crimes, horrible ideas, and gross incompetence. Each candidate lists the ways he or she will use the power of government to force the winners policy preferences on the losers. Then, once the votes are cast, everyone is supposed to quickly accept the results, ignore everything that was said during the campaign, and immediately accept the winner as having an indisputable mandate to rule over everyone, including the sizable minority 〞 or even the majority, in many cases 〞 who either voted against the winner, or abstained. If there appears to be any irregularities in the vote, well, those should just be ignored because it would tear the country apart to drag out the election. If half the country feels its been cheated, well, tough luck and better luck next time. Democracy Breaks Down As (Perceived) Interventionism Increases 
This model can only work indefinitely under certain specific conditions. It can be workable when there is a perception that government is limited in its power, and extensive or abrupt change to government institutions are thought to be rare. It can also work in a small, culturally uniform society where there is a relatively small divide between socio-economic and ethnic groups. 
In the case of the United States, however, it appears that neither of these conditions apply. 
In the age of presidential executive orders, militarized police, uncountable federal laws, and a myriad of spy agencies empowered to watch Americans every move, gone is the perception that a loss in an electoral contest should simply be accepted without question. The president says he can issue laws with  a pen and ＃ a phone  without any need to consult Congress. The Libya war proved presidents can invade any country without so much as a debate in Congress. Meanwhile, the untouchable Supreme Court hands down decisions that are equivalent to Constitutional amendments, some of which can have enormous effects on the daily lives of ordinary citizens. 
In other words, the stakes are now reaching the point where an attitude of better luck next time doesnt cut it. Whether or not these fears are at times overstated is irrelevant. The fact is the perception of democratic lawlessness is growing. 
This situation is further complicated by the fact that the United States is an enormous conglomeration of different cultural and socio-economic groups spread out over a vast and varied geography. Many of these different groups distrust each other, and in a country where the president and the judiciary now rule largely by proclamation, there is reason to be fearful when the other guys candidate wins and yours loses. Democracy Can Work When the Stakes Are Low 
Contrary to the naive musings of some nostalgic conservatives, the United States was never united into a single cultural, linguistic, or socio-economic group. Those differences may have reached a low point during the twentieth century, but they were far larger in the 19th century than they are today. 
When you have a diverse population, however, the problem of who controls the government becomes far more important, and this concern grows as the state becomes more powerful. Writing on the topic of immigration and nationalism in Australia , Ludwig von Mises noted how powerful states exacerbate the problem of cultural divides. Could a laissez-faire regime be guaranteed to all residents of Australia, Mises notes, it would not matter at all if there were cultural mistrust between English-descended Australians and Asian newcomers. However, since laissez-faire liberalism has not been embraced, a familiar problem presented itself: 
The present inhabitants of [Australia] fear that some day they could be reduced to a minority in their own country and that they would then have to suffer all the horrors of national persecution to which, for instance, the Germans are today [i.e., the early 1920s] exposed in Czechoslovakia, Italy, and Poland. 
It cannot be denied that these fears are justified. Because of the enormous power that today stands at the command of the state, a national minority must expect the worst from a majority of a different nationality. As long as the state is granted the vast powers which it has today and which public opinion considers to be its right, the thought of having to live in a state whose government is in the hands of members of a foreign nationality is positively terrifying. It is frightful to live in a state in which at every turn one is exposed to persecution 〞 masquerading under the guise of justice 〞 by a ruling majority. It is dreadful to be handicapped even as a child in school on account of ones nationality and to be in the wrong before every judicial and administrative authority because one belongs to a national minority＃ 
It is clear that no solution of the problem of immigration is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state, which meddles in every field of human activity, or to that of the socialist state. Only the adoption of the liberal program could make the problem of immigration, which today seems insoluble, completely disappear. In an Australia governed according to liberal principles, what difficulties could arise from the fact that in some parts of the continent Japanese and in other parts Englishmen were in the majority? 
These same principles can be applied outside the subject of immigration as well. The existence of an interventionist state means any country composed of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic groups faces the same problem of one group being exploited by another group, with the help of state power. Change the term nationality to political party or interest groups, and one has a fair approximation of the problem of democracy in any interventionist state. 
In the presence of a relatively weak government, however, these concerns are often overstated. At the turn of the 20th century in the US, for example, the fact that Spanish-speakers were in the majority in New Mexico and many areas of the American West was irrelevant to the lives of the vast majority of Americans. The fact that Japanese immigrants and their descendant were out-competing white businessmen in California was simply not a matter of national importance. The fact that Oregon attempted to outlaw Catholic Schools was not a matter for presidential executive orders. Thanks to widespread suspicion of federal power at the time, the lack of a strong federal judiciary and a relatively weak presidency meant these issues remained largely local while public policy was haphazard. 
Voters have always feared losses in elections, but now more than ever, the voters may be justified in refusing to simply accept the outcomes of elections under an interventionist state, which meddles in every field of human activity. When that is the case, elections are not something to be taken lightly. Trumps remarks about rigged elections 〞 and public fears over the outcome 〞 are to be expected from voters with an immense fear of out-of-control state power. 
In response to all of this, the pundits and government class will tell us that everyone must double down on democracy, and that elections 〞 specifically federal ones 〞are sacred rituals never to be questioned. There will be a double standard, of course. A Trump victory will be questioned by the media and powerful politicians. But, in that case it will be the fault of the Russians , and not anything wrong with the system itself. The solution for the feds, of course, will be a federal takeover of the election system. If Clinton wins, then no questioning of the system will be tolerated at all. To question the outcome or the wisdom of these presidential contests will be denounced as scarcely less than sacrilege. 
The true solution to the problem remains far more practical, however. To paraphrase Mises, it is clear that no solution of the problem of elections is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state. So long as elections are increasingly perceived to be referenda on which side shall use the power of the state to crush the other side, faith in the electoral system will erode, and the potential for real violence will increase.

Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? 
All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. 
Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News ＃ 
Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. 
The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. 
If anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election, then they arent paying much attention, Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. 
And without a doubt, voting locations are soft targets that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters ＃ 
There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didnt have 15 or 20 years ago, said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee.  What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then thats certainly concerning. 
All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. 
Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. 
Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania ＃ 
We dont want to lose an election because you know what Im talking about, Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. Because you know what? Thats a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places . 
And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats＃ 
Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. 
Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. 
I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent, Moynihan said. You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat. 
In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . 
Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation ＃ 
According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. 
The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation  apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007  when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? 
Either way, it doesnt look good. 
After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. 
But Democrats dont like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters＃ 
Its un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that , Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book  Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America , previously told The Christian Science Monitor. Voting was very, very dangerous. I dont think anyones suggesting that were at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic. 
Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. 
But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? 
If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

Hillary Clinton claims shes the only candidate who will stand up to Vladimir Putin, but shes also the only candidate who apparently believes the United States is vulnerable enough to not prevent Russia from meddling in the November presidential election. 
Russian President Putin mocked that notion on Thursday. Vladimir Putin: ""Does anyone really think Russia could influence the American people's choice in any way? What,is the US a banana republic?"" pic.twitter.com/ngQhJR1AtP 
Does anyone seriously think that Russia can influence the choice of the American people? Putin told a group of academics in Sochi.

Hillary Clinton has repeatedly blamed Russia for the disclosures of campaign operative emails by Wikileaks. 
We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election, Clinton said at the second presidential debate. 
And believe me, theyre not doing it to get me elected. Theyre doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. 
Anything that goes wrong they blame Russia, Trump told a crowd in Ocala, Florida days later. We are being hacked because we have people who dont know what they are doing. They always blame Russia.

In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clintons personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony, Comey wrote. 
In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. 
These new revelations could undoubtedly spell trouble for Clinton as Trump has vowed to fully investigate her actions upon winning the election.

On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. 
The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. 
The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clintons Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is rigged. 
Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).",english,2016-10-29T13:10:17.353+03:00,infowars.com,US,2774,2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election,0,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/clinton-dc.jpg,0,1,278,0,278,conspiracy,Negative

By Vic Bishop - October 28, 2016 
With the U.S. presidential elections just around the corner, concerns about violence on Election Day seem to be escalating. Several schools have announced that they will not hold classes when the polls are open due to fears of potential violence. According to a recent survey of voters, A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are ＆very concerned. 
Voters have been very obsessive in whats been an emotional presidential election year. It is possible that supporters of the winning party make a public display showing off their victory to emphasize the painful fact that the other candidate has lost. Will they become easy targets? Whoever has lost may question the validity of the election and accuse of opposing side of manipulating the results. If it comes to this, should we expect civil unrest? It may be smart to stock up on a few days of extra food and water , so you can just hole up at home if need be. 
More details from the aforementioned survey can be found here . Election Year Has Been Filled With Political Hostilities 
Its no surprise people are apprehensive about Election Day. Voters in the U.S. have been passionately divided when it comes to the candidates. Many are fervent to keep the worse of two evils out of office. Decisions seem to be driven more by animosity towards one candidate, rather than by inspiration or vision offered by the other. 
Regardless if the voter survey offers an accurate representation of how Americans truly feel, we cannot deny that political discord has already incited violence in communities across the States. A summary here offers just a glimpse at the various incidents that have occurred during the year. Take a look below at the reception a man wearing a Trump hat received when attending a Clinton rally. 
Violence isnt exclusive to Clinton supporters. Two videos below show how Trump supporters respond to unwelcome demonstration by their opposition. 
With so much hatred and hostility surrounding the election, one can reasonably expect a violent, or at least unpleasant, conclusion. And any aggression will likely be exacerbated by the news media, which will make matters worse. Confidence In The Election Process Falters 
In addition to the looming question of who will be named president, another big unknown is how will U.S. citizens react? Will they accept the results of the election ? As per the previous mentioned voter survey, it seems that the confidence Americans once had in their election process is definitely floundering. Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are very confident about that. More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square. More than two-thirds of Trump voters say they worry the election returns could be manipulated. In contrast, eight in 10 of Clinton voters say the returns can be trusted to be fair and accurate. ( source ) Best Course is to Stay Prepared 
The drama of the election year will likely continue after November 8. It is reasonable to expect that some communities will experience civil unrest, particularly where divisions are strong. It only makes sense to prepare, at least at the basic level, with a weeks worth of storable food and water available in your home. It might also be smart to stock up your bug-out bag . Of course, some may feel the need to be a bit more aggressive with their preparedness plans: Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, Ive been buying a lot more ammunition, says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigans Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election. ( source )

An A.I. system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of #Hillary By Michael Snyder - November 3, 2016 
Just when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clintons mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails did not come from her private server, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry, and according to some reports there may be potentially thousands of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? 
Lets take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ After recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that appear to be pertinent to the email probe. In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation, Comey wrote the chairmen. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. 
At this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clintons closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clintons Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ We dont know what this means yet except that its a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So thats where we are＃ Is it a certainty that we wont learn before the election? Im not sure its a certainty we wont learn before the election. One thing is, its possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ 
If the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? 
It is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. 
So those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. 
But if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. 
It would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. 
In such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be fair until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. 
Meanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. 
And CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. 
Without Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. 
So if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. 
At this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.",english,2016-11-03T18:33:06.786+02:00,intellihub.com,US,,Will Barack Obama delay or suspend the election if Hillary is forced out by the new FBI email investigation?,0,https://www.intellihub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/election2016.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

When you put together everything weve learned about the corruption in our government and electoral system, it paints an ugly picture. Theres so much information that its difficult to see the large mosaic created by the tiny parts. 
UPDATED: Today, Julian Assange made a statement about the election . In recent months, WikiLeaks and I personally have come under enormous pressure to stop publishing what the Clinton campaign says about itself to itself. That pressure has come from the campaigns allies, including the Obama administration, and from liberals who are anxious about who will be elected US President. On the eve of the election, it is important to restate why we have published what we have. The right to receive and impart true information is the guiding principle of WikiLeaks  an organization that has a staff and organizational mission far beyond myself. Our organization defends the publics right to be informed. This is why, irrespective of the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election, the real victor is the US public which is better informed as a result of our work. The US public has thoroughly engaged with WikiLeaks election related publications which number more than one hundred thousand documents. Millions of Americans have poured over the leaks and passed on their citations to each other and to us. It is an open model of journalism that gatekeepers are uncomfortable with, but which is perfectly harmonious with the First Amendment. We publish material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere. When we have material that fulfills this criteria , we publish. We had information that fit our editorial criteria which related to the Sanders and Clinton campaign (DNC Leaks) and the Clinton political campaign and Foundation (Podesta Emails). No-one disputes the public importance of these publications. It would be unconscionable for WikiLeaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election. At the same time, we cannot publish what we do not have. To date, we have not received information on Donald Trumps campaign, or Jill Steins campaign, or Gary Johnsons campaign or any of the other candidates that fufills our stated editorial criteria. As a result of publishing Clintons cables and indexing her emails we are seen as domain experts on Clinton archives. So it is natural that Clinton sources come to us. We publish as fast as our resources will allow and as fast as the public can absorb it. That is our commitment to ourselves, to our sources, and to the public. This is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election. The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers. I spoke at the launch of the campaign for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, because her platform addresses the need to protect them. This is an issue that is close to my heart because of the Obama administrations inhuman and degrading treatment of one of our alleged sources, Chelsea Manning. But WikiLeaks publications are not an attempt to get Jill Stein elected or to take revenge over Ms Mannings treatment either. Publishing is what we do. To withhold the publication of such information until after the election would have been to favour one of the candidates above the publics right to know. This is after all what happened when the New York Times withheld evidence of illegal mass surveillance of the US population for a year until after the 2004 election, denying the public a critical understanding of the incumbent president George W Bush, which probably secured his reelection. The current editor of the New York Times has distanced himself from that decision and rightly so. The US public defends free speech more passionately, but the First Amendment only truly lives through its repeated exercise. The First Amendment explicitly prevents the executive from attempting to restrict anyones ability to speak and publish freely. The First Amendment does not privilege old media, with its corporate advertisers and dependencies on incumbent power factions, over WikiLeaks model of scientific journalism or an individuals decision to inform their friends on social media. The First Amendment unapologetically nurtures the democratization of knowledge. With the Internet, it has reached its full potential. Yet, some weeks ago, in a tactic reminiscent of Senator McCarthy and the red scare, Wikileaks, Green Party candidate Stein, Glenn Greenwald and Clintons main opponent were painted with a broad, red brush. The Clinton campaign, when they were not spreading obvious untruths, pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with Russia. The campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publications〞because none exists. In the end, those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them  a reason for censorship the First Amendment cannot tolerate. Only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate. WikiLeaks decade-long pristine record for authentication remains. Our key publications this round have even been proven through the cryptographic signatures of the companies they passed through, such as Google. It is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them. We have endured intense criticism, primarily from Clinton supporters, for our publications. Many long-term supporters have been frustrated because we have not addressed this criticism in a systematic way or responded to a number of false narratives about Wikileaks motivation or sources. Ultimately, however, if WL reacted to every false claim, we would have to divert resources from our primary work. WikiLeaks, like all publishers, is ultimately accountable to its funders. Those funders are you. Our resources are entirely made up of contributions from the public and our book sales. This allows us to be principled, independent and free in a way no other influential media organization is. But it also means that we do not have the resources of CNN, MSNBC or the Clinton campaign to constantly rebuff criticism. Yet if the press obeys considerations above informing the public, we are no longer talking about a free press, and we are no longer talking about an informed public. Wikileaks remains committed to publishing information that informs the public, even if many, especially those in power, would prefer not to see it. WikiLeaks must publish. It must publish and be damned.

Its almost over: the most divisive, theatrical, dramatic and dirty presidential campaign will be in the history books by this time tomorrow, with more than 130 million Americans expected to cast ballots across 50 states. However, just winning the popular vote will be insufficient: indeed, it may well be that the popular-vote winner does not win the electoral college. 
So which states should one be looking at, and how long is the final days drama set to continue? 
For the benefit of the traders out there, last week we showed a primer from Citigroup explaining when traders can hope to go home on election evening, according to which it was  all about Florida, North Carolina and Ohio . 
As Citi said, for traders hoping to capitalize on volatility next Tuesday as the election results come trickling in, it may all be over by early evening, at least if Trump loses. That is the calculation of Citis Steven Englander, who determined that if Trump loses either Florida or North Carolina or Ohio the math doesnt work and it tells us that the shift to Trump was not as pronounced as feared. Those states close at 7:00 or 7:30 ET. As Citi adds, even if Trump loses by a little in one of these states, it becomes almost impossible for him to win. It would take a tidal wave in a couple of states that look firmly Democrat. Citi helpfully added that the odds that he loses, say a Florida or North Carolina, but wins a Pennsylvania do not seem high at which point vol collapses, MXN rallies and we go home early. 
However, in a hint that tomorrow may be a very long night for traders  recall that Brexit was an all-nighter, which briefly saw ES halted limit down  the just released  no toss up  map from RCP based on the latest polling, shows Trump winning all three of these key states, and suddenly opening up the prospect not only for much more volatility, and yet another all-nighter, but potentially a Trump victory, something the market after todays furious rally, is certainly not prepared for. 
In any event, no matter the fate of these three states, here is a full preview of tomorrows election night. 
The following chart from Morgan Stanley summarizes what times polls close for any given state as well as the number of electoral votes afforded to each: 
As the FT observes , this years election is being fought hardest in 10 states: Arizona (11 electoral college votes), Colorado (9), Florida (29), Iowa (6), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4), North Carolina (15), Ohio (18), Pennsylvania (20) and Virginia (13). Clinton starts with an advantage in the electoral college and can afford to lose traditional battlegrounds such as Florida and Ohio. But if that happens, falling short in states such as Pennsylvania and North Carolina could prove fatal to her presidential ambitions. On the other hand, as noted above, if Trump does not win in Florida and Ohio, his chances of victory will be non-existent. One key could be the size of the turnout of Latino voters in Arizona, Florida and Nevada, which have large Hispanic populations. Another could be whether African-American voters go to the polls at a high rate in North Carolina and Ohio. 
What to watch for during the day, courtesy of Bloomberg : 12 am  Voting is already over in Dixville Notch, the New Hampshire hamlet that delivered a 5-5 tie in the 2012 race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. This time, Clinton received four votes, Trump two and Gary Johnson one, with a write-in vote for Mitt Romney, AP reported. Election Day has, finally, arrived. 6 am  Polls are open in eight states, including battlegrounds Virginia and New Hampshire, as well as in New York, where Clinton votes at a public school in Chappaqua, Trump at a public school in Manhattan. 8 am  VoteCastr, which aims to break Election Days traditional information embargo, goes live on Slate.com with estimates based on early voting in Florida, Colorado, Nevada and Iowa. Those are four of the eight states, representing 102 electoral votes, where VoteCastr is concentrating its data-crunching. More results, from more states, are made available in rolling fashion throughout the day. 2 pm  The VoteCastr/Slate partnership will probably have data from all the battleground states by now, reflecting broad election-day voting patterns. 4 pm  Late afternoon is when leaks and rumors about exit polls may begin to spread, as they did in the last three presidential elections. (The actual results of exit polls are supposed to be closely held by the TV networks and the Associated Press until voting closes, state by state.) Trust these early unconfirmed reports at your own peril, as they indicated in 2004 that the next president would be named Kerry and that Romney was on track to carry Florida in 2012. 
And after markets close, here is the hour by hour guide to closing polls: 6pm EST 〞 The first polls close in Indiana (11), home to Trump running mate Mike Pence, the states governor, and Kentucky (8). Both states are heavily Republican and likely to be carried by Mr Trump 7pm EST 〞 Polls close in the battleground states of Florida (29) and Virginia (13). As well as Georgia (16), South Carolina (9) and Vermont (3). The counting of ballots across the nation will go on well into Wednesday. You can, however, expect US media outlets to begin calling the races in safe Democratic and Republican states such as Kentucky, Vermont and South Carolina. But do not expect early calls in Florida or Virginia. In 2012, a winner was not declared in Florida until days after the election. A result in Virginia was not declared until after midnight. 7:30pm EST 〞 Polls close in two more important states: Ohio (18) and North Carolina (15). They also shut in West Virginia (5), where Trump is heavily favoured. Trump has done a lot of campaigning in Ohio, hoping to capitalise on the appeal of his protectionist trade policies in the rust belt state. In 2012, Mitt Romney had been declared the winner in four of the five states called before 8pm. President Barack Obama had won only Vermont. 8pm EST 〞 Things start to heat up. Polls close in the crucial states of Pennsylvania (20) and Michigan (16), and in Alabama (9), Connecticut (7), Delaware (3), the District of Columbia (3), Illinois (20), Kansas (6), Maine (4), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (11), Mississippi (6), Missouri (10), New Jersey (14), Oklahoma (7), Rhode Island (4) and Tennessee (11). Expect a flurry of declarations in safe Republican and Democratic states. If Mrs Clinton does not take Pennsylvania it will be a big blow 〞 especially because she chose to spend the last night of her campaign in Philadelphia alongside her husband and the Obamas. In 2012 it took almost two hours for Obama to be named the winner in the state. It was the first real battleground to be called. Maine is the first of two states that do not allocate their electoral college votes on a winner-takes-all system. Maine and Nebraska allocate some of their electoral votes by congressional district. 9pm EST 〞 The polls close in Colorado (9), Wisconsin (10) and Texas (38). They also shut in Louisiana (8), Minnesota (10), Nebraska (5), New Mexico (5), New York (29), South Dakota (3) and Wyoming (10). Look for early calls for Clinton in the population-heavy states of New York and New Jersey where she is firmly favoured. 10pm EST 〞 Polls are closing in western states Arizona (11), Idaho (4), Montana (3), Nevada (6) and Utah (6) as well as the mid-western farm state of Iowa (6). In 2012, this is when Mr Obama began really piling up the victories. Although it has a long tradition of voting Republican in presidential races, Arizona has been seen as more of a battleground this year. Utah is also interesting this year as conservative Mormon Evan McMullin has been polling well in the state and could even win it. 11pm EST 〞 The polls close in the biggest electoral prize on the map 〞 solidly Democratic California (55) 〞 as well as Washington state (12), Oregon (7) and North Dakota (3). 1am EST 〞 Polls close in Alaska (3) and Hawaii (4).

Time for the concession speeches? 
In 2008 and 2012, John McCain and Mitt Romney each gave nationally televised concession speeches shortly after midnight eastern time. 
But what if there is no winner by the end of the night? In the event that neither candidate gets to 270, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives will decide who the next president should be. 
* * * 
What are the main factors to watch? 
With polls showing voters having negative opinions of both major candidates, one of the key factors on election day could be the enthusiasm of their bases. If black, female, Latino and young voters do not turn out in significant numbers, it could represent a blow to the Clinton camp. Likewise, if white working class voters do not go to the polls in significant numbers it would hurt Mr Trump. 
Turnout among African-American voters looks likely to be lower than it was in 2008 and 2012. But Trumps provocative immigration policies mean a growing Hispanic electorate is expected to vote heavily against him. 
What other races should I keep an eye on? 
Americans will also be voting for 34 of the US Senates 100 seats and for all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Twelve governorships are up for grabs this year. The big question beyond the presidency is what will happen in the Republican-controlled Congress. A good night for Democrats would see them win five seats and regain control of the Senate (four if Mrs Clinton wins as that would mean vice-president Tim Kaine would cast the deciding vote) while also whittling down the Republicans 30-seat majority in the 435-seat House. It is extremely unlikely Democrats will regain control of the House.

As U.S. officials continue to accuse Russia of meddling with the U.S. presidential election, an accusation that they have provided no evidence whatsoever to support, lets review some of the U.S. governments history of meddling with elections in others countries. 
1. In 1951, the democratically elected parliament of Iran elected a man named Mohammad Mossadegh to be Irans prime minister. Mossadegh angered British Empire officials by nationalizing British oil interests in the country. 
British officials then turned to the CIA for assistance. In 1953, the CIA secretly fomented a violent coup in Iran, which succeeded in ousting Mossadegh from power and making the Shah of Iran the supreme unelected dictator of the country. 
To fortify the Shahs dictatorial hold on power, the CIA helped organize and train his domestic police force, the Savak, which was essentially a combination of the CIA, the NSA, and the military. Part of the CIAs training involved teaching Savak agents the art of torture. 
For the next 26 years, the Iranian people suffered under one of the most brutal and tyrannical dictatorships in the world, one that U.S. officials fully supported and called an ally and friend of the United States. 
In 1979, Iranians successfully revolted against the Shahs regime and ousted him from power. One result was not a restoration of the democratic system that had elected Mossadegh but rather another brutal dictatorship, this time a religious one. Another result is the bad relations between the Iran and U.S. governments that continue to exist today. 
2. In 1951, the Guatemalan people democratically elected a man named Jacobo Arbenz to be their president. Arbenz, however, was not satisfactory to U.S. officials, especially the national-security branch of the government, specifically the Pentagon and the CIA. The reason that U.S. officials opposed Arbenz was that he was a socialist, and U.S. officials considered a socialist president of Guatemala to be a threat to national security here in the United States. 
In 1954〞one year after the coup in Iran, the CIA fomented a violent military coup that succeeded in removing Arbenz from power and replacing him with one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in Latin American history, a man named Carlos Castillo Armas. The CIA had a kill list prepared for the coup, which Arbenz was able to escape by fleeing the country before Castillo was able to get him. The CIAs destruction of Guatemalas democratic system threw the nation into a 30-year civil war that ended up killing millions of Guatemalan people, especially many of the poor. 
3. In 1960 a man named Patrice Lumumba was elected Congos first prime minister after independence from Belgium. Lumumba spoke out against Western imperialism and refused to take sides in the Cold War, which caused the CIA to conclude that he was a threat to national security. The CIA orchestrated the assassination of Lumumba, which ended up taking place on January 17, 1961, just three days before President Kennedy, who liked Lumumba and who would have ordered the CIA to stand down, was to be sworn into office. 
4. In 1970 a man named Salvador Allende received a plurality of votes in the presidential election in Chile. Pursuant to the Chilean constitution, the election was thrown into the national congress. President Richard Nixon, his national-security team, the Pentagon, and the CIA concluded that because Allende believed in communism and socialism, he posed a grave threat to national security here in the United States. The CIA attempted to bribe members of the congress to vote against Allende. It also orchestrated the kidnapping of the head of Chiles armed forces, Gen Rene Schneider, who opposed a U.S. military coup in his country, especially since a coup would violate the countrys constitution. The kidnapping attempt on Schneider left him dead. 
The CIA then fomented a coup that took place on 9/11 1973 that violently ousted Allende from power and left him dead. Replacing him was army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in history. By the time Pinochets 17-year reign of military terror came to an end in 1990, he and his CIA-supported goons had incarcerated, raped, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of innocent people〞that is, people whose only crime was believing in socialism〞with the full support of the CIA, Pentagon, Nixon, and his national security team. 
Of course, there are also the more recent support of regime-change operations that ousted democratically elected presidents that the U.S. government disapproved of, such as in Ukraine and Egypt. 
And then there is the long list of countries where unelected dictators were targeted for regime change by the U.S. national security state and, where successful, replaced with a brutal unelected pro-U.S. dictator. Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria all come to mind. 
U.S. officials need to keep in mind that when they point their accusatory index finger at Russia for supposedly meddling in the U.S. presidential election, U.S. officials have, at the same time, three fingers pointing back at themselves.

3f91d34c7db43d61f260b4f68a603fa48d0c909d,0,John Chuckman,2016-11-11T10:19:31.373+02:00,What happened in this election?,"What happened in this election? By John Chuckman   John Chuckman 
Brushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election analysis, there are some observations which deserve attention. These unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of democracy, enlightenment, and progressivity. 
The election demonstrated perhaps better than ever, and better than has been generally been recognized, that America is, indeed, a plutocracy. It took a genuine American Oligarch, a multi-billionaire, a man with a lifetimes economic empire-building, to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically well-connected, a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well ever-flowing with money for their ambitions. 
It was the ever-flowing well of money, drilled by Bill Clinton with help from some extremely shady friends, such as Jeffrey Epstein, that made the Clintons keystone establishment figures in the Democratic Party. It was not personal charm or exceptional political generalship〞although Bill, in his heyday, displayed some of both of those〞that earned the Clintons their place, it was the money, the mothers milk of politics. In what is euphemistically called fund raising, many hundreds of millions of dollars were provided for the party over the last couple of decades by Bill Clintons efforts. 
Hillary fully appreciated the fact that money buys power and influence. She lacked Bills superficial charm, but she certainly more than shared his ambition. On the charm front, when she was ready to move into running for office, she adopted, perhaps under Bills tutelage, a kind of forced clown face with arched eyebrows, bugged-out eyes, and a smile as big as her lips would allow, and these expressions were accompanied by little gestures such as briefly pointing to various on-lookers or waving helter-skelter whenever she campaigned. 
Her gestures reminded me of something you might see atop a float in a Christmas Parade or of the late Harpo Marx at his most exuberant. These were not natural for her. They were never in evidence years ago when she spent years as a kind of bizarre executive housewife, both in a governors mansion and later in the White House, bizarre because she indulged her husbands non-stop predatory sexual behavior in exchange for the immense power it conferred on her behind the scenes over her far more out-going and successful politician-husband. 
Anyway, Hillary knew that gestures and simulated charm do not get you far in American politics. She determined to build a political war chest long ago, and there are many indications over the years of her working towards this end of making this or that change in expressed view, as when running for the Senate, when sources of big money suggested another view would more acceptable. She was anything but constant in the views she embraced because when she ran for the Senate she spent record amounts of money, embarrassingly large amounts. 
In her years of speaking engagements, she aimed at special interests who could supply potentially far more money than just exorbitant speaking fees. Later, in the influential, appointed post of Secretary of State〞coming, as it does, into personal contact with every head of government or moneyed, big-time international schemer〞she unquestionably played an aggressive pay for play with them all. Covering up that embarrassing and illegal fact is what the private servers and unauthorized smart phones were all about. 
A second big fact of the election is that both major American political parties are rather sick and fading. The Republican Party has been broken for a very long time. It hobbled along for some decades with the help of various gimmicks, hoping to expand its constituency with rubbish like family values, public prayer and catering to the Christian Right, and anti-flag burning Constitutional amendments, and now it is truly out of gas. That is precisely why a political outsider like Oligarch Trump could manage to hijack the party. 
He was opposed by tired, boring men like Jeb Bush, seeking to secure an almost inherited presidency, and a dark, intensely unlikable, phony Christian fundamentalist like Ted Cruz, and it proved to be no contest. It was a remarkable political achievement, but I think it was only possible given the sorry state of the party. 
The Republican Party had been given a breather, some new life, by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. He had an extremely mixed record as president, but he was popular, held in some affection, and did have a clear vision, but his effect on the party was not lasting. Trump could be seen as another Reagan, but I think the comparison is superficial. Trump literally hijacked the party, and he was not deliriously crowned by its establishment. 
The Republican Party itself was formed not long before Abraham Lincolns candidacy out of the remains of worn out and collapsed predecessors, including the Whigs and Free-Soil Democrats. Parties do not last forever, and here was Trump creating something of a minor political revolution inside a tired and fairly directionless old party, a phenomenon which I do not think was sufficiently noticed. 
The press was too busy attacking him from the start to take notice or do any intelligent analysis, and he was attacked precisely for the potential damage to the establishment he represented. His most promising quality is his potential for creating a new coalition of interests and one excluding the continuation of the neocon wars Hillary vigorously embraced and would expand. 
But the Democratic Party is in serious trouble, too. It has a great deal of internal rot, as the WikiLeaks material from the DNC clearly shows us. Arrogance, lack of direction, ignorance of the people it has always claimed to serve, bad decision-making, and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptoms. 
It would have been impossible for the party to have so made up its mind and committed its resources to Hillary Clinton without serious rot. She has always had strong negatives in polling, always been (rightly) suspected concerning her honesty. 
The WikiLeaks material tells us about many internal conflicts, including harsh high-level judgments of Hillarys decision-making, resentment over the back-stabbing character of daughter Chelsea who is said to resemble Hillary in her behavior and attitudes, and the belief of some that Hillary just should not have run. And, frankly, she had become for many a rather tiresome, used-up figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected. But they not only blindly supported her, they broke all their own party rules by internally and secretly working to defeat a legitimate and viable contender, Bernie Sanders. 
Sanders might well have been able to win the election for the Democrats, but their establishment was blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy out-of-hand. After all, there were Bill and Hillary beckoning to their running well of money. In hindsight, it might be just as well that Sanders was cheated out of the nomination. He proved a weak individual in the end, giving in to just the forces he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic followers completely let down. He may well even have been secretly bribed by money from the Clintons since he bought a fairly expensive property not long afterward. But, in any event, there he was, out on the hustings, supporting everything he ever opposed personified in Hillary Clinton. Men of that nature do not stand up well to generals and admirals and the heads of massive corporations, a quality which I do think we have some right to expect Trump to display. 
Another important fact about the election is that it was less the triumph of Trump than the avoidance of Hillary that caused the defeat. The numbers are unmistakable. Yes, Trump did well for a political newcomer and a very controversial figure, but Hillary simply did badly, not approaching the support Obama achieved in key states, again something reflecting the documented fact that she is not a well-liked figure and the party blundered badly in running her. But again, money talks, and the Clintons, particularly Bill, are the biggest fundraisers they have had in our lifetime. No one was ready to say no to the source of all that money. 
Now, to many Americans, the election result must seem a bit like having experienced something of a revolution, although a revolution conducted through ballots, any other kind being literally impossible by design in this massive military-security state. In a way, it does represent something of a revolutionary event, owing to the fact that Trump the Oligarch is in his political views a bit of a revolutionary or at least a dissenter from the prevailing establishment views. And, as in any revolution, even a small one, there are going to be some unpleasant outcomes. 
The historical truth of politics is that you never know from just what surprising source change may come. Lyndon Johnson, life-long crooked politician and the main author of the horrifying and pointless Vietnam War, did more for the rights of black Americans than any other modern president. Franklin Roosevelt, son of wealthy establishment figures, provided remarkable leadership in the Great Depression, restoring hopes and dreams for millions. Change, important, change, never comes from establishments or institutions like political parties. It always comes from unusual people who seem to step out of their accustomed roles in life with some good or inspired ideas and have the drive and toughness to make them a reality. 
I have some limited but important hopes for Trump. I am not blind or delirious expecting miracles from this unusual person, and after the experience of Obama, who seemed such a promising young figure but fairly quickly proved a crushing, bloody disappointment, I can never build up substantial hopes for any politician. And what was the choice anyway? Hillary Clinton was a bought-and-paid one-way ticket to hell. 
Trump offers two areas of some hope, and these both represent real change. The first is in reducing Americas close to out-of-control military aggressiveness abroad. This aggressiveness, reflecting momentum from what can only be called the Cheney-Rumsfeld presidency, continued and grew under the weak and ineffectual leadership of Obama and was boosted and encouraged by Hillary as secretary of state. Hillary, the feminists who weep for her should be reminded, did a lot of killing during her tenure. She along with Obama are literally responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of women and their families, many of them literally torn apart by bombs. 
The other area of some hope is for the welfare of ordinary American people themselves who have been completely ignored by national leaders for decades. George Bushs lame reaction to Hurricane Katrina (before he was internationally shamed into some action) has become the normal pattern for Americas national government when it comes to ordinary Americans. 
The truth is that the legacy of FDR has withered to nothing and no longer plays any role in the Democratic Party, and of course never did in the Republican Party. By welfare, I do not mean the kind of state assistance that Bill Clinton himself worked to end. Nothing can impress someone not familiar with Americas dark corners more than a visit to places like Detroit or Gary or Chicagos South Side, parts of New Orleans, or Newark or dozens of other places where Americans live in conditions in every way comparable to Third World hellholes. No, I mean the peoples general well-being. Trumps approach will be through jobs and creating incentives for jobs. I dont know whether he can succeed, but, just as he asked people in some of his speeches, What do you have to lose? Just having someone in power who pays any attention to the deplorables is a small gain. 
People should never think of the Clintons as liberal or progressive, and that was just as much true for Bill as it is for Hillary. His record as president〞apart from his embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office with a young female intern and his recruitment of Secret Service guards as procurers for women he found attractive on his morning runs〞was actually pretty appalling. He, in his own words, ended welfare as we know it. He signed legislation which would send large numbers of young black men to prison. He also signed legislation which contributed to the countrys later financial collapse under George Bush. He often would appoint someone decent and then quickly back off, leaving them dangling, when it looked like approval for the appointment would not be coming. His FBI conducted the assault on Waco, killing about eighty people needlessly. A pharmaceutical plant in Sudan was destroyed by cruise missiles for no good reason. There were a number of scandals, including the suicide of Vince Foster and the so-called Travelgate affair, which were never fully explained to the public. It was his secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, who answered, unblinkingly, a television interviewers question about tens of thousands of Iraqi children who died owing to Americas embargo, We think its worth it. He committed the war crime of bombing Belgrade. When news of the horrors of the Rwanda genocide were first detected by his government, the order secretly went out to shut up about it. No effort was made to intervene. 
No, any real change in America could never come from people like the Clintons, either one of them.

One likely winner to come out of the 2016 US presidential election: accuracy in polling. Obviously not past but future polling! 
Donald Trump, from the start of his campaign to capture the presidency, harangued his followers during the rallies with such unrestricted language that they felt liberated, able to speak out their minds without any fear of repression or recrimination. Well, at least not in the safety and camaraderie of their rallies; although also aware that politically correct America frowned on such openness, leaving them with a bi-forked tongue when applied to people who would likely judge, or categorize them . . . and that definitely applied to pollsters. 
One suspects that as much as 10 percent of the actual Trump vote came out of what we could call correctness-hiding, making total mockery of most pollsters. As a pertinent note I might add that while a student in operations research, I had a professor (Anant Negandhi, UCLA) who then claimed that polling involving issues with sociopolitical subjectivity was for the most part worthless because of the difficulty in modeling a survey which would correctively identify and quantify both the causal and intervening variables. Over a generation later, that difficulty has not really changed; nor has the need of pollsters to make a living, which may push them to sell smoke and mirrors to a well-funded political establishment. 
My own observation in weighing the impact of Trumps campaign on his followers, most particularly those in the construction trades, has been one where from the start of the campaign, and solidly after Trumps winning the Republican candidacy, these people who had expressed racial and ethnic bias with some trepidation were now doing so with little angst, as if their speech now had societys imprimatur and they had been godfathered by Donald Trump. 
After the cataclysmic misreading by a polling industry that has reverted from a science to an art . . . lagging miles behind the weather predicting science, one would expect the rigidity of science to take a critical role. So, of necessity if wishing to survive, the entire industry must undergo a true and complete overhaul. And that would be one positive result from this election: accuracy in polling. 
Now that Trump has become president-elect, to be escorted to the White House by a Republican Congress . . . and a conservative-in-waiting Supreme Court, will the specter of political correctness exit from American life? Not likely; but rest assured that there will be a great degree of accommodation for the 26 percent of American bigoted patriots (bigopats). [Read my article of June 16, 2016: Bigopats: ＆ Undocumented Largest Group in American Politics . ] 
To say that America is divided is a mini-characterization of incredible proportions that we, as a nation, will have incredible difficulty in overcoming . . . and perhaps never will. First, we must cope with the surreal realization that this United States of America isnt at all represented by Kansas being a dream away from Oz. The results from this last election have told us the naked truth about our nation; a truth that most Americans would like to keep under wraps: that more than a divided country split in two or more political camps, America is really a fallen Humpty Dumpty fragmented economically, socially, and politically in a way that it will take a Herculean effort to be able to put it back together again. An effort that requires drastic change: both political and institutional. 
Once upon a united America, we insist in telling ourselves, we were the land of promise and hope; the great experiment in humankind: economic opportunity, the American dream, the mythical melting pot, freedom, dignity and self-realization. But we seem to forget, that it was the economic wellbeing in the America of generations past that did provide the glue that kept our multi-part Humpty Dumpty (diverse America) sitting smilingly on the wall, looking condescendingly over the rest of the world. 
Globalization has melted that glue; and economic change for that symbolic American middle class, whether coming from the Right (Trump) or the Left (Sanders), is unlikely to improve their lot. But at the end of the day, neither would have that middle path that Hillary Clinton would have walked.

US officials claim that if anybody produces evidence of voter fraud in the coming weeks, it will be a Russian plot to undermine peoples confidence in American democracy. 
Blaming Russia for the Democratic National Committee and Clinton Foundation hacks proved so successful at distracting Americans from the contents of the WikiLeaks emails that US officials are now attempting to blame future evidence of voter fraud on Russia too. 
The claims are being disseminated to the public via mainstream media pipelines as we speak. Reuters, operating as an organ of state propaganda, reported the claims by anonymous U.S. officials on Thursday: 
 The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. 
But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. 

They said that they did not have specific evidence of such a plan, but state and local election authorities had been warned to be vigilant for hacking attempts.  
The keyword in the second quoted paragraph is  some.  Truth mixed with lies. Reuters, in collusion with the state, are using confusion, paranoia and heavy-duty spin. Dizzy yet? 
The mainstream media has now laid the groundwork to ensure that if Clinton wins the election and is accused of voter fraud, any evidence provided to substantiate the claim can be instantly dismissed as fake Russian propaganda and not investigated properly. 
In essence, if the ruling party says that a specific document is false, then without question, it must be false. The Democrats will dismiss evidence of voter fraud as another conspiracy theory and Russian plot. 
The Democrat establishment has spent months attempting to deflect from the content of WikiLeaks emails by alleging the source of the hack was Russia. Now they are attempting to capitalize on the narrative by blaming future voter fraud evidence on Russia as well.",english,2016-10-27T01:33:04.112+03:00,investmentwatchblog.com,US,68648,Rigged Election: US Blaming Russia For Future ＆Falsified Voter Fraud,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

By Michael Snyder 
Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Lets hope that it doesnt happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day＃ 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are very concerned. Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are very confident about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trumps star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax＃ 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trumps star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trumps star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June ＃ 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidates star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted Nazi Republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece＃ 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, Why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement? 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ＆some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back. Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a Blue Lives Matter shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if Donald Trump loses the election＃ 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, On November 8th, Im voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, Im grabbing my musket. You in? 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today ＃ 
Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, Ive been buying a lot more ammunition, says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigans Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clintons political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month ＃ 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it.",english,2016-10-27T07:06:41.479+03:00,investmentwatchblog.com,US,68648,Get Ready For Civil Unrest: Survey Finds That Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

The eighth Congressional District of Minnesota is a working class area in Eastern Minnesota. It has voted for a Democrat in the last four Presidential elections. It has a Democrat Congressman and will likely be the most expensive Congressional race this year. 
Usually, a Democrat Presidential candidate would win. But a recent poll held a shock: 
Donald Trump is up 12 points! 
And more: Trump is winning among women. And the Democrat Party is losing members. Theyre becoming Independents. 
What The Data Says did this analysis of the Eighth Congressional District of Minnesota: 
 Trump is beating Hillary by 12 points: Our poll shows Republican Donald Trump with a 12-point lead over Clinton, 47 percent to 35 percent  Trump is winning with women: leading Clinton 41 percent to 39 percent.  Dems are crossing over: the number of Democrats dropped from 34 percent in 2014 to 27 percent in 2016. The number of independents jumped from 31 percent two years ago to 41 percent this year.

Voters in Arlington and Amarillo complained that when they highlighted the box to select Trump/Pence, it switched to Clinton/Kaine. Now numerous other Texans have gone public on social media to report similar problems. However, election officials in Texas are denying that there is a problem. Typically, weve found its voter error with the equipment, Frank Phillips, Tarrant Countys election administrator, told WFAA . Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates ＃ or do something with the wheel＃.There is not an issue with the equipment. Are all these examples just voters making mistakes or inaccurately reporting what happened? Or could there be a real problem with electronic voting machines in Texas?

DENVER (CBS4) An ongoing CBS4 voter fraud investigation has uncovered a dozen cases where Coloradans are suspected of voting twice. Previous CBS4 Investigations revealed ballots cast in the names of Coloradans who had been dead for months sometimes years- before votes were cast in their names. 
In six of the new cases, voting records show the same people voting twice in Colorado elections. In another six cases, people are suspected of voting in Colorado and another state during the same election cycle.

Florida Governor Busted Attempting To Toss Thousands Of Mail-In Ballots 
A federal judge on Saturday blocked Florida Governor Rick Scotts attempt to throw out tens of thousands of mail-in ballots, then publicly reprimanded him. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued a blistering caution to Scotts top election official on a lawsuit about vote-by-mail ballots. 
According to ABC News , the judge accused Governor Scott appointed Secretary of State Ken Detzner of delaying a hearing on the lawsuit, so that he could use every second available to run out the clock, . That means, there would not be enough time to address the lawsuit. Then, Judge Walker said the governors man, Detzner, was in effect committing an undeclared war on Florida voters rights.

by James Wesley, Rawles | SurvivalBlog 
There is a substantial risk that Hillary Hitlery Clinton will become our next President. She is notoriously anti-gun, and has made many promises to her gun-grabbing campaign donors to give gun control (read: civilian disarmament) her top priority. 
Consider the guidance in this article just a contingency. You can simply ignore it, if Donald Trump is elected. (Since he is outspokenly pro-gun.) But if Clinton is indeed elected, then gun, ammunition, and magazine prices will surely start to rise immediately. And by the time she actually takes office, prices might well have already doubled or tripled, and shortages of some itemparticularly standard military caliber ammunition and many 11+ round magazineswill be widespread. 
To be ready for the possible Hill-ection, I recommend that you take the following steps: 
Get Ready＃ Withdraw some substantial cash (but not more that $9,700 ), and keep it well-hidden, at home. Pay off your credit card balances, so that you will have your full purchase credit limit available. Consult gun show calendars , and make plans to attend local shows. Note that many gun shows are now run as three-day shows, open Friday through Sunday. Check the advertised hours closely, and call to confirm days and show hours with the gun show management, before traveling. You will want to be there on Friday , to avoid the Saturday mob scene. Expend a vacation day from your work, if need be. 
Get Set＃ Make prioritized shopping lists Set bookmarks in your browser for ordering the particular items that you have in mind to purchase. Make detailed comparison price lists (or an electronic spreadsheet, if you are so inclined),in descending order of prices so you that wont pay too much for what you buy. This research takes time , but that translates into saving money , so it is time well spent. 
＃Go! On Election Night immediately after announcement that Hitlery is the projected winner in the Electoral College, go online and place orders with Internet sellers that take orders 24 hours per day , such as : CDNN Sports , GunMagWarehouse , Brownells , KeepShooting.com , CheaperThanDirt , Midway , Cabelas (now part of Bass Pro Shops), J&G Sales , Buds Gun Shop , Dans Ammo , Lucky Gunner , Able Ammo , Ammunition Store , Ammunition Depot , Copes Distributing , Centerfire Systems , and GlockPro . Our Editor At Large Mike Williamson recently mentioned that SlickGuns.com is now selling Federal .22 Long Rifle ammo for as little as 6 cents per round . (I suspect that .22LR will again become scarce and jump back up over 15 cents per round, if Hitler In Heels is elected.) Keep in mind that many manufacturers such as SIGArms , Beretta USA , and The Beta Company also take direct Internet orders. Stay up and complete as many of your planned orders as you can afford, late into the night. It you tarry and say: Ill do it tomorrow, then you will probably be disappointed to to see Out Of Stock showing at many vendor web sites. 
The Morning After Set your alarm clock, and start making calls to the mailorder vendors that dont take Internet orders, starting right at 8 AM, Eastern Time. Be outside the door of your local gun shop before it opens. Bring lots of cash. 
In The Weeks Following Attend guns shows in your state. If it is possible under your state and local laws, buy used private party guns , with no paper trail. If that is not an option in your state, then buy a pre-1899 antique cartridge rifle , such as a 7mm Model 1895 Chilean Mauser. These are exempt from paperwork, in most states.) Watch auction sites such as GunBroker.com and GunAuction.com closely, for guns that are on your purchase list. Concentrate on Buy It Now items , since the multi-day auctions will probably be bid up to stratospheric heights, in the panic period following election day. 
What To Buy Start with your own needs, then with your childrens needs, and then with barter in mind, as follows: First Priority: Magazines and ammunition for your primary battle rifles Second Priority: Magazines and ammunition for your primary carry pistols Third Priority: Stripped AR-15 and AR-10 receivers (for later assembly) 
saig Fourth Priority: Secondary firearms, plus magazines and ammunition, to match Fifth Priority: Magazines and ammunition for planned acquisitions that will expand your battery of gunsincluding guns for children and grandchildren Sixth Priority: Magazines and ammunition for barter or re-sale. 
Note: Be sure to buy only either original military contract or original factory-made full capacity magazines dont buy aftermarket junk! 
Any extra magazines that are intended for barter should be of the types that will be in the highest demand. Examples include: AR-15/M16, M14, Mini-14, AR-10, FAL, Glock, S&W M&P, Beretta, and SIG. In particular, I predict that 33-round Glock magazines , 30-round Beretta Model 92 magazines , 100-round Beta C-MAGs , and 40-round Mag-Pul AR-15 PMAGs will all be in particularly high demand.) 
Potential Resistance In some families, a spouse might object to you making such purchases. Sit down and dispassionately show them the history of other scare and banperiods, and point out how much prices rose. (For example: stripped AR-15 lower receivers jumped from $60 each to $300 each, during the last big scare.) Tell them: This is the equivalent of having the foreknowledge of what Dow Jones stocks will double or triple in price. It is wise to buy low and sell high. If need be, promise your spouse that you will sell off half of what you plan to buy, after prices have doubled. That will leave the purchase cost of what you then retain, effectively at zero . 
In Closing Dont panic, but recognize that Hitlery Clinton will probably act swiftly to restrict privately-owned firearms and accessories, using Executive Orders. Her transition team might even prepare them before she takes office. Most likely would be an import ban on magazines that can hold more than 10 cartridges, for civilians. Another likelihood is an import ban on military style firearms and/or parts sets. Another possibility is reclassifying 80% complete receivers. She might also direct the BATFE to expand the definition of Destructive Devices to include semi-automatic shotguns with detachable magazines. (Such as the Saiga-12, which is already import banned.) Plan accordingly. 
And regardless of the outcome of the upcoming election, you should have already spread out your guns, ammo, optics, and field gear between hidden places in several houses owned by members of your family, and in underground caches. DO NOT keep all your eggs in one basket!

Are the elite foreshadowing the future of America?! 
It seems so. 
All throughout the month of October, mainstream media has made cryptic statements, scenarios, and outcomes regarding what America could look like if Donald Trump loses the presidential race. 
In an article from The Boston Globe, one scenario includes a potential American uprising. During the presidential debates and campaigns, Mr. Trump has alleged the election as being rigged, in favor of Hillary Clinton. According to a Bloomberg News poll, 56% of Trump backers believe the election will be ＆＆rigged＃ even though the election is really a SELECTION. 
However, The Washington Times has also questioned the same thing: Will there be some type of uprising, civil unrest, or some other triggered outcome if Donald Trump were to lose the elections? 
Its also very cryptic to note how former Republican Joe Walsh made this interesting Twitter statement as of October 26th, 2016: If Trump loses, Im grabbing my musket. 
Then theres the Russian threat, which is constantly making its way into mainstream news. According to Western sources, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who is an ally of Vladimir Putin, has warned Americans to vote trump or face nuclear war 〞 claiming that the Republican candidate is the only person who can prevent an escalation in tensions between Moscow and Washington. He has also said that: The only way they can get worse is if a war starts. 
And while the American government continues to constantly blame Russia for alleged cyberthreats, cyberattacks, and election hacks 〞 we know this is all propaganda in preparation for world war.

At 41-28 Trump should be leading the over all poll. Over sampling is happening somewhere. 

Heres the thing: Bernie voters and black Americans were already Democrats. (Even if she gets 100% of them (which she wont) shes not broadening her numbers beyond her own party . . . which is a mere 29% of the electorate.) 
Lets recap: 29% of the country are Democrats, 29% are Republicans and 42% are Independents. See here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAopWX9Mzgs 
Whoever wins Independents wins the election. 
Trump is more than doubling Hillarys position with Independents. Hes leading in the single largest voting bloc in the country . . . yet all the mainstream media propaganda polls are pretending like Hillarys ahead. 
(Of course she isnt. Shes been losing this entire cyclewith the media grossly oversampling Democrats and undersampling Independents to create a synthetic paper advantage for her.) 
But things get worse for Hillary than the ass-kicking shes getting [as a Status Quo candidate] in a Change election, vis-a-vis Independents: For a Democrat to win a national election, they have to carry 92% of the black vote. Trump is now polling between 25-30% of the black vote. (Meaning that Hillary isnt even coming remotely close to the benchmark shed need to win.) 
So you have Hillary hemorrhaging African-Americans, Independents and blue collar workers. 
Yet every mainstream media poll is lying to you and telling you shes winning. 
The math doesnt work.

In an impassioned reminder that the freedoms and safety enjoyed by millions of Americans are at risk, actor John Voight has issued a clarion call for voters to save their nation by preventing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton from being elected. 
We were once a country of freedom, and now we are becoming a country of tyranny. We are witness to our own people burning down and looting our own cities: Ferguson, Milwaukee, Orlando, Baltimore, said Voight in a new video. We are all witness to our own people killing our police. 
Voight has said in the past that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stirs fear in his opponents because he represents a form of freedom none of them ever saw before, and they are bewildered about it, and frightened about it.

Norpoths model has correctly predicted the outcome of the popular vote for every election since 1996, including the 2000 race where Al Gore won the popular vote but George W. Bush took the presidency. It usually turns out that the candidate who does better in his partys primary beats the other guy who does less well, said Norpoth, adding that Trumps margin of victory in New Hampshire and South Carolina compared to Clinton (who lost in New Hampshire) was crucial to his model.

Proving he does, indeed, possess both a caustic wit and sharp political acumen, Putin just shut down the raging rigged elections controversy in what could best be called an epic prank to prove the point 〞 Russia requested, and was unsurprisingly denied, permission to monitor the U.S. presidential election. 
Think about it. This somewhat tongue-in-cheek offer, although likely made with the expectation of futility, makes several critical points on the true farcical nature of the American electoral process. 
State Department spokesman Mark Toner, cited by USA Today , dismissively condemned President Vladimir Putins suggestion as a PR stunt, and Meg Casper, spokeswoman for Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler, noted, Weve allowed observers from overseas in the past from other countries, never from Russia, adding both the FBI and Department of Homeland Security told us not to do this. 
But the swift rebuke from the U.S. aligns more with its unprecedented since the Cold War anti-Russia propaganda campaign 〞 a sensationalistic and proven fictitious narrative meant to inculcate Americans into believing Russia poses an imminent threat. 
In fact, with the Clinton campaign thoroughly capitalizing on the laughable narrative to warn Russia might attempt to rig the elections, and Donald Trump, rightly pointing to the former secretary of states efforts to rig the system from within and being accused of having ties to Putin, the State Departments rebuke seems more a hypocrisy-tinged joke. 
As USA Today reports, Toner noted that U.S. officials participated in a similar observation mission for Russias parliamentary elections in September. 
How the U.S. State Department expects anyone to ignore this blatant moral duplicity 〞 Its Perfectly Acceptable When We Do It, But Not For Someone We Dont Like 〞 was not made immediately clear.

They cannot provide for the needs and well being of the people, guarantee them peace, nor act in effective concert to stop and reverse the rapid global warming that these have economies created and which will utterly destroy civilisation in our lifetime. The crisis in capitalism has been evident for a century and resulted in two world wars and threatens a third. The remaining socialist countries that provide another model of economic development and another view of humanity cannot reach their potential as they are surrounded by an international system of capital that cannot tolerate any interference in its search for profit and aggressively undermines and attacks peoples who have chosen the socialist path. We have seen what the socialist republics in the USSR had to suffer when they succeeded. Only a return to a mixed economy, a revival of some state industries, and the defeat of the gangsters that first appeared as the representatives of capital have improved conditions for the people of those republics, in particular Russia. The new Russian state still holds onto some of the principles, the hopes for international law and sovereignty of nations and peoples, that were a defining characteristic of the Soviet Union. It still believes that the worlds peoples are all one and should live in cooperation with each other. The Communist Party and other left parties are still strong and have an influence among the people and the government. The lingering legacy of the socialist epoch has produced a leadership that seems, at least in comparison to those in other capitalist countries, rational and even, in some ways, enlightened. But still, Russia is also now part of the capitalist international and subject to its laws. So are the people of the United States and the other NATO countries. Those laws are cruel and criminal. They stipulate that to make more profit working people have to be paid less, for profit does not come out of thin air as western economists would have it; it comes from the value added to products by labour power that is forced from workers without compensation. In other words, the profit is ours but they take it. This fact dictates that the only way in which President-elect Trump can bring back jobs to America is to lower wages to the level that we now see in China, or worse Africa where workers are paid about a dollar a day. American companies moved their production out of the US and Canada with free trade to cheap labour markets to increase their profit. They are not going to return to the USA just because Donald Trump promised the people that they will. To return and pay higher wages, even those which are relatively low by the standards of the 50s and 60s, is to return and lose money. If Trump is serious about creating jobs then the only way he can succeed is to force the cost of labour down, that is reduce wages. We can expect more attacks on unions and union organising, a freeze or a lowering of the minimum wage, an influx of more cheap labour from Mexico and other countries. His promise to build a wall along the Mexican border is a lot of hot air, for to build it will raise the cost of business. Too many small industries and services in the US depend on this cheap labour and its presence depresses wages for the rest. We have seen this happen across the western world since the capitalists seized power in the USSR. As soon as that occurred every western country began the roll back of all the gains that working people had achieved after the Second World War. This roll-back, this rapid lowering of the standard of living of the mass of the people, in every country, followed by recessions, overproduction and more war as they fight for resources, using our money and bodies, is accelerating. The rise of the far right parties in Europe and the United States reflects this decline in the lives of the majority. Since the mass media has effectively convinced too many that the socialist path has failed, or as in the United States, cannot even be considered, people seek a remedy with the right-wing populist demagogues who promise them a chicken in every pot and peace in our time. We have seen where this leads; to nationalism and to war and these are always accompanied by xenophobia, racism, and other scapegoating techniques to divert attention from the root causes of the situation and create the atmosphere for war. Those who hope for better relations between Russia and the United States have the right to hope, but the international situation has not changed overnight. The United States still seeks to dominate the world, and Trumps promise to make America great again in contrast to Clintons America is great bragging, reflects the struggle inside the United States between those who think it can still succeed in dominating the world with its current structure and resources and those who have decided that a transformation has to take place for the United States to stay top dog in the world. The internal struggle in the United States has been a bitter one and it still is not settled which faction of the ruling elite will assume the power needed to make such a transformation possible. But the only people to benefit from that struggle, a struggle in which the people are and will be used as pawns to support one faction or the other, will be the already powerful and the already wealthy. The mass of the people will be the playthings of people in dark shadows and will turn on each other before they expose those shadows to the light. The American election was not about left or right, for there is no effective, organised left in that country. There are only degrees of the right. It was not about making lives better for its people. A large section of the voting population did not vote for there was nothing for them to vote for. The remainder took part in the theatre, played their part, few understanding the role they played and are still playing. The world stands on edge, wondering if we have been saved from the corrupt, venal war-monger that is Clinton or shackled with another corrupt nationalist reactionary in Trump, who will send us all down the same violent path. But, of course, both are true. For the world crisis continues and can only continue when leaders use terrorism to play upon the peoples weaknesses and fears, when the peoples doubts are used against them, when a man like Trump wears a mask of peace for one sucker and then is just a businessman for another, a straight talker, misunderstood; who knows how to get to this man with his wallet, this woman with her hatred for her boss, this one through ignorance and that one through the bribe, while offering everything because the offerings cheap, but who works for those satisfied with nothing less than making the world their personal domain. In reality the world stands on edge because the dominant ideology in the west offers no solutions to the crisis because it is itself the crisis. Capital cannot rule for the benefit of the people. It does not matter what brand of capitalism they are selling. It produces for profit not for need. The only way out of this crisis is for working people to start to once again sit down with each other and discuss what the cause of their problems is, and what needs to be done to change that. In Europe, and Latin America, Asia, and Africa, the left has a rich and proud history that most have not forgotten and so, perhaps, we can hope they will push back against the forces of the right that are being drawn out of the mud to fool and oppress the people. But in the United States where the left is weak and in disarray and the far right is rising without effective opposition, the situation is very bleak, for the American election did not resolve the crisis but only increased it; and in reaction I can only repeat what the great American poet, Stephen Vincent Benet, once wrote, Life have mercy on us.

The world is suddenly in disarray, in panic. A man notorious for his bigoted rhetoric, a man who believes in American exceptionalism, who wants to build the walls and to ＆restore order, has been elected the 45 th President of the mightiest nation on Earth. His nation is doubtlessly in decline; it is indebted and some would even argue, hopelessly bankrupt, but it is still the Empire, the sole one to this day. Below the surface, Mr. Trump may not be any viler than the Democratic candidate Mrs. Clinton and her clan has been for years. The establishment with which she has been inseparably intertwined for years and decades has been murdering millions all over the world, looting entire continents, and brutally guaranteeing that the Western world would always stay firmly in control of the entire Planet. Throughout the years, Mrs. Clinton has been using ＆politically correct rhetoric, mainly (and often in a twisted way) in order to silence those who dared to criticize her deeds. Still, no matter what her words were stating, millions of people have been vanishing, worldwide, as a result of the policies introduced by her and by her former boss, President Barack Obama. Donald Trump is brusque, aggressive, narcissistic and most likely, brutally honest. What he says is often pure trash, but whatever it is, he is not embarrassed to parade it in public. He has been giving many advanced warnings to both his supporters (including his voters) and to his adversaries. Objectively speaking, he is not any more or any less dangerous than Mrs. Clinton. Both candidates come from the moneyed, pro-establishment milieu. Yet Mr. Trump evokes much greater fear all over the world than his rival, from Asia and Africa to Latin America. It is at least partially because the mainstream Western propaganda rallied determinedly behind the well-tested and ＆reliable Mrs. Clinton (she has proven to be subservient to the Western imperialist regime and to market fundamentalist dogmas), and the Western mainstream media is exactly what is giving ＆marching orders to the local press, particularly in ＆client states in all parts of the world. * Nonetheless, Mr. Trump is definitely frightening on his own account, and just because he ran against (and defeated) the establishment candidate, does not make him less so. Rowan Wolf, Managing Editor at The Greanville Post and publisher of Uncommon Thought , recently summarized what I felt about the recent elections, when she wrote to me (it was right after the results were announced):  I am frightened over the election of Trump. Things were going to be bad here even without that because his position as the candidate for president legitimated the ugliest bigotry and violence. His election, legitimates and institutionalizes it at the highest levels possible. It is not as if this ugliness was not present in the US as it certainly was, but it was not celebrated. His racism extends outside the US and he has already stated numerous times that he would use nukes in the Middle East and just take the oil. He also hates the Earth. He plans to reverse or remove all environmental protections and regulations, and he doesnt believe in global warming. His presidency could not happen at a worse time for our planet. * I had the extremely bad fortune of spending ＆the day after in the den of the Western pro-establishment mainstream media based in Asia Pacific  the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand (FCCT). Or perhaps it was not only ＆bad fortune but also some type of perverse desire to witness the great and genuine desperation of those who have, for years and decades, been serving the Empire and its ＆liberal dogmas, twisting the truth and manufacturing hyper-reality. Even before my arrival at the FCCT, the results of elections were finalized. I expected a great mess, and mess it was. I witnessed depressed glances, nervous laughter, small talk, and an excessive consumption of booze. Speeches soon followed: made by the members of Western human rights organizations, of several NGOs, and press corps. Some Iranian exile began trashing Iran, somehow loosely connecting it to the US elections. Someone else had a go at the Philippines anti-imperialist President Duterte. And of course, China was hit on several occasions, and so was Russia, particularly that ＆evil Putin. One after another, speakers mimicked Ms. Clintons derogatory pronunciation of Russian Presidents name. No one mentioned Thailand or Indonesia even once. It was all grotesque and endlessly sad. Then the chest beating and insulting the voters slowly began＃ a slow masochistic public orgy. In the end, several well-behaved members of the public began queuing in front of the microphone, asking polite questions. Not sending the panelists to hell, not insulting them directly to their faces＃ Nothing like that! People were just asking non-confrontational questions, and then, patiently and politely waiting for replies. The ＆client states of the West were still very far from the rebellion. * Then my phone became extremely active, as I began receiving messages from all corners of the globe. From Sudan: I never thought Donald would win! The Sudanese are making fun of Trump saying that he looks like our President Al-Basheer. From Italy: Better than Killary, but still disgusting. From Uganda: Our government is acting as if it didnt back Hillary before the elections. From Argentina: Now in the US they will have to eat their own crap＃ as they made others eat it for decades. From Indonesia: Trump said that he would increase tariffs on imported products. In that case hell have to pay more for his suits, as he apparently wears some that are made in Indonesia. * Where were you on the 9-11? Or now: Where were you on 11-8? Some people compare these two events. On both occasions (or before), no one bothered to listen, to face reality, and as a result, some terrible events took place. On 11-8 I was in Bangkok. On 9-11 in Hanoi, Vietnam, sipping coffee, and looking out of my window. The apartment was on a higher floor of the Hanoi Tower. The building was literally growing out from the old French prison, where Vietnamese patriots used to be tortured, raped and executed by the French colonialists. If I were to walk all the way towards the very glass panel, I would be able to see, far below, two shiny guillotines, preserved for people to remember the ＆great enlightened rule of the West over Asia. Suddenly on the horizon, the sky lit up in a tremendous explosion of colors. The villages surrounding Hanoi were shooting firecrackers and makeshift rockets up to the sky. It was a great fireworks display, something I had never seen before. I turned my television set on. On the BBC coverage, two airplanes were flying, in slow motion, towards the towers of the World Trade Center. A few minutes later I received a phone call from my best friend in Santiago de Chile. You would not believe what is happening here, he reported to me, breathless. People, total strangers, are stopping here, in the middle of the street. They are crying, falling into each others arms, and whispering: Justice takes time, but it always comes! They were referring to 9-11-1973, when the United States overthrew one of the oldest and greatest democracies on Earth. Chile was raped, its people murdered, its form of government and its economic model were shattered. A few hours after the event, both the Vietnamese and Chilean governments expressed their shock and support for the American people. In Vietnam, the celebrations were not reported. But they took place. Everyone knew it. The great anger against the Empire could be felt, and is still felt, not only in those two great nations, but also all over the world. People are outraged. Those in the United States are＃ and also those in the rest of the world are＃ although they are outraged for totally different reasons＃ but outraged they all are nevertheless! Democracy is the rule of people. It does not mean the ＆Western multi-party system. It only means the ＆rule of the people, in Greek. It can be based on the ancient ＆heavenly mandate on which the Chinese system is based even now. It can be the modern Latin American form of participatory democracy＃ as long as people are ruling. However, they are not ruling. Not in the West, nor in most of the countries of the rest of the world, where the governments are forced upon them by Western imperialism to defend their states and to often adopt very tough measures to do so. People in the United States had spoken, expressing their frustration and anger. People in the rest of the world were not asked who should be leading the world. The next, the most logical step for the world should now be, immediately to reject the leadership of both the United States and Europe. Brexit and 11-8 should be followed by the WORLD-EXIT. What does it mean? Simple: ＆Let the West eat its own shit, alone, finally! And let the world be free from those governments and economic and colonialist concepts, which no one here (in Asia, Africa, Latin America or the Middle East) really elected and wants! Once we are at exiting, rejecting and defending, lets also build huge protective walls around all non-Western countries. To defend them from the Crusaders and hordes that have been looting and plundering the entire Planet for centuries. The citizens of the United States have spoken. Oh yes! So let the rest of the world do the same! Let them vote on WORLD EXIT! It is clear what the result will be!

This is a really rather short period considering that the position of the current political regime of the Cambodian Peoples Party (CPP) remains in doubt. Despite the Partys success at the municipal elections in 2015, there is no confidence that it may win and retain power at the parliamentary elections. The CPP is overloaded with a host of problems. Primarily, everyone is talking about corruption in the party, its nepotism, detachment from the people, who analysts state have long tired of seeing one and the same governing figures at the top of Cambodias political hierarchy. There is even the feeling that the leadership of the Party wont plan to renew its policy and introduce new leaders even if it recognizes its problems. In January 2015, at an emergency session of the CPP, it was noted that the corruption, nepotism, abuse of powers, violation of the laws spread among the Partys members had undermined the confidence of the people and raised doubts about its right to rule the country. The introduction of reforms inside the Party and society was named as a life-and-death issue for the CPPs future at the session. However, almost two years have passed since the session and the Party has not even started to solve its acute problems. There are no new young and attractive leaders in its leadership, yet the provincial level has rather competent and authoritative governors of provinces  CPP members that might change the image of the ruling party if they became members of its leadership. Despite the fact that the number of members of the Central Committee has doubled, it is still dominated by the same veterans of the Peoples Revolutionary Party who together with Hun Sen and supported by Vietnam and the Soviet Union built the Peoples Republic of Kampuchea (1979-1991). Over this period, they went from being comrade to Mr and became even more detached from real life. The style of the political leadership was supposed to be corrected, and the session would promote steps aimed at a symbolic detachment from the personal leadership of Hun Sen. These expectations were not met. Soon after the session, he took up the position of CPP Chairman and consolidated both administrative and party powers into his own hands. The relations of the authorities and the opposition have been developing in a complicated and ambiguous way. At first, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) headed by openly pro-Western and anti-Vietnam policy maker Sam Rainsy, which obtained only 12 seats fewer than the ruling party at the elections in 2013, boycotted the National Parliament in protest against the alleged falsification of the figures and violations that prevented their victory. Then, pro-Western nationalists agreed with Hun Sen to return to the Parliament and started active work aimed at spreading their influence in the rural areas by opening its branches in the traditional CPP territories and carrying out protests in their interest. This activity led by the opposition clearly frightened the ruling regime and Sam Rainsy emigrated while the other leader Kim Socha and his supporters were brought to justice for the organization of illegal anti-governmental protests. At the same time, Cambodias leader initiated propaganda attacks on the opposition leaders, organised protests demanding the resignation of its representatives from public offices. A number of opposition members were even beaten, which was followed by the initiation of criminal cases against them. The situation became so serious that the Deputies of the European Parliament threatened the authorities of Cambodia with suspending the provision of economic assistance. This is a serious warning for Hun Sen, as the European Union is one of the leading donors to Cambodias economy. As for the tactics of the opposition, it is now refraining from mass protest campaigns in order not to give the authorities reason to expand repressions. At the same time, using non-commercial organisations related to it and gaining Western subsidies, the opposition is generating the conviction in society that the ruling regime is against the people, and its leaders should be judged and their property should be confiscated. It also proposes a social and economic program that presupposes an increase in the minimum wage and retirement benefits, and a reduction in fuel and electricity prices. Though the program is purely populist and unreal, it is attracting people who have started to perceive the CNRP as a political force able to change the situation in the country. While assessing the situation in Cambodia and its prospects, it becomes clear that the Peoples Party has no clear pre-election strategy and it is not mobilizing party members for successful elections. The elaboration and presentation of a pre-election strategy might influence those who have doubts about their preferences and those who have not decided how to vote in 2018. In September, I had a chance to talk with the delegation from Cambodia at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. I was interested in the mood in the Peoples Party in the run-up to the elections.

As the world awaits the outcome of the election in the United States, buckle up for some rough times. 
James Turk: Everybody who I speak with here in London, Eric, asks me about the US election. Ive never seen anything like the amount of interest it has sparked. Without any doubt the election has grabbed the attention of people from around the world＃ Sponsored 
An attorney friend I was speaking to the other day called it a remarkable event. I said it had become more like a spectacle than an event. There have been so many twists and turns, it is hard to keep track of all of them. But the stock market seems to relaying a consistent message. 
The S&P dropped 9 consecutive days after the FBI announced it had found more Clinton emails, and that it was re-opening its investigation. Today the stock market is soaring as a result of the FBIs announcement this weekend that there was nothing new in this latest bundle of emails. 
Of course, no one really knows what, if any, the impact has been or will be on the final counting of the votes. I dont rely on the polls, as the mainstream media seems to use them more for massaging public opinion than to offer an unbiased result. 
The Brexit Surprise And the record of polls is poor in any case. Just a few months ago the polls here in the UK said Brexit would be voted down. 
Normally I do rely on the forecasting ability of the stock market for many things. But not this time. The stock market does not reflect the majority of Americans, most of whom do not own stocks. 
It is pretty clear what the stock market is saying. A Clinton victory will be good for stocks, and that a Trump victory would be bad for stocks. But the real situation is not likely to reflect such a simple theory. 
There are just too many unpredictable factors. Nevertheless, we do need to be thinking about what happens after the election, regardless of the outcome. 
In this regard, we have to recognize that there is no magic wand that will solve the countrys problems just because there is a new president, which explains in part why I remain so bullish on the precious metals. 
In 1913 A Monster Was Created Ever since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, the dollars purchasing power has been headed downhill. There are of course occasional upward bounces along this downward path, some of which last for months or even years. But slowly and surely the purchasing power of the dollar is being eroded away. 
Importantly, that decline of the dollar is not likely to change regardless who gets elected. So how does one protect their wealth from this ongoing debasement of the dollar? 
This answer is simple. Own tangible things that are useful. Dont rely on financial assets that are based on promises. In other words, the strategy to protect your wealth  your purchasing power  is to own tangible assets and avoid financial assets. So own things like gold, silver, farmland, mines and other tangible assets of value. Avoid assets like bank deposits, T-bills and bonds. And buckle up for some rough sailing ahead, regardless who wins.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has made history this year by becoming the first woman nominated to run for president by a major party. In less than two weeks, we will likely be celebrating our first female president. 
Hillary Clinton picked a beautiful place to plan to spend election night; the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York. 
She will break a metaphorical glass ceiling under a real glass ceiling when that special moment happens. About the building : The structure is an 840,000 square foot venue that sits on the Hudson River and has hosted numerous events. Its most striking aspect is that most of it is made of glass. 
More about the building : Operated by the New York Convention Center Operation Corporation (NYCCOC), a public benefit corporation, the Javits Center helps drive the economies of New York State and New York City, generating an impressive $1.5 billion in economic activity and supporting 14,000 jobs. Nowhere in the country will you find a more sought-after, state-of-the-art facility〞one with the extensive resources, services and staff of elite professionals dedicated to making every trade show, convention and special event a success.

〞 Elliot Smilowitz (@SmiloTweets) October 26, 2016 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has a connection to this building. He wanted to build it, but the city ended up overseeing the project, so he decided it was just a terrible project altogether. What a sore loser. 
Explained in Trumps book, The Art of the Deal , he said : What happened at that convention center is that the city and state took a great piece of property and a great project and ruined it through terrible planning and ridiculous cost overruns. 
The GOP is not as optimistic as Clinton is. In fact, the Michigan GOP has decided to cancel the election night rally they were going to have. 
Michigan GOP communications director Sarah Anderson said : It is a costly endeavor and we are using all available resources to elect Republicans.

Election officials in Louisiana seized a voting machine on Wednesday thats purpose was to serve VIP voters so that they could skip voting lines, an illegal and suspicious tactic by the longtime Jeffrey Parish Registrar Of Voters, Dennis DiMarco. 
The unique voter machine was kept in a conference room and only allowed special citizens to use it. Allegedly it was meant for the purpose of allowing citizens such as police officers, fireman, emergency physicians, and anyone else with a job that may keep them from being available during voting hours. 
Meg Casper, a spokeswoman for Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedlers office, told the Huffington Post that the machine was seized immediately and the users names have been retrieved. Schedler wrote a letter to DiMarco stating : I feel this action is necessary to preserve the transparency and integrity of early voting and to promote confidence within the general public regarding the voting process. 
Louisiana state law says that : Each voting machine shall be placed inside the polling place and shall be in full view of the public from the time the election begins until the last elector has voted. The commissioners and watchers shall be stationed near the voting machines, and the commissioners shall regulate the admission of the voters thereto, and each shall always be in full view of the other election commissioners and watchers and, as far as possible, of the public. 
Apparently the Registrar of Voters, DiMarco, wasnt aware of his own laws and replied with a statement saying: 
There was no fraudulent votes; theyre no allegations about that. No allegations of anyone voting who was not entitled to vote. Now, weve turned down everybody. So no one gets preferential treatment. But again, that means that those firemen, those policemen, are standing up rather than maybe doing their duty on the streets. 
If Louisiana requires every police officer, firemen, and other emergency personnel to work every day all day long then maybe we should be taking a look at that instead of refusing to acknowledge the law. 
Or maybe the Republican party should stop pushing so hard for limited early voting hours after fanning the flames of Republican presidential nominees unfounded claims that the election is rigged. Featured Image Via Gambit About Stephanie Kuklish

We have all heard Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump whining about voter fraud. He has been repeating the idea to his followers, encouraging them to go to the polls to watch out for the rigged election . 
Naturally, Trump and his minions are warning that the election is being stolen from him. His accusations imply that Democrats are stealing votes from Republicans. 
Election officials in all of the key states, many of whom are Republicans themselves, have assured the candidate that the election is not in fact rigged. 
Now, however, we have some actual proof of voter fraud. 
The Miami Herald reports that a 74 year old Florida woman has been arrested in Miami Dade county, after witnesses noted that she was marking ballots. The woman, Gladys Coego, was a temporary worker hired by the county elections office. She was supposed to be opening ballots that had been mailed in to the office. 
Her job was to simply check for any paper tears. Instead, in violation of the law, she looked for ballots that had not been marked for the mayoral vote. On those ballots, she marked the name of Republican candidate Raquel Regalado. 
At least one coworker saw her marking those ballots before turning them in, and reported her actions to supervisors. 
A supervisor then observed her using a pen that shed snuck into the office to mark the ballots. Having been caught by the boss, Coego admitted what she had done. No reason was given, and there are no known ties between Coego and the Regalado campaign. 
Ms. Coego turned herself in to the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. It is expected that she will be charged with two counts of felony for illegally marking other peoples ballots. 
There are only two counts because only two of the ballots were definitely changed by Ms. Coego. Authorities do think, though, that more ballots were affected, based on what her coworkers observed. 
So why did this older lady run the risk of changing the marks on official ballots? 
Why, because she really wanted the Republican candidate for mayor to win, thats why. Although she herself is registered without a party affiliation, the votes that she changed were in favor of the Republican Regalado. 
So. It still looks like the Trump campaign is dead wrong when it claims there is widespread voter fraud going on. And it looks like theyre wrong about which side is cheating, too. 
I swear. You cant make this stuff up.

For weeks,   nominee Donald Trump has been whining that the election is being rigged against him. He even called the presidential debates rigged. 
Now, I guess his ego is so YUGE because he wants the election cancelled, and the presidency awarded to him without voting. 
He said at a rally in Toledo, Ohio Thursday: And just thinking to myself right now, we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right? What are we even having it for? What are we having it for? ＆Her policies are so bad. Boy, do we have a big difference. 
Hes against voter fraud, but hes OK with just yanking the election away from us? That is insane. That is not how a democratic election works, Trumpy. Taking the vote away from the people like that would make Trump our first dictator. 
Trump may have been trying to make a joke out of it, but with his talk of rigged elections, that comment is just plain scary. 
On Thursday, Trump appeared on Bill O Reillys show. When asked if the polls would be rigged on election day, Trump said he believes they will be. When asked about his trailing in the national polls, Trump said : Im winning in certain polls and then in other polls, the dirty polls we call them, I was losing by numbers that were ridiculous. I think were winning, but Bill, you look at some of these polls its absolutely ridiculous. 
Just last week, Trumps poor Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway was faced with the undesirable job of defending Trumps idiocy. After one of the other times he whined about the election being rigged, she said : His entire campaign is built about the little guy being the victim, the forgotten man and forgotten woman being the victim of the rigged corrupt system. Lets keep the focus there. Thats who hes fighting for. I know so many in the media like to just dismiss the crowd sizes. Let me tell you something, you go out on the road with Donald Trump, this election doesnt feel over. 
When he refers to himself in the third person, it makes him sound even creepier.

Since it first became clear that this years nominees for their respective parties would be Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, theres been some whining among voters that they are being forced to choose between the lesser of two evils. And for those people, Real Time host Bill Maher has a very simple but direct message : Grow the fu*k up! 
On his show last night, Maher directly confronted the less of two evils griping by explaining whats at stake in this election: Republicans have one path to this election and its ＆false equivalency. They cant deny Trump is horrible  its on tape. So they want voters to believe that Hillary is just as bad. And in pursuit of that goal they have a very powerful ally 〞 lazy people. People who like to say, ＆theyre all bad. Because when you say that, you dont have to do any homework. Say, ＆theyre all the same, and you can sound justifiably jaded by the entire process when, really, you just dont know anything. 
Finally, Maher directed his comments at millennial voters who he said are wrongly obsessed with bullshit trivia: I am so tired of hearing that Hillary doesnt seem genuine. Grow the fuck up. 
Exactly! Hillary isnt genuine? So would you rather have a man who is a genuine serial sexual assaulter of women and a threat to the national and economic security of the United States? Those of us who care about what happens in the future because we love our children need to put aside our petty picking at a woman who has devoted her life to helping others and elect her as President. If we fail to do so, future generations will never forgive us.

By now, everyone on planet earth has heard about the bombshell news just announced by the FBI that it was re-opening its investigation into Hillary Clintons private email server. Heres the text of FBI head James Comeys letter to Congressional leaders. 
Obviously, lots of people are out there pontificating on what, if anything, this means. As such, Im going to add my two cents to the conversation. 
Ive prided myself on unemotionally calling this election how I see it the whole time, because Im neither a Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump supporter. Being free of the tremendous baggage that comes with cheerleading a particular candidate in this contentious election, I had consistently predicted a Trump victory until the Access Hollywood tape emerged. At that point I penned a thought-piece titled, Donald Trump is in Trouble  Part 2 , in which I changed my forecast to a Hillary Clinton victory. 
Heres some of what I wrote: 
After watching yesterdays audio and reading through the Wikileaks revelations, my prediction has changed for the first time this election. All things equal from here on out (meaning no additional huge revelations against Hillary), I think Hillary Clinton will defeat Donald Trump. I dont think its going to be a landslide, but I think shes probably going to win. The audio was very harmful for Donald Trump, and now Im going to explain why. 
First of all, if you want to accurately forecast the outcome of this election you need to get into the minds of the masses. Just like trading financial markets, what you think is right doesnt matter. What matters is what everyone else collectively thinks, and whether or not theyre going to get off their asses and vote. A big part of why I thought Trump would win related to the fact that I believe many people were simply looking for an excuse to vote for him. Justified disgust with the status quo in general, and Hillary Clinton in particular, pushed millions of Americans into the camp of being willing to take a gamble on Trump despite disliking him personally and disagreeing with him on many issues. I felt strongly that there were millions upon millions of Americans you could place into this category 〞 people who were flirting with the idea of voting Trump. I believe a significant amount of these people will not vote for him as a result of the audio. Will it be the majority of them? Probably not, but it will be a material number and arguably enough to swing the election. No, I dont think these voters will shift to Hillary, and no, I dont think committed Trump voters will change their minds. However, I do think enough of these willing to be convinced, leaning-Trump types will now stay home or vote third party. Its these voters who I expected to swing the election in Trumps favor, and they are now unreliable. 
Does Trumps vulgarity excuse the incalculable crimes of Hillary Clinton and her husband, making them preferable in this election? No it doesnt, but thats not the point of this article. Most voters are too superficial, too busy trying to survive and too uninformed to weigh all the very important issues rationally. As an example, think about how most conversations are going to go down this weekend. Lets say youre out with a bunch of friends for drinks tonight. Someone says, so have you seen the Trump audio? If someone in the group hasnt, someone will pull out their phone and itll be watched in 3 minutes. What if someone then says, yeah, but have you seen the leaked Hillary emails? What will your response be? You cant adequately explain the importance of that to your friends in 3 minutes. Instead, youll have to send them a lengthy article that theyll never read. So by the end of this weekend, pretty much everyone in America will have heard the Trump audio, while maybe 10% will take the time to analyze what came out of Wikileaks. There goes your election. 
Understanding the craziness of the election, I finished the piece with the following. 
Despite all of that, I still cant say with certainty that Hillary will win. However, I do think the landscape has changed enough, that for the first time this entire election season, I am no longer confident of a Trump victory. Then again, I was absolutely convinced that Hillary was unelectable after she collapsed on 9/11 and mislead everyone about her health, and I was wrong about that. Thats how completely crazy this election is, and theres still a month to go. Anything can happen, particularly with the debate coming up this Sunday. So while its certainly not out of the question, there will have to be some very material events over the next month to put Trump back in the drivers seat. 
While the Wikileaks emails have been an important factor in keeping this race close, I didnt think they were sufficient to alter my forecast of a Clinton victory. I think the reopening of the FBI investigation is enough of a black swan to materially change the course of this race. 
Clinton supporters will read this and think Im insane. They will think this because they are anticipating a landslide victory for Hillary. I never expected a landslide, so I think this news tips the election into a total tossup situation. My reasoning for the change is the same that led me to switch my forecast to Hillary after the Access Hollywood video was released. The primary reason I initially thought Trump would win related to the fact I believed enough people would be willing to vote for a person they dont really like in order to blow up the status quo. I felt that the video recording of Trumps vulgar commentary was enough to put those people into the absentee or third party column, despite millions of Americans looking for an excuse to vote for Trump due to the well understood awfulness of Hillary. This has changed, and voters now have the excuse they needed to vote Trump. 
That reason is simple. The problems with Hillary Clinton will never go away. They will always resurface or new problems will emerge, and it has nothing to do with a vast rightwing conspiracy (or Putin). It has to do with her. It has to do with the fact that her and her husband are career crooks, warmongers, and shameless looters of the American public. This re-opening of the FBI investigation just hammers all of that home for everyone. We know what 4 years of Hillary will look like. Itll be Obama cronyism on steroids, plus endless investigations with a side of World War 3. I dont think people want that, and so more Americans than the pundits realize will take a gamble on Trump. 
As a caveat, the above forecast assumes this new FBI investigation is not closed before November 8th. If it is, I think shell win. If not, I think Trump has even odds to win, if not better. 
Of course, with 11 days left in this crazy election, many more black swans could emerge. Stay tuned.

These are some pretty damning results for the mainstream media. Not only does the America public seen the media as a bigger threat to election results than Russian hackers, its not even close. 
The Washington Examiner reports: 
Voters fear the media far more than Russian hackers when it comes to tampering with election results. 
According to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll , 46 percent of likely voters believe the news media is the primary threat that might try to change the election results. 
The national political establishment was the second most-suspected group at 21 percent, and another 13 percent were undecided. 
Foreign interests, including Russian hackers, ranked fourth with 10 percent and local political bosses came in last with 9 percent of likely voters as the main threat to truthful election results.

Election 2016 has been extremely bittersweet for me. On the positive side, through both the Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump grassroots movements, we have seen clear proof that a huge number of Americans accurately understand that the current system is totally rigged and simply not working for them. These people didnt migrate toward these two candidates for some tweaks to the system here and there, their supporters want full scale paradigm level change. 
As such, rather than dwelling on the differences between these two populist movements, lets consider some of the areas where they overlap. 
1. Trade 〞 Opposition to NAFTA and current trade deals such as TPP, TTIP, and TISA have been central to both the Sanders and Trump campaigns. 
2. War and militarism 〞 Whether you believe Trump is sincere or not, opposition to Obama/Clinton interventionist overseas wars were key talking points for both Trump and Sanders. 
3. The system is rigged 〞 The painful acknowledgment that the U.S. economic system is a rigged scam that fails to reward hard work, and is more akin to a parasitic, predatory oligarchy with very limited social mobility, has been a key campaign theme for both Trump and Sanders. The economy is increasingly dominated by near-monoploy giants who relentlessly push for more power and more profits irrespective of the cost to society, whether that cost be war, poverty or social unrest. 
4. Money in politics 〞 The rigged economic system described above aggregates wealth into an increasingly small number of hands. Those hands then buy off politicians and rig the political process. A rigged economy and rigged political system perpetually feeds itself and endlessly grows at the expense of the public like a terminal cancer. Both Trump and Sanders emphasized this problem. 
5. Rule of law is dead 〞 Sanders focused on Wall Street bankers, while Trump focused on Hillary and her inner circle of cronies, but the overall point is the same. Rich and powerful oligarchs are above the law. We all know this, but Washington D.C. refuses to do anything about. 
Despite all of the above, the ultimate status quo candidate, Hillary Clinton, has a very good chance of winning tomorrows election. Why? Primarily because Donald Trump is a very divisive figure who focused too much on polarizing issues such as building a wall, stop-and-frisk, supporting torture, advocating for internet censorship and libel laws, etc. While he got his act together toward the end of the campaign, he spent far too much of it marginalizing people like me who desperately want to vanquish the status quo, but couldnt get comfortable with Trump. 
This is where the election took on a decidedly negative tone for me on a personal basis. Ive dedicated the last six years of my life to fully exposing and combating status quo corruption, but when the populist revolt finally arrived, the only choice I was given for change was one I couldnt embrace. For someone so passionately yearning for positive, paradigm-level change, thats been a crushing letdown. Personally, Ive passed the point where Im willing to vote for someone I dont believe in or trust. As such, I wont be voting for either one. That said, my individual vote is irrelevant, and I dont want to focus on that. The bigger question is, who do I think will win? 
On that question, I dont have a strong opinion at the moment. Ultimately, it depends on whether Americans go into the voting booth and see status quo vs. blowing up the status quo, or if they see Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton. If they see the former, odds are in Trumps favor. If they see the latter, its a matter of which personality Americans find least repulsive. 
So here we stand. Despite the fact that a huge percentage of Americans deem both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to be unelectable, one of them is about to be elected. As such, we really need to start thinking and strategizing about the future. In that regard, I propose we look at the five points of Sanders/Trump overlap I highlighted earlier. If we can stay focused on those existential issues after the election irrespective of who wins, we the people have a good chance of uniting a clear majority of the population and ultimately turning this national disaster around. 
Or we can allow ourselves to be divided and conquered into oblivion. The choice is ours.

One final set of thoughts before you go out to vote today. 
Theres one major issue that got very little play during the campaign, as the media was hell-bent on focusing on Trump and bad words. 
If we all burn, that is on them 〞 and you. But I assure you the press will fry up just like you will at 5,000 degrees. 
That issue is Syria. 
Hillary Clinton has committed herself to imposing a no fly zone over Syria. As I have pointed out on multiple occasions in this column there are two problems with that commitment. 
First, the Russians are in there at Syrias invitation. Theyre protecting Syrias government at its request, exactly as we protected Kuwait at its request . They are therefore acting with the permission of the sovereign government of Syria, and we will not be. We will effectively be invading Syria. 
Second, Russia has missile systems deployed in Syria that we cannot reliably kill, and our aircraft and other flying equipment cannot reliably survive being fired upon by them either. While we can certainly find some of their batteries through intelligence and similar, and blow them up, doing so would be a clear act of war. If we do not do so then anything Russia does not want flying in the skies over Syria will not be flying. It will instead be in many pieces and any airmen inside said aircraft will be dead. 
Will Russia allow us to dictate that there will be a no-fly zone and allow us to enforce it? 
I doubt it. 
If we attempt to implement one anyway then conflict is inevitable. This is a conflict that has not happened thus far in the nuclear age between superpowers. Oh sure, theres been a plane forced down here and one shot down there, along with plenty of harassment, along with various proxy wars where this party or that was supplying arms to one side or the other (e.g. Afghanistan) but an actual face-off and exchange between US and Russian forces has never occurred. 
Once it happens, if it does, then someone will of course believe they won and someone will believe they lost. The question will then be whether the side who believes it lost will admit to that and withdraw. 
If that side does not do so then we are facing nuclear war  a war that inherently involves the destruction of both nations infrastructure and large percentages of their respective populations. 
Hillary Clinton has said she intends to walk this path. We do not know whether Trump will; he hasnt committed himself one way or the other. But his statements thus far tend to lead me, and many others, to believe he wont try to interfere in Syrias (or anyone elses) sovereign affairs. In fact hes made clear that he believes that we have had far too many foreign entanglements and they have not served us well. 
Theres no guarantee that a President Trump would not find some reason to intervene, of course, and thus no guarantee that we dont ultimately wind up in the same place. Lets face it 〞 Syria is a mess, and one that Hillary Clinton had a large hand in creating. 
But the choice here is between someone who might get pressed into a situation that leads to armed conflict, possibly nuclear conflict, and someone who has a vested interest in continuing what she started, who has declared her intent to take an action that by definition will violate Syrias sovereignty and, with near-certainty will lead to an exchange of weapons between the Syrian protectors, which are Russian, and the United States. 
That road has a high probability of being one way and at the end are events you will not like. 
Dont vote to die 〞 and kill your children. 
If you vote for Hillary you are in fact voting for nuclear war.",english,2016-11-08T17:37:12.188+02:00,libertynews.com,US,,ELECTION DAY QUESTION: Do You Want To Glow In The Dark?,0,http://libertynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-08-at-9.19.28-AM.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

While many Americans and law enforcement agencies remain opposed to legalization of cannabis for various reasons, voters in multiple states passed ballot measures bringing pot closer to national acceptance.
Here is the breakdown:
Arkansas 
-Issue 6 passed legalizing the use of medicinal marijuana.
California 
-Proposition 64 passed by a wide margin and legalized the recreational use of marijuana. California previously allowed the use of medicinal marijuana.
Florida 
 Amendment 2 passed legalizing ＆physician-prescribed marijuana.
Massachusetts 
 Question 4 passed legalizing both medicinal marijuana and recreational marijuana for those at least 21 years of age.
Montana 
 Initiative 182 passed legalizing the use of medicinal marijuana.
Nevada 
 Question 2 passed legalizing the recreational use of marijuana ( one ounce or less ) by adults 21 and over.
North Dakota 
 Measure 5 passed legalizing the use of medicinal marijuana.
Currently, Question 1 in Maine has yet to be determined, it stands to legalize, regulate, and tax marijuana as an agricultural product.
Arizonas Proposition 205 failed and stood to legalize marijuana for individuals older than 21 years of age.

The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint Friday against FBI Director James Comey with the Department of Justice, alleging interference with the 2016 presidential election. 
The coalition, an arm of the Keep America Great PAC, filed the complaint with the DOJs Office of Professional Responsibility, after Comey announced to Congress that because of new emails discovered on Huma Abedins electronic devices relevant to the Hillary Clinton email investigation, the agency would review those emails and assess their relevancy to the investigation . 
For Scott Dworkin, senior advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, the announcement is evidence that Comey, a registered Republican, is attempting to undermine Clintons chances of taking the White House. 
In a statement, Dworkin submitted: 
It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election. It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton. 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump has filed numerous complaints with federal agencies about figures connected to the 2016 election. 
On Monday, the group filed a complaint with the FBI against Donald Trump himself for allegedly violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In other words, the group thinks Trump has called for voter intimidation and suppression on a national level. 
Earlier in October, the group also filed a complaint against the Trump campaign and political strategist Roger Stone, saying both were involved with WikiLeaks and also a foreign government behind the hacks that lead to the release of emails from John Podesta, Clintons campaign chair. 
Podesta referred to the FBIs Friday announcement as extraordinary. 
It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election, Podesta said . The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining. 
In July, after the FBI came to a conclusion on Clintons private email server and said that no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with criminal charges, the Clinton campaign praised Comey as a well-respected Republican who served as George W. Bushs Deputy Attorney General. 
Brian Fallon, press secretary for the Clinton campaign, shamed Republicans in September , particularly GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley , for trying to bully the FBI into serving partisan interests.

Whispers of payback are being directed at Hillary Clinton after she decried as unprecedented the surprise FBI revival of its probe of her email scandal. 
Thats because 24 years ago, as former President George H.W. Bush was surging back against challenger Bill Clinton, a special prosecutor raised new charges against Bush in the Iran-Contra probe, prompting Clinton to claim he was running against a culture of corruption. 
Many Republicans claimed that the indictment made by special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh against former Reagan-era Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger the weekend before the 1992 election cost Bush a second term. The indictment, later thrown out, challenged Bushs claim that he did not know about a controversial arms-for-hostages deal that dogged the Reagan-Bush administration. 
When it came, Clinton seized on it, saying for example, Secretary Weinbergers note clearly shows that President Bush has not been telling the truth when he says he was out of the loop.

This is the news everyone has been waiting. A Super Computer in India, which correctly predicted our ENTIRE Primary season, was just used to predict the results of the US Presidential election. 
The computer took into account more than 20 Million data points across the US, factoring in things most groups ignore like interaction of Facebook, Twitter, and Google, and came up with this as its final result＃ DONALD TRUMP WILL DEFINITELY WIN THE US ELECTION!! 
The Program, known as MoglA, was developed back in 2004 by an Indian developer named Sanjiv Rai. It has since been collecting Data and learning from every US election cycle, and has predicted every single trend since then. 
The news gets even better, though! As if it were not enough already that Trump is predicted to win, ＃He has also beat Barack Obamas peak engagement figures from back in 2008 by 25 Percent!!! 
Now that is something the Lamestream media does NOT want you to know about. 
So I say Nate Silver and all the other Hillary shill pollsters can suck it! The Super Computer has spoken, and the winner is Donald Trump. 
Now its up to us to get this shared out all across Facebook so the world sees that the Revolution is REAL!

Ever since early voting began, numerous reports are claiming that the electronic voting machines are rigged, as votes for Donald Trump are automatically switched to Hillary Clinton. Weve all begun to suspect that Hillary is behind the scam, and now, we have further proof that Democrats are the ones tampering with these machines as part of their intricate plan to steal the election. 
We recently reported how Hillarys evil billionaire funder George Soros owns the voting machines in 16 key states, which immediately set off warning bells nationwide. Disturbingly, the massive fraud taking place is not just confined to those 16 areas, as another crooked player in Hillarys election-stealing plot has just been revealed. 
In a bombshell just unearthed by independent researcher Micro Spooky Leaks , A Canadian company by the name of Dominion Voting provides the voting machines to 600 jurisdictions in 22 states and is directly linked to the Clinton Foundation as one of their massive donors. 
On their homepage, the company alludes to how they help rig elections, stating  we strive to change elections for the better! which is a chilling statement considering they supply 50% of the electronic voting machines on the U.S. voting market. 
Right after this startling information was revealed, however, it appears as though Democrats immediately began white-washing the information, as the link to the statement on the Wikipedia page that corroborated the bombshell information was mysteriously removed. 
Hillary has played dirty for years, and it appears as though her antics arent stopping now. After murdering many people close to exposing her scandals as a way to prevent them from ruining her presidential bid, the only thing left now is to steal the election through massive voter fraud. 
The picture at this point is becoming bleak. Theres no doubt that Donald Trump can defeat Hillary, as evidenced by his early lead in many historically blue states, and the recent bombshell that Hillarys lead across many polls is completely fake. 
However, fighting back against electronic voting machines that have been calibrated by Hillary operatives to switch votes from Republican to Democrat will be extremely difficult. The only thing we can do at this point is demand a paper ballot when we vote. Dominion Voting machines that will be used in 22 states 
We are coming down to the wire here. Every day, more information surfaces on Hillary and the Democrats crooked scheme to steal the election. Continue to share stories like this and help fight back and spread the information.

Astonishing, newly released leaked audio of Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has just surfaced, and what it reveals is damning. In her own voice, we hear the corrupt Democrat telling reporters that elections can and should be rigged to ensure who wins. This throws the validity of every government on earth in the shredder because she isnt only talking about rigging American presidential elections. 
Since the FBI reopened their investigation into the criminal Democrat and Hillary seeks a powerful position to dictate the lives of others, its important to hear this audio. She is blatant when she say elections shouldnt take place unless we make sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. 
Hear it from her own mouth: 
Hillary clearly said, I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.  
This conversation took place in 2006 during a discussion with Eli Chomsky, an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press. At the time, Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. 
Her trip, making the rounds of editorial boards, brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. Her conversation was secretly recorded, and the audio hasnt been released until now. 
According to Chomsky, this little audio clip has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. He claims his copy is the only copy and no one has heard it since 2006 〞 until now. Election rigging Democrat, Hillary Clinton 
It proves she is willing to do whatever it takes to win. With massive amounts of voter fraud already being reported in favor of the most criminal and corrupt politician of our time, in combination with this audio, its hard to deny that Hillary wouldnt rig the election to win. 
Luckily, Americans are wising up to her disturbing antics. We all saw her cheat during the debates , and the proof came out in leaked emails, thanks to WikiLeaks. 
Its important to hear this, coming directly from Hillary herself, and we can all tell that it is her voice. We all know shes rigging this election to beat Donald Trump, but she obviously has had her hands in rigged elections before. 
It is hard to say how many elections across the globe she has influenced or just stolen. Hillary Clinton will stop at nothing to grab even a small amount of power, and she continues to prove she is as corrupt as they come.",english,2016-10-30T23:39:08.593+02:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,BOMBSHELL: Hillary Clintons Leaked Audio Proves She Rigs Elections,0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/audiofeature.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson speaks during a campaign rally at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa. First it was Bernie Sanders. Now its Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein being sized up by many young people. With a day to go, Hillary Clinton has struggled to convince young voters that she deserves their support. 
AUSTIN, Texas 〞 Although some indicators suggest the 2016 presidential election could be closer than initially expected, prominent third-party candidates are urging voters not to waver in their support for options outside the traditional two-party system. 
Alternatives to the Democrat and Republican nominees, such as the Green Partys Dr. Jill Stein and former Gov. Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party, received unprecedented attention in this election cycle as dissatisfaction with the two major candidates soared to unprecedented highs. 
But third parties traditionally struggle to hold the publics interest as Election Day approaches , with many voters eventually falling in line with one of the two major parties. While some polls previously suggested a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton, others are now showing a tighter than expected race , which could also scare off some potential third-party voters. 
A RealClearPolitics analysis of polls which include all four candidates, which was last updated on Wednesday, suggested Johnson would net about 4.1 percent of the popular vote and Stein could get as much as 2.1 percent. 
If either candidate can net 5 percent of the popular vote on Nov. 8, theyll unlock up to $10 million in additional federal funding for future elections. That money could unleash more political power by enabling the Greens or Libertarians to reach more potential voters. 
While some polls indicate that Johnsons unprecedented support is fading in the eleventh hour before the election, Johnson tweeted on Thursday that his support was especially strong among voters who identify as independent.

〞 Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) November 1, 2016 
In a statement published recently on the Stein campaigns website, the Green Party nominee called it a bellwether year in which her candidacy reached new voters in new communities. Encouraging her supporters to push for 5 percent of the vote, Stein continued: As corporate, mainstream political pundits scoff at and attack my ＆unlikely candidacy, we have been traveling throughout the country, talking with people from all walks of life and organizing on the ground with a fast-growing base of support from ＆unlikely voters: millennials, indebted students, poor and working class people, immigrants, people of color, and many others who have given up on the two establishment parties out of disgust and frustration. 
Green Party backers have also used the hashtag #InvestYourVote on Twitter to encourage voters to take a long-term view of the potential effectiveness of voting for a third-party candidate: ""Fear of Donald Trump is not enough for me to support Clinton, with her record of corruption.""

On Oct. 31, Stein and Johnson faced off in a televised debate hosted by PBS Tavis Smiley, marking an unusually mainstream forum for the candidates. During the program, the pair reacted to the renewed FBI investigation into Clintons emails and other recent developments in this often stressful election . Watch  Dr. Jill Stein and Former Gov.

Another alternative candidate receiving an unusual level of attention in the lead-up to Election Day is Evan McMullin, an independent from Utah who formerly served as a CIA operative and as a policy advisor to Congress. Polls and electoral analysts have even suggested McMullin has a chance of winning an electoral vote in the state, where some members of the Church of Latter Day Saints see him as a conservative alternative to Republican candidate Donald Trump. 
On Oct. 29, one of McMullins tweets went viral after Trump told Fox News that hed never heard of McMullin and accused him of being a puppet of Bill Kristol, the neoconservative founding editor of The Weekly Standard. 
In a response which has been retweeted over 18,000 times, McMullin fired back: Yes youve never heard of me because while you were harassing women at beauty pageants, I was fighting terrorists abroad. . @realDonaldTrump , Yes youve never heard of me because while you were harassing women at beauty pageants, I was fighting terrorists abroad. https://t.co/hNDTWn3HPN

Unlike other vote swapping schemes which pair a voter in a swing state with a voter in a ＆safe state, a vote pact pairs voters across party lines who each promise to cast their ballots for a third-party candidate instead.   Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein, foreground, meets her supporters during a campaign stop at Humanist Hall in Oakland, Calif. on Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016. 
AUSTIN, Texas 〞 Third-party candidates are often accused of acting as spoilers by siphoning votes from the two major parties nominees and potentially tipping the balance in an election. 
Perhaps the most notable example of this is Ralph Nader. The former Green Party candidate is frequently accused of helping George W. Bush win the 2000 presidential election by diverting votes which otherwise would have gone to Democratic nominee Al Gore, although this theory has been disproven many times . 
A lot of people have basically grown to depend on the confines of the two-party system and have a hard time getting their brain around a constructive, strategic path out of it, Sam Husseini, a political activist, told MintPress News. 
Husseini proposed an alternative strategy in which voters form voting pacts across party lines. For example, a Democrat and a Republican might each agree to vote for a third-party candidate of their choice, rather than the two major parties candidates. The strategy reduces the potential for spoiling votes, as long as voting pacts dont cross state lines, because each of the major candidates loses voters equally. 
Husseini operates the website VotePact.org to encourage this method of vote sharing or vote pairing. Letter in Wash Post: VotePact Offers Voters a Sensible Alternative 〞 how #NeverTrump & #NeverHillary can pair up: https://t.co/HB3CtnGGdi 
〞 votepact (@votepact) August 30, 2016 
It has the potential for being a catalyst for genuine realignment and perhaps even for a victory for a so-called third party or independent candidate creative enough to use such a strategy, Husseini said. 
Third-party candidates frequently urge voters to follow their conscience rather opt for one of the lesser of two evils selected by the two-party system. As Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein frequently says , We need to stand up and fight for the greater good like our lives depend on it. 
Husseini said hed like to see third-party candidates embrace vote pacts instead of dismissing spoiler claims. He suggested they should also urge their supporters to form vote pacts as a way to safely support third-party movement building. Heres how Husseini imagines the idea being pitched by a candidate: Theres a way out of this. You feel like you gotta vote for Clinton because you hate Trump. I get that. Lots of people are like that and lots of people are on the other side. Well, they should pair up and both vote for me. 
He continued: Ive never seen any third-party candidate do that, which is why I think theyre going to remain in single digits in the popular vote. 
Other forms of vote swapping have been proposed during this and previous elections, usually seeking to pair a voter from a swing state with a voter from a state red or blue state. The voter in the so-called safe state agrees to vote for a third-party candidate in return for securing a vote for their preferred candidate in a state where the election is in play. 
This safe state strategy was especially popular in 2000, when voters sought to trade Nader and Gore votes. That election prompted a court case in which the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that that vote swapping is clearly protected by the First Amendment. 
Last month, Husseini told Bustles Ame Latour that the safe state strategy just kicks the can down the road. Third parties often hope to secure 5 percent of the popular vote in presidential races, which would unlock millions in additional federal funding for future elections, but Husseini thinks by embracing vote pacts they could potentially win elections outright. 
The other so-called ＆strategies are basically a way of minimizing the so-called ＆damage of third-party runs, he told MintPress. 
While Husseini said he hopes alternative candidates will someday make vote pacts a key part of their campaign strategy, he also stressed that it isnt too late for voters to embrace the idea in the 2016 election. Vote pacts require mutual trust between political opponents, so he recommends forming them with family members, close friends, and coworkers across party lines. 
He also said voting pacts could spur political change by encouraging people to engage in challenging political conversations across party lines rather than simply shutting out opposing views. 
Instead unfriending that guy who said he might vote for Trump because he hates Clinton, reach out to them.

Barbara Cegavske, the Nevada secretary of state, during a debate .The Republican Secretaries of State Committee, a fundraising group, invited her to participate by phone in May meetings with tobacco, restaurant and gun industry representatives to discuss ballot initiatives. 
The targeting of secretaries of state with campaign donations, corporate-funded weekend outings and secret meetings with industry lobbyists reflects an intense focus on often overlooked ballot questions, which the secretaries frequently help write. 
The ballot initiatives are meant to give voters a direct voice on policy issues such as the minimum wage and the environment. But corporate and other special interests are doing their best to build close ties with the secretaries because a difference of even a few words on a ballot measure can have an enormous impact on the outcome. 
The influence campaign has intensified, with more citizen-driven ballot initiatives to be decided on Election Day this year than at any time in the past decade. 
Secretaries of state from Washington, Ohio, Colorado and Nevada 2014 all Republicans 2014 participated in closed-door meetings in May with representatives from Reynolds American, the nations second-largest tobacco company ; the National Restaurant Association; and the National Rifle Association, while ballot initiative signatures in those states were still being collected, documents obtained through open records requests show . 
At a weekend retreat last month at a hunting lodge in Kansas, Republican secretaries of state mingled with donors, including a representative from Koch Industries, as they shot pheasant and clay pigeons. The owners of Koch Industries 2014 Charles G. and David H. Koch 2014 have funded groups involved in several ballot initiative fights this year, including over a solar energy measure in Florida. 
The Koch brothers out with the Republican secretaries of state 2014 thats a news story I dont need, Allen Richardson, a Koch lobbyist, joked, unaware that a reporter was in attendance. 
Groups aligned with Democrats have also targeted secretaries of state, mobilizing during the 2014 campaign to try to elect more officials sympathetic to their causes. 
With so many important issues being decided through ballot initiatives (increases in the minimum wage, gay marriage, environmental protections, etc.), increasing our involvement in electing secretaries of state who will stand with working families is vital, said a strategy memo co-written by Steve Rosenthal , a veteran political strategist for labor unions. 
The May meetings between industry officials and the Republican Secretaries of State Committee, a fundraising group, were set up to give the industry players a chance to weigh in on ballot initiatives that the secretaries were overseeing, emails show. 
In an email with the subject line  Ballot Initiative Private Meetings in DC,  Emily Keech, the committees executive director, invited Barbara Cegavske, the Nevada secretary of state, to join the sessions by phone, noting that the others were flying in. 
I know that the National Rifle Association has some concerns in NV so it would be helpful to get your insights, Keech wrote , referring to a Nevada initiative that would more broadly require background checks for gun sales, a measure opposed by the NRA. 
She assured Cegavske that the meetings would be kept confidential. 
I dont want that listed anywhere since it is a sensitive topic for some secretaries, Keech wrote in the email . In briefing papers she later sent, she detailed the ballot initiatives the industry groups were concerned with 2014 and just how much the groups had donated for Republican election efforts. 
Some former secretaries of state said the new fundraising tactics could hurt the image of the offices as impartial referees of state elections. 
It is extremely important that the public trust their elections and have confidence they are going to be handled in a fair and impartial way, said Sam Reed, a former Republican secretary of state in Washington. And ballot issues in particular are very sensitive. 
Twenty-six states allow citizens to enact or repeal laws through a popular vote. The initiative process began over a century ago as a way to circumvent state legislatures, considered at the time to be dominated by powerful corporate interests. 
There are 71 citizen initiatives this year, according to Ballotpedia , a nonprofit group that tracks state elections, and spending on those initiatives has reached at least $821 million . 
With billions at stake, major corporations routinely hire consulting firms to help them influence ballot initiatives. 
The key to any ballot measure is the right language, Nathan Sproul , the managing partner at Lincoln Strategy Group, whose client list has included Walmart, Philip Morris International and Wynn Resorts, told a roomful of lobbyists in September at a closed-door strategy session in Alexandria, Va. In Arizona, you write the concept, and then the secretary of state writes the language. 
Another Lincoln executive, Ulrico Izaguirre, told attendees, as he ran through a long list of Election Day items before voters this year: The clouds of ballot measures threaten business on a daily basis. Thunderous clouds. 
Republicans have turned to initiatives to push their agenda as a counter to liberal activists, according to an internal party memo. 
Ballot initiatives will not be the lefts mechanism for gaining power and advancing their agenda when voters have already rejected them, said the memo, from the Republican State Leadership Committee , in February 2015 as the group prepared fundraising efforts. Its time for conservatives to take back that power by rejecting their efforts and promoting our own. 
The Republican organization that hosted the closed-door meetings in Washington is an arm of the Republican State Leadership Committee, a political group dedicated to electing candidates to state government posts. 
In a July 2015 memo, the leadership group said , The diverse set of responsibilities held by Republican Secretaries across the country presents previously unidentified opportunities for significant growth and expansion, and then discussed the importance of ballot initiatives as a fundraising tool. 
And money has poured in. Reynolds American has contributed $990,000 in the past two years to the Republican State Leadership Committee, and Altria, the nations largest cigarette company , has given at least $540,000 2014 making them the second- and third-biggest donors to the organization, behind the United States Chamber of Commerce. The NRA has donated at least $160,000. 
Ellie Hockenbury, a spokeswoman for the Republican State Leadership Committee, said the meetings and other conversations with donors were simply informational. 
And secretaries of state said their efforts to raise money had no impact on their actions as government officials. 
When you are trying to raise money, you try to work with people who have an interest in the subjects, said Wayne Williams, the Colorado secretary of state. He added, I will meet with anybody on any side of the subject at any time. 
But Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the restaurant association, acknowledged that the organization, at its headquarters in Washington, had expressed concerns to the secretaries of state about the minimum-wage ballot initiatives. 
As a membership organization, the National Restaurant Association and our state partners meet with many different organizations on both sides of the aisle to voice the concerns, she said in a statement. 
Email records from Nevada show that the Republican fundraising efforts are linked to ballot initiatives. A spreadsheet obtained from Cegavske includes a contact list prepared by Keech, the Republican Secretaries of State Committees executive director. 
I would ask for $25k due to the gambling and gaming initiatives all across the country, Keech wrote to Cegavske , referring to Wynn Resorts, along with a list of other possible donors, and their ties to ballot initiative efforts. 
Another target for a solicitation was NV Energy, which is facing a proposed constitutional amendment, requiring voter approval, to end the companys monopoly over much of the states electricity market. 
Cegavskes executive assistant wrote back to Keech, reporting that the effort had generated some cash return. 
Barbara has contacted NV Energy and they are good for a contribution, the executive assistant, Jennifer Russell, wrote in April . 
What great news!!!! Keech wrote back. The Secretaries contacts are ALWAYS better than ours. 
In a statement, Cegavske said the suggestion that she had sought money from NV Energy because of the pending ballot initiative was categorically false. 
Democrats have also attracted large donations from labor unions and activists with an intense interest in ballot agenda items. Michael R. Bloomberg donated $250,000 this year to an Oregon candidate who as a state legislator had helped push through a law on background checks for gun sales. 
A spokesman for Bloomberg said the donation was not related to any effort to influence future ballot measures. 
Labor union and abortion rights groups, however, were more explicit. The confidential memo drafted by veteran labor union organizers before the 2014 election 2014 published last month by WikiLeaks as part of the cache of emails stolen from Hillary Clintons campaign chairman, John D. Podesta 2014 said those groups were prepared to support the effort. 
The office of Secretary of State is playing an increasingly important role for progressives, the memo said, noting its pivotal roles in the ballot initiative process. 
The impact of these donations and private gatherings on actions by secretaries of state is difficult to gauge, given the dozens of small language changes as the ballot measures are being prepared for Election Day. But there are hints of possible benefits. 
For example, a gun control initiative on the Nevada ballot next week was framed by the secretary of state as a measure that would prohibit firearm transfers without background checks, rather than as a required additional step before a gun sale could take place. 
This is a seemingly small but important difference that gun control supporters say makes the ballot item less palatable to voters. 
Cegavske said the ballot language she used fairly reflected text submitted to her office by those advocating the measure. 
There was no input from the gun industry in the writing of the ballot question, Gail J. Anderson, the deputy secretary for Southern Nevada, said in a statement. 
After a minimum-wage campaign accelerated last year in Ohio, emails show, Jon A. Husted, the secretary of state, communicated with an Ohio Chamber of Commerce affiliate as the business group discussed plans with the restaurant industry to meet and strategize about its opposition effort. 
A spokesman for Husted said that the amendment and referendum processes can be cumbersome and that the secretary is often asked to come explain precisely how it works. 
Minimum-wage advocates chastised Washingtons secretary of state, Kim Wyman , who is in the midst of a re-election campaign. She has benefited from a blitz of radio advertisements paid for by the Republican group that sponsored the May meetings with industry representatives. Wyman declined requests to comment. 
At the three-day hunt 2014 where corporate donors and secretaries of state from Kansas, Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas shared a one-story, wood-frame hunting lodge, with stuffed deer and elk antlers mounted on the walls 2014 there was little discussion of formal election matters. 
Instead, it was an opportunity for the corporate executives to cement personal connections. Together, they set loose Labrador retrievers on acres of prime high-grass hunting grounds, flushing pheasants and quail from their hiding spots. 
I was 60 yards away, Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, said as he showed off two prairie chickens he had shot earlier in the day. 
After a dinner of shredded beef, the state officials and political contributors, some in pajamas, drank beers. The only apparent disappointment the next morning, after their first hunting outing together as a group, was that they had bagged only 58 birds, two short of their legal limit. 
The two that got away, Kobach said. 
Well get em tomorrow, said one of the corporate executives.

〞 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2016 Crazy  Election officials saying that there is nothing stopping illegal immigrants from voting. This is very bad (unfair) for Republicans! 
〞 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2014 
However, Mark Crispin Miller, a self-described election integrity activist, dismissed Trumps claims. 
Its basically impossible to vote ten times or fifteen times, said the professor of media studies at New York University who has spent more than a decade studying election results. 
Under current electronic voting systems, its no longer really possible ＃ to get a bunch of immigrants out there to stuff the ballot box. With a computerized system, its extremely difficult for many people to vote even one time, much less ten or fifteen. 
Only a couple of incidents of voter fraud or vote tampering have been found during this election, including the case of an Iowa woman who was arrested after she tried to vote multiple times for Trump , but they were quickly noticed by authorities. 
Republicans commit that crime as often as Democrats, as it happens, Miller said. He explained that this type of voter fraud happens so rarely, and is ultimately so ineffective, that its almost a myth. Numerous studies have found that voter fraud , as Trump imagines it, is essentially nonexistent. 
However, as Miller noted, that doesnt mean American democracy is secure and that voters ballots are being properly counted. 
＆The attack on democracy has become much more sophisticated A vote counter inserts a tally card from an electronic voting machine into a card readers as they count votes at the Lake County Government Center in Crown Point, Ind., Nov. 4, 2008. 
Most voters use electronic voting machines to cast their ballots, though, in a few smaller districts, they may cast paper ballots that are then counted with computerized devices. But electronic voting machines lack a paper trail that could be used to verify that votes are being counted properly, and even the optical scanners used to count paper ballots can be tampered with, Miller warned. 
Miller said he believes that rigged electronic voting machines may already have been used to steal elections. 
Ive been concerned about the vulnerability of our elections since 2000 because of the rising use of computerized voting and vote counting machinery, Miller explained. 
In 2005, he published Fooled Again, which documented evidence that the Republicans had used rigged electronic voting machines to tilt the 2004 election in favor of George W. Bush, and against Democratic nominee Al Gore. 
In 2008, he edited Loser Take All, a follow-up volume containing further evidence of election rigging through electronic voting which was submitted by other electoral integrity activists and scholars. Miller summarized his findings to MintPress: The use of electronic voting machines and optical scanners to count votes is every bit as threatening to electoral democracy for all as the old poll taxes and literacy tests. The attack on democracy has become much more sophisticated. Its a stealth attack, very often. 
Key evidence often comes in the form of comparing exit polls with official election day results. Without a paper trail, this is the only way activists like Miller can compare voters stated choices to the final tally. However, some experts have warned that exit polls themselves could be flawed , limiting activists ability to definitively prove that fraud has occurred. 
While the United States is often considered an exemplar of democracy to which other countries should or do aspire, a 2016 study by the Electoral Integrity Project found the United States trailing behind other Western countries in multiple measurements of the vitality of a democracy. Carried out by researchers from the University of Sydney and Harvard University, the study examined 180 elections held between July 2012 to December 2015 in 139 countries, and found that U.S. elections were vulnerable in multiple ways, from the influence of money in politics to frequent and worrying voting irregularities on Election Day. 
Americans often express pride in their democracy, yet the results indicate that domestic and international experts rate the U.S. elections as the worst among all Western democracies, Pippa Morris noted in a March analysis for The Conversation. Watch  Could the 2016 Election Be Stolen with Help from Electronic Voting Machines?  
Harvey Wasserman, an Ohio-based electoral integrity activist, has also sounded the alarm about the vulnerability of electoral voting machines in a pair of books, What Happened in Ohio: A Documentary Record of Theft and Fraud in the 2004 Election and The Strip & Flip Selection of 2016: Five Jim Crows & Electronic Election Theft. 
In February, Wasserman told Democracy Now!s Amy Goodman that the election is vulnerable to tampering, especially in swing states where results will be close. He explained: About 80 percent of the vote nationally will be cast on electronic voting machines. There is no verifiability. In six key swing states〞Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa and Arizona〞you have Republican governors and Republican secretaries of state, and no method of verifying the electronic vote count. At midnight or whenever it is on election night, those two guys can go in there with an IT person and flip the outcome of an electronically counted vote within about 60 seconds. 
Miller agreed that elections are most vulnerable in tight races. He suggested thats why the GOP has been so passionate about passing voter ID laws and other forms of legal voter suppression . 
Thats one of the purposes of vote suppression, is to shrink the pool of eligible voters so the race is as close as possible, because if its a close election, the cheaters are going to win, he said. 
But he also stressed theres evidence that Democrats have also fallen victim to electronic voter fraud. Ultimately, though, its impossible to know who is responsible for vote tampering. Among other examples, Miller cited a July report from Election Justice USA , which suggested that Bernie Sanders fell victim to electronic voter fraud during the primaries. The reports authors wrote: Available evidence from Arizona, New York, and California suggests more than 500,000 registrations were tampered with or improperly handled. ＃ hundreds of thousands of voters were denied the right to vote or were forced to vote provisionally. A quarter million or more provisional or affidavit Democratic ballots were not counted. Available evidence also suggests that the vast majority of suppressed voters would have voted or tried to vote for Senator Bernie Sanders. 
＆We have to spread the word about this A sales executive with Sequoia Voting Systems demonstrates inserting a ballot into their electronic voting system in San Francisco, Dec. 5, 2007. 
Miller said his work suffers from an almost total blackout in the mainstream media, and even independent media often refuse to report on the risks of electronic voter fraud. 
The strength of the taboo on this subject is really mind-boggling. The press has always been exceedingly hostile to any discussion of this problem, especially if it entails a focus on electronic fraud, he said. 
Its probably going to have to take some kind of near revolutionary movement to force [the government] to make this a real functioning electoral democracy. 
Hope for reform isnt totally lost, though. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia, introduced a bill in September that would prohibit the government from purchasing internet-connected voting machines or machines which lack a paper trail. The legislation was inspired in part by lobbying from activists like Miller, working in concert with the National Election Defense Coalition , which Miller highlighted as one of the few NGOS effectively targeting the issue of election fraud. 
Meanwhile, social media allows Miller reach new audiences beyond the confines of mainstream media. A video he published on Friday about the risks of a rigged election had been viewed nearly 10,000 times by Monday night, and he hopes it will soon be seen by many more voters as it spreads through social media shares and word of mouth. 
We have to talk about it, we have to spread the word about this, he urged. Because only once people know the scale of the problem will there be any pressure on the parties to fix this system.",english,2016-11-08T15:51:36.624+02:00,mintpressnews.com,US,68691,Could US Elections Be Stolen?

A vote counter inserts a tally card from an electronic voting machine into a card readers as they count votes at the Lake County Government Center in Crown Point, Ind., Nov. 4, 2008. 
Before the recent torrent of daily Podesta email dumps brought renewed attention to Wikileaks (and accusations Julian Assange was working with the Kremlin despite his recent denial, which ultimately cost him his internet access), the medias attention was closely focused on the recently emerged hacker known as Guccifer 2.0, who claimed to be behind the hacking of the nearly 20,000 Democratic National Committee emails and other documents distributed over the summer by WikiLeaks, and who likewise was accused of cooperating with Russia. 
Earlier today, after a two week silence, Guccifer 2.0 reemerged, with a post on his blog , in which he alleges that he has information from inside the Federal Election Commission, according to which democrats may rig the elections. He then adds this may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies. INFO FROM INSIDE THE FEC: THE DEMOCRATS MAY RIG THE ELECTIONS Id like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies. As Ive already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities. I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly. I also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud. 
It is unclear what FEC information the hacker was in possession of, or was referring to, and how he intends to observe the elections. A recent video by Bev Harris of BlackBoxVoting provided a real-time demo of the GEMS vote-fraud system, fraction magic, an election theft mechanism with context and explanation. There is much more detail on the BlackBoxVoting website . 
The demonstration below used a real voting system and real vote databases and takes place in seconds across multiple jurisdictions. Over 5000 subcontractors and middlemen have the access to perform this for any or all clients. It can give contract signing authority to whoever the user chooses. All political power can be converted to the hands of a few anonymous subcontractors. Its a product. Its scaleable. It learns its environment and can adjust to any political environment, any demographic. It runs silently, invisibly, and can produce plausible results that really pass for the real thing. 
It is possible that this is the process that Guccifer is referring to, although we are merely speculating. We are confident he will provide more detail shortly.

This is what it must feel like to be on Death Row, to be waiting for the moment when the iron door clangs open for the last time and four burly guards escort you arm-in-arm to the room where your life will be extinguished. That same sense of dread hangs over the presidential election of 2016. 
No one is happy about the election and no one anticipates better days ahead. Americas ＆glory days appear to be in the rearview mirror while the steady downward slide seems to be gaining pace. This years presidential campaign has brought all the anger, anxiety and frustration bubbling to the surface. Nerves are raw, people are on edge, and the trepidation is so thick you could cut it with a knife. All the recent surveys tell the same story: Americans are sick of the mudslinging, sick of the scandals, sick of the recriminations, sick of the two party duopoly, and sick of the two candidates, the two most distrusted and reviled candidates in the countrys 230 year history. This is from the New York Times: An overwhelming majority of voters are disgusted by the state of American politics, and many harbor doubts that either major-party nominee can unite the country after a historically ugly presidential campaign, according to the final pre-election New York Times/CBS News Poll＃ With more than eight in 10 voters saying the campaign has left them repulsed rather than excited, the rising toxicity threatens the ultimate victor. Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, and Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, are seen as dishonest and viewed unfavorably by a majority of voters＃ After weeks of Mr. Trumps accusations that the election is rigged, a little more than six in 10 of his supporters say they will accept the results as legitimate if he loses. More than a quarter of Mr. Trumps supporters say they will probably not accept the outcome if Mrs. Clinton is declared the winner, and nearly 40 percent of them say they have little or no confidence that Americans votes will be counted properly. ( Voters Express Disgust Over U.S. Politics in New Times /CBS Poll, New York Times) 
The growing sense of desperation in America today is palpable and it goes far beyond this one, isolated election cycle. The steady erosion of confidence in the nations main institutions is evident in Congresss public approval ratings which seem to be stuck in single-digit territory. The public probably feels equal contempt for the Loretta Lynch Justice Department which is loaded with Clinton toadies that have done their best to quash any investigation into the illicit pay-to-play machinations at the Clinton Foundation. And, lets not forget the media which has lost whatever shred of credibility it managed to salvage after its myriad of war-promoting lies about WMD, mobile weapons labs, aluminum tubes and Assads imaginary chemical weapons attacks, attacks that were invented from whole cloth at one of Washingtons many neocon think tanks where these fake ideas are typically hatched. The Forth Estates latest gambit is an idiotic attempt to prove that Vladimir Putin is trying to hack our thoroughly-corrupted Third World voting system to achieve some nebulous political gain. What a joke. 
No, Hillary, Putin is not gaming the system like you did in the primaries with Bernie Sanders, nor did he put a gun to your head and force you to delete the 33,000 missing emails from your private server. That was your handiwork Ms. Clinton, although you have a done a masterful job in deflecting attention from yourself and passing the buck for your own sleazy, criminal activities onto Moscow. 
But, back to the media. This from Gallup: Americans trust and confidence in the mass media to report the news fully, accurately and fairly has dropped to its lowest level in Gallup polling history, with 32% saying they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. This is down eight percentage points from last year. Gallup began asking this question in 1972, and on a yearly basis since 1997. Over the history of the entire trend, Americans trust and confidence hit its highest point in 1976, at 72%, in the wake of widely lauded examples of investigative journalism regarding Vietnam and the Watergate scandal. After staying in the low to mid-50s through the late 1990s and into the early years of the new century, Americans trust in the media has fallen slowly and steadily. It has consistently been below a majority level since 2007＃ Bottom Line:＃the slide in media trust has been happening for the past decade. Before 2004, it was common for a majority of Americans to profess at least some trust in the mass media, but since then, less than half of Americans feel that way. Now, only about a third of the U.S. has any trust in the Fourth Estate, a stunning development for an institution designed to inform the public. ( Americans Trust in Mass Media Sinks to New Low , Gallup) 
Designed to inform the public??? 
You gotta be kidding? Droopy confidence in the media is a triumph for ordinary working people who have begun to see through the charade of unbiased coverage and realize that the corporate owners of the press manipulate the news to shape perceptions and maintain their stranglehold on power. Thats whats really going on, and thats why a growing number of people have swarmed to Donald Trumps campaign. They see Trumps lack of political correctness as a sign that he is not owned by the Washington oligarchy of racketeers who invent teleprompter candidates like Obama and Clinton who are never certain what they actually believe until they see it printed in bold letters on the screen in front of them. 
To large extent, Trump owes his shocking rise to the top of the GOP ticket to the fact that he shoots from the hip and that the media hates him. What was once a liability, has become an asset as trust for the despised media has plunged to depths never seen before. 
But that doesnt explain whats really driving this election and why are the American people so overcome by desperation? 
Its all about economic insecurity. Its all about the fact that standards of living are slipping, that an entire generation is bogged down with student debt, that all the good-paying jobs have been shipped to other countries, that family incomes are shriveling, that a good portion of the population feel threatened by immigration, that health care costs have skyrocketed, that retirement plans have been postponed, and that the great bulk of the nations wealth has been transferred to the 1 percent plutocrats and Wall Street landsharks who dictate policy through their Congressional lackeys and their allies at the Federal Reserve. Thats what the election is really all about. 
People are waking up to the fact that the American dream is dead, that the US is no longer the land of opportunity, and that the lives of their children are going to be worse than their own, far worse. This is why everyone is so upset, so frustrated, so hopeless. They are looking for a political ally who will address their needs, and instead they get bromides on transgender bathrooms or glass ceilings or any of the other soothing slogans the Democrats use to pacify the masses and to keep them in the flock. Only now its not working as well. Now a sizable portion of the blue collar vote has shifted into Trumps camp mainly because they see through the phony Democrat rhetoric and all the job-eviscerating free trade deals theyve pushed for years. Trump has skillfully tapped into the collective psyche of millions of working people who feel the Democratic Party tossed them under the track-hoe 30 years ago and never looked back. And, hes right, too. The Dems have sold out their supporters, and its only going to get worse under Clinton, or should we say, Madame TPP. Heres how Nile Bowie summed it up in a recent article at CounterPunch: 
Economic disempowerment and political disenfranchisement have accelerated under President Obama, to the detriment of the American middle class. White, blue-collar Americans have witnessed the offshoring of their jobs and the erosion of their status in society, and Trump has masterfully stroked their resentment and discontent by playing on their fears of Muslims, immigrants and minorities＃ Trumps real problem with the Washington establishment is that he isnt part of it. His campaign represents an insurgent faction of the oligarchical class that aims to displace and replace the standing political elites. Bipartisan opposition to Trump is grounded in the belief that he would be an unreliable proxy and a liability, someone too narrow and unpredictable to manage the common affairs of the ruling class and the US deep state. Moreover, the US establishment is not interested in being led by such a contentious figure, who would draw protest and public opposition in a way that more conventional establishment candidates largely do not. For example, Trumps rhetoric on immigration seems to engender more public outrage than the immigration policy under Obama, who has deported more people than any other president in history. ( Election 2016: A Political System In Crisis , Nile Bowie, CounterPunch) 
The big money guys dont like Trump, and they make no bones about it. But Trump isnt going away and neither are his followers, a vast number of whom will not respect the results of the election if Hillary wins. Thats a big problem for elites who like to manage the population through the popular election sham. Now all thats at risk. 
And its not like Trump hasnt bent over backwards to ingratiate himself with the deep-state powerbrokers either. He has. His first olive branch to the elites was the selection of Mike Pence as his running mate. Pence is a died-in-the-wool establishment Republican neocon who can be trusted to pursue the same extremist agenda the GOP has followed since the Gingrich revolution. But there was another big move that Trump made that escaped the notice of the media and which really underscores his willingness to play by to the rules. Heres the story from Zero Hedge: Six months ago, Steven Mnuchin became finance chair for the Trump campaign. Having successfully helped to raise 10s of millions of dollars for the campaign, the former Goldman Sachs partner and Soros Fund management employee is now positioned for something much larger as Donald Trump reportedly told his aides today that he wants Mnuchin to serve as his Treasury Secretary. 
Ironically, Trump has often criticized Clinton (and his former competitor Ted Cruz) for their links to the big banks: 
I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton, Trump said in one debate. 
But as we noted previously, he had no qualms, however, in hiring one of the most prominent Goldman alums to raise money for him. 
＃for Trump, a self-professed anti-establishment candidate, who has repeatedly stated he is not for sale to special interest groups, his sudden call for the seemingly most Wall Street of Wall-Streeters to become Treasury Secretary may come as a big surprise to some and will leave many of his supporters demanding an explanation. ( Trump Wants Former Goldman Partner And Soros Employee To Serve As Treasury Secretary , Zero Hedge) 
Another head of Treasury from G-Sax? 
That figures. 
Trump is great with the rabble-rousing take back your country tirades and all the gibberish about the rigged system. But he also knows how to cave in when it suits his interests. He knows hes not going to be president without Wall Streets nod, so hes enlisted a trusted insider to take care of business at Treasury. Its a signal to the bigwigs that they dont have to worry about the Donald going off the reservation. (wink, wink) So much for Trumps independence, eh? 
And what can we say about Hillary Clinton that hasnt been said a million times before? 
Clinton, who still holds a slim lead in most of the polls, is clearly the establishment candidate in a year when hatred for the corrupt Washington oligarchy, has reached levels not seen in the last hundred years. The fact that Hillary can run for the nations highest office while being investigated by the FBI, while being savaged by the daily releases of new, incriminating emails (from WikiLeaks), and while promoting a hawkish, neocon-driven foreign policy that portends a direct military confrontation with Russia, speaks to the fact that traditional liberal Democrats are either still hoodwinked by the Democratic Partys manipulation of identity politics or simply terrified of the alternative, Donald Trump. 
And thats why everyone is so utterly dejected and depressed about the election, because instead of voting for a candidate they really want or admire, most people are simply voting for the candidate that either disgusts or scares the hell out of them the least. What kind of choice is that? 
In less than 48 hours, the most agonizingly-wretched campaign of all times will be over, the ballots will be counted, and the new president will be named. The only thing that is certain is that, whoever wins, we lose.",english,2016-11-08T20:13:29.795+02:00,mintpressnews.com,US,68691,Doomsday Election,0,http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5162454502_d1523b1e05_o-800x452.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Inflatable figures direct voters at the Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters, Oct. 24, 2016, in San Jose, Calif. 
The 2013 gutting of the Voting Rights Act means the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) will deploy just 500 election monitors to polling places in 28 states on Tuesday〞hundreds less than in 2012, and imbued with limited powers. 
The DOJ made its announcement Monday amid escalated concerns about voter intimidation and discrimination . 
The bedrock of our democracy is the right to vote, and the Department of Justice works tirelessly to uphold that right not only on Election Day, but every day, said Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The department is deeply committed to the fair and unbiased application of our voting rights laws and we will work tirelessly to ensure that every eligible person that wants to do so is able to cast a ballot. 
But the U.S. Supreme Courts decision in Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder , which struck down parts of the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA), means that work will be curtailed as compared with previous years. 
The 500 personnel will be deployed in 67 jurisdictions across 28 states; in 2012 there were 780 monitors sent to 51 jurisdictions in 24 states. 
Not all the DOJ officials will have the full powers of election observers. As Reuters explains : Most of those states will receive Justice Department staff who have no statutory authority to access polling sites as a result of a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act, curtailing the departments ability to deploy election observers with unfettered access to the polls. [＃] Courts have granted the Justice Department permission to deploy full-access observers in five states: Alaska, California, Louisiana, New York, and Alabama. But the court order for Alabama only pertains to municipal elections and it is not on the list of states where the Justice Department is deploying poll watchers this year. The Justice Department staff who are deployed to the other 24 states on Tuesday will be election monitors, who must rely on local and state authorities to grant them access to polling locations. 
Bloomberg notes that the DOJ was able to send observers to 13 states in 2012.

The Russian president Putin declared another unilateral ceasefire in east-Aleppo for Friday: ""A decision was made to introduce a 'humanitarian pause' in Aleppo on November 4 from 9:00 am (0600 GMT) to 19:00,"" the chief of Russia's General Staff Valery Gerasimov said in a statement on Wednesday. 
Gerasimov said the decision was approved by Syrian authorities and was meant to ""prevent senseless casualties"" by allowing civilians and armed combatants to quit rebel-held eastern Aleppo....Defence ministry Sergei Shoigu said Tuesday that Russia had ceased air strikes on eastern Aleppo for 16 days, following criticism over a Russian-backed Syrian government assault that has killed hundreds of civilians and destroyed infrastructure, including hospitals. 
This is probably the last ceasefire on offer before al-Qaeda and CIA proxy forces in east-Aleppo are attacked in full force. 
These head-chopping ""rebels"" rejected the Russian offer: Rebel groups in Aleppo dismissed Russia's latest offer, with one of the groups describing it as a media stunt for ""public consumption.""
Yasser al-Youssef, a spokesman for the Nour el-Din el-Zinki rebel group, said Russia ""is not serious"" and its latest initiatives ""don't concern us."" He added that the Russian leader's comments do not reflect the reality on the ground. 
The great ""rebel"" attack from Idleb in the west on Aleppo to open a corridor to the government besieged ""rebel"" area in east-Aleppo has failed. Local fighting is still ongoing but the main attack has stopped. Most of the major hardware of the attacking ""rebels"", tanks and multiple rocket launchers on trucks, have been destroyed by the Syrian and Russian artillery and air forces. 
The Syrian Army and Russia have assembled major fresh forces in Aleppo. Syrian special forces are preparing for a big attack and Iran supported groups as well as some Russian units are on the ground. On Friday the Russian aircraft-carrier Kuznetsov will arrive on the Syrian coast. It adds some 30 fighter planes and attack helicopters to the assembled land based air forces. The carrier is accompanied by several destroyers and frigates as well as submarines. These add to the air defenses but can also launch salvos of cruise missiles. 
But this whole build up may have a different purpose than an all out attack on east-Aleppo. bigger 
North-east-east of Aleppo is Al-Bab, a city held by ISIS (grey) and campaign aim of Turkish (green) as well as Kurdish (yellow) forces. The Kurdish YPG forces (named SDF to disguise them as mixed Kurdish-Arab group) want to connect their areas in northwest-Syria to those in north east-Syria. They need the line from north-Aleppo through Al-Bab to the city of Manbij further east which is already in their hands. They are generally capable and well equipped but their forces are stretched and they lack major artillery and reliable air-support. From the north Turkish proxy ""rebel"" forces, supported by Turkish artillery from north of the Turkish-Syrian border, have moved south to prevent a Kurdish west-east uniting of their areas and to keep supply lines for ISIS to Turkey open. They are now on the geographic limits of the Turkish artillery support. The Turkish army is reluctant to move its artillery south of the border into Syria. The army is based on conscript forces and the Turkish people would start to make trouble for Erdogan if their drafted sons get killed in Syria. There is also no legal base for an invasion by regular Turkish forces. 
The Turkish air force has been supporting the Turkish ""rebel"" proxies in central Syria. But after it recently bombed and killed about 100 Kurdish fighters northeast of Aleppo the Russian and Syrian air forces have warned it off. Any Turkish plane entering Syrian air space is a legitimate target. The Turks understood the warning and have since stayed out of Syrian airspace. 
Turkish supported forces taking Al-Bab could be in preparation of an attack on Aleppo from the east, endangering the Syrian progress in the city. Kurdish forces are known for their notorious unreliability as allies. They change sides for minor bribes or issues. They could probably be trusted to take Al-Bab now without bothering the government forces in Aleppo but that could change any day. 
The third possible power to take Al-Bab is the Syrian Arab Army (red on the map). Since it took the Qweiris airbase south of Al-Bab back from ISIS it is only some 10 kilometers away from the city. A second direction of attack could come from the eastern parts of Aleppo. Taking Al-Bab would consolidate the areas between Qweiris and Aleppo and would be a good position to prepare for a later attack on the ISIS ""capital"" Raqqa southeast of Al-Bab and east of Qweiris. Areas directly north of Al-Bab could be let open for the Kurds to bother with the Turkish supported forces. The Syrian government will not protest when those fight each other. 
Starting this weekend we will probably see two Syrian government campaigns. A major bombing campaign against ""rebel"" positions in east-Aleppo as well as a ground attack by Syrian government forces against Al-Bab. I find this more plausible than an imminent ground attack on ""rebels"" in east-Aleppo that was not prepared so far by a major campaign from air and artillery forces. 
Something big Syrian military ""election campaign"" will happen in Syria while the U.S. public, government and media are distracted by their election circus. Are the other forces fighting in Syria, the U.S. supported proxies, ISIS, Al-Qaeda, the Turks prepared for such a new Syrian government campaign? Do they have plausible counter moves in store?   2, 2016 at 03:49 PM | Permalink",english,2016-11-02T22:27:22.465+02:00,moonofalabama.org,US,,"The Syrian Army's ""Election Campaign"" - Al Bab Or East-Aleppo?",0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Russia Says Ceasefire in Syria's Aleppo in Place Unless Militants Attack TEHRAN (Tasnim)  The Kremlin said Monday Russia's air force would stick to the ceasefire in Syria's Aleppo unless militants launch an offensive. 
""The (Russian) president deems a regime when Russian air forces don't carry out strikes on eastern Aleppo as reasonable if militants don't start combat action,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Reuters. Posted by: schlub | Nov 7, 2016 1:37:48 PM | 1 
Daesh Launches Chemical Attack in Iraqs Mosul 
November, 07, 2016 - 10:56 TEHRAN (Tasnim)  The Daesh (ISIL or ISIS) terrorist group has used mustard gas during a military clash with government troops in Iraqs Mosul, a report said. 
Daesh on Sunday fired mortar shells containing chemicals at positions of Iraqi troops who are advancing against the terrorist group in Mosul, Sky News Arabia said on Sunday, citing Kurdish sources. 
The report added that the Takfiri group had also deployed small drones carrying chemical explosives to blow up the government troops.

So I just woke up and found that the world has changed. World War III was called off. Trump won, Clinton conceded. His victory speech is fair and integrating. 
My ""not Hillary"" prediction for the election was right. That is, I believe, how Trump won. No so much by gaining genuine votes but by taking them from the crappiest candidate the Democrats could send into the race. This was not a ""white vote"". Trump did better with black (+5) and latino (+2) voters than Romney. Racism does not explain that. Clinton promised more wars. Those who would have to fight them on the ground rejected that position. 
The people voted against corruption, against international warmongering, against attacks of the culture of their life and against Zionist and Arab manipulation. In short - they voted against Hillary. 
The media with their outright and widespread manipulation and one sided reporting against Trump and for Clinton lost too. People did not believe the partisan crap that fact-checked Trump on every minor issue but hardly reported on the huge, huge scandals and corruption Wikileaks revealed about the Clintons. Fact-checkers ain't a good weapon in a culture war. The polls, but the one of the LA Times, turned out to be systematic manipulation. 
The leading politicians in Europe will crap their pants. Nearly all but Putin bet heavily on Clinton. The European media were also strongly pro Clinton, even more so than in the U.S. There was zero reporting about Trump's real political positions and support. Only tiny bits about Clinton's corruption were revealed on the back pages. They always believe what the NYT writes is the essence of U.S. thinking. It is far from it. No one but a few east-coast party goers and the NYT cares about some 16 year old girl, who thinks she is ""transsexual"" and wants to use a men's public toilet. The average people think that such craziness deserves zero attention if not a hefty kick in the ass. Pro-migration and other political correctness movements in Europe will have a difficult stand now. They can no longer work against the instincts of the people by pointing to the soothing, fake words of an Obama or Clinton. 
The Democratic party failed. The outright corruption of the party heads, who pushed Sanders out to move Clinton in by manipulating the primaries, blocked the natural development that went on at the base. They even wanted Trump as a candidate because they though Clinton could easily beat him. They were totally detached from real life. I am sure that post-mortem analysis will show that many, many potential pro-democratic voters were just disgusted and stayed at home or voted for a third party. The establishment of the Republican party were no better. They failed their voters just as much by shunning Trump and working for Clinton. All the neo-cons that flocked to Clinton will now scramble to get back to Trump. They will have little chance. 
But the election also created huge new dangers. People around Trump, including his vice-president, are not sane realist but fairly extreme ideologues. Trump himself isn't. He is, in my estimate, fairly pragmatic. The Republicans also won the Senate and House. There is a danger that extreme policies will be implemented with huge and terrible long-term consequences. But remember that Obama had the same chance in his first two years of his Presidency. He never used it. From a progressive view he blew it. 
Winning back the House and Senate in two years is a must for anyone with some middle-of-the-road thinking. 
I believe that this result is good for Syria and the non-Jihadi and non-Zonist Middle East. Al-Qaeda in Syria will have a sad. Their main supporters leave the stage. The result is likely good for Europe including for Russia. It is bad for economic equality in the United States. 
I for one feel mightily eased. The U.S. voters knocked over a chessboard that brought war and misery to many people. We do not know how the new game will look but I think there is a fair chance now that it, in total, will be somewhat less devastating for the global good.

The Podesta emails - After Hillary, John Podesta had been seriously warned about the Syrian chaos Posted by: nmb | Nov 18, 2016 1:59:59 PM | 1 
Although it is hilarious to see the Hillary supporters throwing a massive tantrum about 'fake news,' it does make it clear just how powerful having direct access to information is in negating money, mainstream media capture and control, and government propaganda. 
I don't know how much the new Trump presidency will change the US intelligence agency culture. But one has to assume they are apoplectic over their failure in Syria. Billions of dollars and years wasted all because people have direct access to information unfiltered out of Syria. 
It should have a completely unremarkable US regime change operation: 
* Send in the NGOs to agitate locals * Make promises of support for attacks on the government by the sole world superpower * Get selectively edited footage of your collaborators on the ground being attacked by the government(after they attacked the government) * Pump out mass amounts of propaganda based off that footage: ""Simple farmers rising up to overthrow a brutal regime!"" * Wield the tremendous economic power of the US to ensure the vast majority of smaller countries are on board with military action sanctioned by the UN * Flood the country with arms for anyone no matter how crazy to attack the government * Fake chemical attacks, US intelligence agency compromised UN reports and inspectors, etc. 
All of that derailed by nothing more than people having direct access to information uncensored out of Syria. 
I think it is safe to assume the US intelligence agencies are actively working on ways to make it illegal or impossible for anyone to publish, share, or consume 'unauthorized' information from countries that are targets of regime change. 
The easiest way would be to designate any source of information not actively working with or approved by the US intelligence agencies will be increasingly labeled as 'terror propaganda' and US social media and Internet providers will be required to censor or shutdown any such sources.

I was watching a travelogue program on PBS. The trip was to Cuba. The narrator traveled by train across the country. A train line that was originally built in the 1870s by Spain to divide the country for defensive and control purposes. The locomotives pulling the passenger cars were 1950s USA manufactured vintage and date to a time when our Federal Government had good economic relations with the Batista Regiem. 
When I think of the cruel and unusual economic punishment dished out to Cuba by our Federal Government all I can see is a bunch of financially poor peasants who bear the brunt of U.S. economic warfare. Just as in the Middle East and now Europe economic sanction wars hurt the farmer, the small business operator, the basic family unit, etc., while rich people get richer. Isn't it about time to back off on the economic war against Cuba and the rest of the Planet? Our collective cruelty seems to know no bounds? 
Just my opinion Posted by: ALberto | Nov 18, 2016 3:00:02 PM | 4 
Bernhard, I should think most of us reading and commenting here have pretty much accepted the result of the US presidential elections and are glad that Killer Klinton's ambitions have crashed and her future seems to be in a white house with steel bar columns and uniformed prison guards. 
The focus is now on President-elect Donald Trump's likely cabinet appointments, who are the most likely choices for critical positions like Defense Secretary and State Secretary, what the process is and how that is being carried out (or not carried out), and what that says about Trump's leadership and decision-making style, how he plans on being President and whether his choices are the right choices for his agenda (if it is genuine) of reforming the political culture on Capitol Hill, or ""draining the swamp"". 
If indeed Trump is intent on bringing changes to Capitol Hill, then there's a strong likelihood that the Soros-funded ""Color Revolution"" rioting around the US East and West Coasts will come to Washington and we'll be seeing a re-enactment of the Kiev Maidan events there. Posted by: Jen | Nov 18, 2016 3:01:27 PM | 5 
Does the Constitution of the United States require the president to have a specific number of executive departments? The answer is no. George Washington only had four departments in his administration as first President of the United States. 
Perhaps if Mr. Trump can't find suitable candidates for his cabinet when he ""drains the swamp"", he could assume the role as interim department head until such time as qualified non-militarists emerge from the private sector to serve in his administration.

@2 stevens..thanks for your comments. lets hope open access to information continues.. the signs of this happening don't look great, but they remain open still.. thankfully, moa is one of many sites where sharing info is of great benefit and continues.. 
M K Bhadrakumar's latest.. 
meanwhile obama, merkel, hollandaze and their italian counterpart have all agreed to continue for another year, the sanctions on russia over ukraine.. the bozo head for nato jens stalenbread or however his name is spelled, continues on with the disingenuous musings of an old king about to reenact a version of humpty dumpty.. 
meanwhile the witch hunt on acedemics, or anyone associated with gulen continues in turkey.. erdogan was visiting pakistan the past few days and i happened to read this on the usa state dept daily transcript from yesterday in the form of a question. 
Question :""Turkish President Erdogan is in Pakistan today, and he publicly suggested to Pakistan that the West was behind ISIS in order to hurt Muslims, quote, It is certain that Western countries are standing by Daesh. Now Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and many others are suffering from terrorism and separatist terrorism.Whats your comment on that? Do you think its a reasonable statement? 
MR KIRBY: No, I do not.""

No, you will not be seeing ""Maidan"". Middle America white (and not only) working class men are extremely well armed and are really angry still. So, if this rioting will come to Washington, who says that good ole' Ford Truck can not run over mountain bike of Tesla? Once the shooting starts (hopefully not) it will be a totally different game than Kiev ""Maidan"". There is also a trend, call it a hunch--most of US combat veterans from US endless wars tend to lean towards people like Trump. Posted by: SmoothieX12 | Nov 18, 2016 3:49:18 PM | 8

The Right firmly believes in Onward Xtian Soldiers for the Judeo-Xtian Axis, remember the $150,000,000,000 that 'Obama Paid As Hostage to Iran' was just a setup by the Right, that was Iran's sovereign national wealth held in overseas investments and illegally frozen by the Right as an *act of war*. 
When Obama agreed to end those illegal sanctions and let Iran retrieve their investments (which they may have done today, if you look at the huge market selloff), the Right again illegally crossed into Iran territory with their Navy patrol boats to create a false 'hostage' narrative. 
Those Navy boats know where they are by GPS withing 3.5 meters (10 feet), and Iran didn't beat them or waterboard them like AbuGraib or Gitmo, instead, they traded them for their *interest losses* on their illegally frozen foreign investments. 
With Huckabee as nee Ambassador to Israel, and neocon Pompeo as named CIA Director, and Jared Kushner getting top secret briefings to pass along to his Israeli blood-diamond partner Lev Leviev, you can bet the Xtian Soldiers will be pouring our blood and our treasure onto the radioactive sands of the Middle East, filling up the VA hospitals again for the Judeo-Xtian Axis of Greater Isreal.

We have one month before the electoral college votes. I suspect that this is the venue that the neolibcons will use to try to steal the election from Trump. The ""demonstrators"" paid and organized by Soros et al help set the background and provide the rationale for the ""need"" to ""accept the will of the people"". 
If this should transpire, then you will see civil unrest. The red states will not go along with the theft of the election for Clinton. Posted by: Perimetr | Nov 18, 2016 4:28:35 PM | 12

Even the ""blue"" states have very large and populous ""red"" areas--mostly beyond large urban centers which long ago became a cloaca of depravity. My point is, that this possible (how probable--that is totally another discussion) civil unrest, once ""red"" states America gets involved seriously, will not last too long for a number of purely tactical, operational and logistical reasons. This is if to discount the possibility of law enforcement actually enforcing the law and order which may, under certain conditions, turn very violent against those who will try to undermine constitutional process. Blue states can not win for mostly cultural reasons since, as I already stated, ""Red"" states' America is simply armed on several orders of magnitude better and is really angry. It is also tougher. Social and cultural composition of HRC's electorate speaks volumes--it is, in Steve Sailer's words (I think it was him), a ""coalition of the fringes"" and not very capable to start with.

WRT ""fake news"" and Soros paid rioters : Paul Horner 〞 the 38-year-old self-made titan of a fake news empire on Facebook 〞 is claiming responsibility for pushing Donald Trump to the White House, and says he has no plans to stop publishing fake news. 
In an interview with The Washington Post, Horner attributed his success to Trumps particular base of supporters. He is the man behind such viral headlines as The Amish in America Commit their Vote to Donald Trump and President Obama Signs Executive Order Banning the National Anthem at all Sporting Events Nationwide 〞 neither of which were true. 
My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers dont fact-check anything 〞 theyll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist, he told The Washington Post.

The coming conflict is between globalism and nationalism. The basic problem is numbers. Rule by monopolistic global corporations, at best, supports 20% of the population in the short term. It enriches the ruling elite and their servants and improvises everyone else. In the long term, climate change or a nuclear war, brought on by the blind needs of greed, will end the world as we know it. Brexit and the Trump Presidency proved that globalism and democracy are incompatible. For globalism to proceed in the middle term, it will require a surveillance police state, total propaganda, reeducation camps and the shutdown of this bar.

It's great that there's some dialog between Trump and Putin. I think at least Western Syria will be cleansed of jihadis as a result. 
But Trump might be a little more hard nosed in the future. After the tensions are dialed down and having the score at basically Russia 1, US 0, he's not going to be so pliable. He sure as fuck isn't going to throw Israel under a bus. He's not going to roll over on all American commitments in the region. 
Trump's been getting a complete rundown on the big picture. It's no secret that until recently he couldn't have found Damascus on a map. Now he knows about the Shiite Crescent and how the arms can flow from Iran to Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon in volumes like never before and how upsetting that is for Israel. 
Now there's action towards taking Raqqa by the Kurds and who knows who else. The US and its posse will provide the air cover and logistics plus lots of special ops once it kicks in. I'm surprised the Kurds bit again after taking it up the arse from the US a couple of months ago They're not going all in right now as things are ongoing in Mosul and will be for a while. But you don't hear Assad and the Russians squawking much about it. It's like they both know that parts of Eastern Syria are bye-bye. 
Trump's good will towards Russia certainly doesn't extend to Iran. And no American will ever call Hezbollah anything bur a terrorist organization after the Marine barracks truck bombing in Beirut all those years ago. If Putin and Trump are going to come to a general understanding in the ME there's going to have to be some give and take. 
Putin's done quite a turnaround in taking Russia from a pariah state a couple of years ago to the player on the world sage that it is now. It's looking good for him to keep his man in power in Syria and to establish a permanent presence in the ME with Khmeimim and Tartus. Once Trump is fully up to speed on the totality of American interests in the region he is bound by his office not to walk away from them. There will have to be some serious deal-making. Posted by: peter | Nov 18, 2016 5:16:47 PM | 21 Putin's done quite a turnaround in taking Russia from a pariah state a couple of years ago to the player on the world sage that it is now. 
Your timeline is a bit off. The coming of Putin was a direct result of NATO's 1999 aggression against Yugoslavia, while War of 08-08-08 was the start of Russia's return into big league. So, it is not a ""couple of years"". Results of War of 080808 actually stunned DC's neocon interventionist cabal.

Buzzfeed did some analysis on Social media generated fake news during the election. An awful lot of it was simply false. You can look at some of those headlines and judge for yourself. 
Ironically, Paul Horner (guy behind ""fake news empire"" I linked in prior post) said: He said he didnt do it for ideological reasons. I hate Trump, he told The Post. I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasnt messing them up as much as I wanted 〞 but I never thought hed actually get elected. 
Just happens 70% + of fake news this election cycle (according to Buzzfeed) was anti-Clinton. Posted by: jdmckay | Nov 18, 2016 5:47:15 PM | 23 
....and how the arms can flow from Libya and Zio-Ukraine to ISIS in Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon in volumes like never before and how 'upsetting'(sic) that is for Israel. 
Yeah, 'upsetting' to the Israel Likud former-Soviet mafia which fully supports ISIS and maintains 'Hezbullah' straw dog, to keep UN forces out of Greater Israel and torpedo the Two-State Solution and the Right-of-Return agreements which Netanyahu freely boasted he lied about supporting.

By Lambert Strether of Corrente . 
Tomorrow, election day will be only one week away. In this post I want to talk about two distinct subjects. First, I want to talk about the sort of calculation that a Martian might make when confronted by the choice we will face in the voting booth. Then, Id like to paint a brief picture of what election day would look like, in a world where I didnt want to claw out my eyeballs. 
A Martian Looks at Election Outcomes in 2016 
I say Martian, because a Martian is so detached that the 30,000-foot view looks like a close-up, and I think in this election detachment is a virtue (see above at claw out my eyeballs). 
So a Martian would feel that despite the all the sound and fury, the numbers have not been that crazy (assuming one trusts them). Among registered voters: Emphasizing how remarkably stable the &#39;16 race has been 〞 going back to Sept. 2015 https://t.co/odFykkIm8m pic.twitter.com/2CKuS9Qi9G 
&mdash; Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) October 31, 2016 
RealClearPolitics has a similar chart averaging all the polls with a vertical scale that makes the swings a lot bigger. To me, the pattern of the race is that Clinton starts out with, and retains, a natural institutional advantage of around four points. Again from the head-to-head RCP chart, Trump has closed and then pulled even six times: September 2015, December 2015, February 2016, May 2016, July 2016, and September 2016. And each time either Clintons institutional advantages have re-asserted themselves, or Trump has shot himself in the foot (take your pick). Trump is closing now. Can he pull ahead and close the deal? Unknown. Based on past performance, no. Then again, as I remarked before the latest email eruption, a week is a long time in politics, Wikileaks has yet to drop its final shoe, and each campaign probably has a garbage truck full of oppo fired up and ready to go. 
Paradoxically, Martians are not warlike, since the thin air, small population, and harsh conditions on Mars make war a species-threatening event. For the same reason, Martians prize the deep memories of elders while treating every child as precious. And Martians resist Marsization, because the one time there actually was a single, Mars-wide, cosmopolitan class of elite overlords they tried to invade the Earth, and who knows where that would have led! So if you were a Martian, and you believed that Clintons election would lead to a new war , and you believe that endorsing Bowles-Simpson and hemispheric trade in a speech at Goldman Sachs mean a Grand Bargain and TPP passage respectively, then you might look askance at a likely Clinton victory. What do do? If you had a Martian friend who followed American elections obsessively 〞 this is similar to Southeast Asian countries where people obsessively follow English Premier League football 〞 this is what your friend might tell you: 
The last thing you want is for Clinton to be able to enact her (real, private) agenda. Sure, she might make some small good changes, but if you throw war, a Grand Bargain, and the surrender of national sovereignty with another so-called trade deal on one side of the scale, its hard to see what outweighs them on the other, at least in terms of concrete material benefits.[1] So, working on the assumption that Clinton will win, what you need is: 
A Republican House . Here, the checks and balances built into the American system favor gridlock, and gridlock is your friend, since little legislation will get passed. Whether the House Republicans impeach Clinton if the Senate is in Democrat hands is an open question, but with Clinton having privatized the email server for her public office and the shenanigans at the Clinton Foundation , the Clinton administration will provide a target-rich environment. I woudnt put it past them to try to take Clintons security clearance away! 
A Democrat Senate . The emergence of left(ish) party barons with independent power bases is the untold story of election 2016. Warren is at least sound on banksters and financial power, and Sanders, while not a Bolshevik, is well to the left of the Democrat mainstream. Thats a Good Thing. Both are prolific fundraisers who dont need the DNC. If the Republicans hold the Senate, the tendency will be for Democrats to stick together. If the Democrats do, then Baron Warren and Baron Sanders (and allies like Sherrod Brown ) will feel more free to drag the party left. 
A close race . If Clinton wins, shell claim a mandate if the margin is a tenth of a percent. But in the same way that anybody can print money, but the trick is getting other people to accept it, others will be less likely to accept her claim the closer the result is. (I think the result would have to be better than the four points Obama beat Romney by 〞 51.1% to 47.2% 〞 and as of today, Clintons margin is 2.8% in RCPs four-way average .) Of course, Bush claimed a mandate in 2004, too 〞 true story: I managed to Google-bomb Bush mandate to Mandate magazine, back in the day when Google-bombing wasnt hard 〞 and proceeded to try to gut Social Security, whereupon the Democrats promptly gutted him and went on to win the 2006 mid-terms. But why make it easy? 
So, thats the Martian perspective on the race. Surprisingly or not, the personal characteristics of puny Earthling candidates are not a factor! Nor are cultural or class markers! 
Elections on Mars 
Here is how Election Day works on Mars. Again because of planetary and cultural characteristics, Martians reserve tricky and complex electronic devices for important things, like distributed Martian parallel chess, or space operas. They are also convivial, and they hate to be manipulated by large and opaque forces (that time the Jovians invaded). Obviously, I cant provide links for most of this 〞 the Uniform Resource Locator is a global standard, not an interplanetary one 〞 but in short form: 
1. On Mars, Election Day is a national holiday. Thats because Martians, unlike American Earthlings, think that everybody should have an equal opportunity to vote. Voting is equally easy for almost every Martian, whether they work or not. 
2. The Martians use hand-marked paper ballots, hand-counted in public. This is remarkably similar to international standards on Earth (which the United States does not use): 
Last March, the countrys highest court found that secret, computerized vote counting was unconstitutional. Unfortunately, the country was Germany, and the Constitution violated by e-voting systems was the one that the U.S. wrote and insisted Germans ratify as part of their terms of surrender following WWII. 
Paul Lehto, a U.S. election attorney and Constitutional rights expert, summarized the German courts unambiguous, landmark finding : No ＆specialized technical knowledge can be required of citizens to vote or to monitor vote counts. There is a constitutional requirement of a publicly observed count. [T]he government substitution of its own check or what wed probably call an ＆audit is no substitute at all for public observation. A paper trail simply does not suffice to meet the above standards. As a result of these principles,＃all independent observers conclude that ＆electronic voting machines are totally banned in Germany because no conceivable computerized voting system can cast and count votes that meet the twin requirements of＃being both ＆observable and also not requiring specialized technical knowledge. 
Hand-counting paper ballots is no good at all, argue critics, unless you really want to know who the actual winner of the election was＃ 
After the verdict in the case 〞 filed by a computer expert and his political scientist son 〞 Lehto wondered how it could be that open, observable democracy is seemingly an inviolable right for conquered Nazis, but not, apparently, for citizens of the United States＃ 
3. The Martians throw a big party at the precinct after the paper ballots have all been hand-counted. Thats partly because Martians are convivial, but also because the Martians think that democracy is important and ought to be celebrated. (Again, because the Martian population is small, they wish to begin the conciliation process between winner and loser immediately, lest fratricidal violence result, and theres no better way to do that than over food.) 
4. The Martians regulate all forms of political advertising for size (small) and frequency (not often), whether for candidates or policies. Thats because the Martians wish to minimize manipulatio by encouraging face-to-face forms of persuasion and deliberation in public venues wherever possible. 
5. The Martians ban published polling data thirty days before the election. Thats because Martians believe that they each should vote for their own reasons, and that elections (unlike markets) are not (manipulative) beauty contests. 
Conclusions 
Crazy Martians! What are they thinking? 
NOTES 
[1] Sadly, the time for an all-out assault on Republican obstructionism was 2009, when all the stars had aligned: The Republicans had no credibility, and the Democrats had the House, the Senate, the most powerful orator of our time (so it was said), in the White House, and a mandate for hope and change. Of course, Obama (assuming good faith) squandered this opportunity, starting with his inaugural speech, if not before.

Once upon a time, when choosing a new president, a factor for many voters was the perennial question: Whose finger do you want on the nuclear button? Of all the responsibilities of Americas top executive, none may be more momentous than deciding whether, and under what circumstances, to activate the nuclear codes〞 the secret alphanumeric messages that would inform missile officers in silos and submarines that the fearful moment had finally arrived to launch their intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) toward a foreign adversary, igniting a thermonuclear war. 
Until recently in the post-Cold War world, however, nuclear weapons seemed to drop from sight, and that question along with it. Not any longer. In 2016, the nuclear issue is back big time, thanks both to the rise of Donald Trump ( including various unsettling comments hes made about nuclear weapons) and actual changes in the global nuclear landscape. 
With passions running high on both sides in this years election and rising fears about Donald Trumps impulsive nature and Hillary Clintons hawkish one, its hardly surprising that the nuclear button question has surfaced repeatedly throughout the campaign. In one of the more pointed exchanges of the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton declared that Donald Trump lacked the mental composure for the job. A man who can be provoked by a tweet, she commented , should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes. Donald Trump has reciprocated by charging that Clinton is too prone to intervene abroad. Youre going to end up in World War III over Syria, he told reporters in Florida last month. 
For most election observers, however, the matter of personal character and temperament has dominated discussions of the nuclear issue, with partisans on each side insisting that the other candidate is temperamentally unfit to exercise control over the nuclear codes. There is, however, a more important reason to worry about whose finger will be on that button this time around: at this very moment, for a variety of reasons, the nuclear threshold〞 the point at which some party to a conventional (non-nuclear) conflict chooses to employ atomic weapons 〞 seems to be moving dangerously lower. 
Not so long ago, it was implausible that a major nuclear power 〞 the United States, Russia, or China 〞 would consider using atomic weapons in any imaginable conflict scenario. No longer. Worse yet, this is likely to be our reality for years to come, which means that the next president will face a world in which a nuclear decision-making point might arrive far sooner than anyone would have thought possible just a year or two ago 〞 with potentially catastrophic consequences for us all. 
No less worrisome, the major nuclear powers (and some smaller ones) are all in the process of acquiring new nuclear arms, which could, in theory, push that threshold lower still. These include a variety of cruise missiles and other delivery systems capable of being used in limited nuclear wars 〞 atomic conflicts that, in theory at least, could be confined to just a single country or one area of the world (say, Eastern Europe) and so might be even easier for decision-makers to initiate. The next president will have to decide whether the U.S. should actually produce weapons of this type and also what measures should be taken in response to similar decisions by Washingtons likely adversaries. 
Lowering the Nuclear Threshold 
During the dark days of the Cold War, nuclear strategists in the United States and the Soviet Union conjured up elaborate conflict scenarios in which military actions by the two superpowers and their allies might lead from, say, minor skirmishing along the Iron Curtain to full-scale tank combat to, in the end, the use of battlefield nuclear weapons, and then city-busting versions of the same to avert defeat. In some of these scenarios, strategists hypothesized about wielding tactical or battlefield weaponry 〞 nukes powerful enough to wipe out a major tank formation, but not Paris or Moscow 〞 and claimed that it would be possible to contain atomic warfare at such a devastating but still sub-apocalyptic level. (Henry Kissinger, for instance, made his reputation by preaching this lunatic doctrine in his first book, Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy .) Eventually, leaders on both sides concluded that the only feasible role for their atomic arsenals was to act as deterrents to the use of such weaponry by the other side. This was, of course, the concept of  mutually assured destruction , or 〞 in one of the most classically apt acronyms of all times: MAD. It would, in the end, form the basis for all subsequent arms control agreements between the two superpowers. 
Anxiety over the escalatory potential of tactical nuclear weapons peaked in the 1970s when the Soviet Union began deploying the SS-20 intermediate-range ballistic missile (capable of striking cities in Europe, but not the U.S.) and Washington responded with plans to deploy nuclear-armed, ground-launched cruise missiles and the Pershing-II ballistic missile in Europe. The announcement of such plans provoked massive antinuclear demonstrations across Europe and the United States. On December 8, 1987, at a time when worries had been growing about how a nuclear conflagration in Europe might trigger an all-out nuclear exchange between the superpowers, President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. 
That historic agreement 〞 the first to eliminate an entire class of nuclear delivery systems 〞 banned the deployment of ground-based cruise or ballistic missiles with a range of 500 and 5,500 kilometers and required the destruction of all those then in existence. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation inherited the USSRs treaty obligations and pledged to uphold the INF along with other U.S.-Soviet arms control agreements. In the view of most observers, the prospect of a nuclear war between the two countries practically vanished as both sides made deep cuts in their atomic stockpiles in accordance with already existing accords and then signed others, including the New START , the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 2010. 
Today, however, this picture has changed dramatically. The Obama administration has concluded that Russia has violated the INF treaty by testing a ground-launched cruise missile of prohibited range, and there is reason to believe that, in the not-too-distant future, Moscow might abandon that treaty altogether. Even more troubling, Russia has adopted a military doctrine that favors the early use of nuclear weapons if it faces defeat in a conventional war, and NATO is considering comparable measures in response. The nuclear threshold, in other words, is dropping rapidly. 
Much of this is due, it seems, to Russian fears about its military inferiority vis-角-vis the West. In the chaotic years following the collapse of the USSR, Russian military spending plummeted and the size and quality of its forces diminished accordingly. In an effort to restore Russias combat capabilities, President Vladimir Putin launched a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar expansion and modernization program. The fruits of this effort were apparent in the Crimea and Ukraine in 2014, when Russian forces, however disguised, demonstrated better fighting skills and wielded better weaponry than in the Chechnya wars a decade earlier. Even Russian analysts acknowledge, however, that their military in its current state would be no match for American and NATO forces in a head-on encounter, given the Wests superior array of conventional weaponry. To fill the breach, Russian strategic doctrine now calls for the early use of nuclear weapons to offset an enemys superior conventional forces. 
To put this in perspective, Russian leaders ardently believe that they are the victims of a U.S.-led drive by NATO to encircle their country and diminish its international influence. They point, in particular, to the build-up of NATO forces in the Baltic countries, involving the semi-permanent deployment of combat battalions in what was once the territory of the Soviet Union, and in apparent violation of promises made to Gorbachev in 1990 that NATO would not do so. As a result, Russia has been bolstering its defenses in areas bordering Ukraine and the Baltic states, and training its troops for a possible clash with the NATO forces stationed there. 
This is where the nuclear threshold enters the picture. Fearing that it might be defeated in a future clash, its military strategists have called for the early use of tactical nuclear weapons, some of which no doubt would violate the INF Treaty, in order to decimate NATO forces and compel them to quit fighting. Paradoxically, in Russia, this is labeled a  de-escalation  strategy, as resorting to strategic nuclear attacks on the U.S. under such circumstances would inevitably result in Russias annihilation. On the other hand, a limited nuclear strike (so the reasoning goes) could potentially achieve success on the battlefield without igniting all-out atomic war. As Eugene Rumer of the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace explains, this strategy assumes that such supposedly limited nuclear strikes will have a sobering effect on the enemy, which will then cease and desist. 
To what degree tactical nuclear weapons have been incorporated into Moscows official military doctrine remains unknown, given the degree of secrecy surrounding such matters. It is apparent, however, that the Russians have been developing the means with which to conduct such limited strikes. Of greatest concern to Western analysts in this regard is their deployment of the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile, a modern version of the infamous Soviet-era Scud missile (used by Saddam Husseins forces during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-1988 and the Persian Gulf War of 1990-1991). Said to have a range of 500 kilometers (just within the INF limit), the Iskander can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead. As a result, a targeted country or a targeted military could never be sure which type it might be facing (and might simply assume the worst). Adding to such worries, the Russians have deployed the Iskander in Kaliningrad, a tiny chunk of Russian territory wedged between Poland and Lithuania that just happens to put it within range of many western European cities. 
In response, NATO strategists have discussed lowering the nuclear threshold themselves, arguing 〞 ominously enough 〞 that the Russians will only be fully dissuaded from employing their limited-nuclear-war strategy if they know that NATO has a robust capacity to do the same. At the very least, whats needed, some of them claim , is a more frequent inclusion of nuclear-capable or dual-use aircraft in exercises on Russias frontiers to signal NATOs willingness to resort to limited nuclear strikes, too. Again, such moves are not yet official NATO strategy, but its clear that senior officials are weighing them seriously. 
Just how all of this might play out in a European crisis is, of course, unknown, but both sides in an increasingly edgy standoff are coming to accept that nuclear weapons might have a future military role, which is, of course, a recipe for almost unimaginable escalation and disaster of an apocalyptic sort. This danger is likely to become more pronounced in the years ahead because both Washington and Moscow seem remarkably intent on developing and deploying new nuclear weapons designed with just such needs in mind. 
The New Nuclear Armaments 
Both countries are already in the midst of ambitious and extremely costly efforts to  modernize  their nuclear arsenals. Of all the weapons now being developed, the two generating the most anxiety in terms of that nuclear threshold are a new Russian ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) and an advanced U.S. air-launched cruise missile (ALCM). Unlike ballistic missiles, which exit the Earths atmosphere before returning to strike their targets, such cruise missiles remain within the atmosphere throughout their flight. 
American officials claim that the Russian GLCM, reportedly now being deployed, is of a type outlawed by the INF Treaty. Without providing specifics, the State Department indicated in a 2014 memo that it had a range capability of 500 km [kilometers] to 5,500 km, which would indeed put it in violation of that treaty by allowing Russian combat forces to launch nuclear warheads against cities throughout Europe and the Middle East in a limited nuclear war. 
The GLCM is likely to prove one of the most vexing foreign policy issues the next president will face. So far, the White House has been reluctant to press Moscow too hard, fearing that the Russians might respond by exiting the INF Treaty altogether and so eliminate remaining constraints on its missile program. But many in Congress and among Washingtons foreign policy elite are eager to see the next occupant of the Oval Office take a tougher stance if the Russians dont halt deployment of the missile, threatening Moscow with more severe economic sanctions or moving toward countermeasures like the deployment of enhanced anti-missile systems in Europe. The Russians would, in turn, undoubtedly perceive such moves as threats to their strategic deterrent forces and so an invitation for further weapons acquisitions, setting off a fresh round in the long-dormant Cold War nuclear arms race. 
On the American side, the weapon of immediate concern is a new version of the AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile, usually carried by B-52 bombers. Also known as the Long-Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO), it is, like the Iskander-M, expected to be deployed in both nuclear and conventional versions, leaving those on the potential receiving end unsure what might be heading their way. In other words, as with the Iskander-M, the intended target might assume the worst in a crisis, leading to the early use of nuclear weapons. Put another way, such missiles make for twitchy trigger fingers and are likely to lead to a heightened risk of nuclear war, which, once started, might in turn take Washington and Moscow right up the escalatory ladder to a planetary holocaust. 
No wonder former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry called on President Obama to cancel the ALCM program in a recent Washington Post op-ed piece. Because they＃ come in both nuclear and conventional variants, he wrote, cruise missiles are a uniquely destabilizing type of weapon. And this issue is going to fall directly into the lap of the next president. 
The New Nuclear Era 
Whoever is elected on November 8th, we are evidently all headed into a world in which Trumpian-style itchy trigger fingers could be the norm. It already looks like both Moscow and Washington will contribute significantly to this development 〞 and they may not be alone. In response to Russian and American moves in the nuclear arena, China is reported to be developing a  hypersonic glide vehicle , a new type of nuclear warhead better able to evade anti-missile defenses 〞 something that, at a moment of heightened crisis, might make a nuclear first strike seem more attractive to Washington. And dont forget Pakistan, which is developing its own short-range tactical nuclear missiles, increasing the risk of the quick escalation of any future Indo-Pakistani confrontation to a nuclear exchange. (To put such regional dangers in perspective, a local nuclear war in South Asia could cause a global nuclear winter and, according to one study , possibly kill a billion people worldwide, thanks to crop failures and the like.) 
And dont forget North Korea, which is now testing a nuclear-armed ICBM, the Musudan, intended to strike the Western United States. That prompted a controversial decision in Washington to deploy THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) anti-missile batteries in South Korea (something China bitterly opposes), as well as the consideration of other countermeasures, including undoubtedly scenarios involving first strikes against the North Koreans. 
Its clear that were on the threshold of a new nuclear era: a time when the actual use of atomic weapons is being accorded greater plausibility by military and political leaders globally, while war plans are being revised to allow the use of such weapons at an earlier stage in future armed clashes. 
As a result, the next president will have to grapple with nuclear weapons issues 〞 and possible nuclear crises 〞 in a way unknown since the Cold War era. Above all else, this will require both a cool head and a sufficient command of nuclear matters to navigate competing pressures from allies, the military, politicians, pundits, and the foreign policy establishment without precipitating a nuclear conflagration. On the face of it, that should disqualify Donald Trump. When questioned on nuclear issues in the first debate, he exhibited a striking ignorance of the most basic aspects of nuclear policy. But even Hillary Clinton, for all her experience as secretary of state, is likely to have a hard time grappling with the pressures and dangers that are likely to arise in the years ahead, especially given that her inclination is to toughen U.S. policy toward Russia. 
In other words, whoever enters the Oval Office, it may be time for the rest of us to take up those antinuclear signs long left to molder in closets and memories, and put some political pressure on leaders globally to avoid strategies and weapons that would make human life on this planet so much more precarious than it already is. 0 0 0 0 0 0",english,2016-11-07T09:13:53.393+02:00,nakedcapitalism.com,US,54210,Comment on Election 2016: Playing a Game of Chicken With Nuclear Strategy by pretzelattack,0,http://www.tomdispatch.com/images/managed/klarepbk2012.jpeg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

By Silvia Merler, an Affiliate Fellow at Bruegel who formerly worked as Economic Analyst in DG Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission. Originally published at Bruegel Tim Duy s Fed Watch says that, as expected, the Federal Reserve left policy unchanged this month and the statement itself was largely unchanged as well. The near term inflation outlook improved from September to November, and with the year-over-year impacts of oil prices falling out of the data, headline inflation will track back upwards, which is not a big surprise. With regards to the timing of the next move, Duy argues that the language suggests conditions are moving in the right direction, but the Fed is still waiting for some further evidence. A continuation of recent trends will likely be sufficient as the further evidence needed to justify a rate hike in December. Would a Trump victory derail a hike in December? Duy does not think this is likely at this juncture, and we should rather be focusing on the labour market. A slowdown in hiring to something closer to 100k a month would probably end the downward pressure on the unemployment rate and raise questions about the Feds basic forecast that the unemployment rate will continue to decline in the absence of additional rate hikes. We get two employment reports before the December meeting. For the Fed to stay on the sidelines yet again, we probably need to see both reports come in weak. The bottom line is that the Fed is looking past the election to the December meeting for its second move in this rate hike cycle and probably it would take some unlikely softer numbers to hold them back again. Greg Ip , on the other hand, writes in The Wall Street Journal that Tuesdays election matters. Typically, the Fed is guided by the economic data and elections are just transitory nuisances with little significance for the outlook. But this is no typical election, as one of the candidates represents a dramatic break with economic orthodoxy  with promises of protectionism and tax cuts but few details. Trumps election would dramatically raise uncertainty, which is the reason why the stock market has tended to go down when his odds of winning go up. For the Fed, lower stock prices translate into less wealth, which is negative for the outlook in its own right. Additionally, the Fed will assume that uncertainty in the rest of the economy will mirror what happens in the markets. All of this reduces the odds it would actually raise interest rates in December. Ip argues that the Fed can take politics into consideration without being motivated by politics: when political decisions can potentially change the course of the economy, the Fed has to incorporate that into its decisions. Thus, a Trump victory would probably cast enough of a pall over the outlook to give the Fed reason to delay its next rate increase into next year. Ironically, Mr Trump may discover that he, not Mr Obama, is the reason the Fed hasnt tightened. Richard Clarida , commenting the FOMC statement over at PIMCOs blog, says that there was little expectation that the Fed would announce a hike in November. The committee members said nothing in their public remarks since the September meeting to suggest that a rate hike was under serious consideration this week. Indeed, the odds of a November hike as priced by the fed funds futures market were only 16%, and for at least the past 20 years the Fed has never moved when the market has priced less than a 50% chance of a move. As for the balance of risks, the language remained in the statement after making its first appearance this year in the September Fed statement. This is relevant because it would be difficult for the Fed to justify a hike if it believed that risks were tilted to the downside, or if the outlook were so uncertain it could not even characterise the risks. Clarida does not think that the Fed is trying to signal that the odds for a December hike have diminished. A year ago, the Fed wanted to boost market odds of a hike when it thought those odds were too low. Going into today  with those odds at 70%  the Fed appeared to be content to make minimal changes to the statement only six days before the US election. Whereas in September 2016 three FOMC members dissented, at this months meeting dissenters were only two. So this Fed statement seems aimed at making as few waves as possible: it is a placeholder until the Fed next meets and a rate hike in December continues to be likely, if not a done deal. Natixis Philippe Waechter argues that the Fed is ready for December, under the assumption that Clinton wins the election. He argues that the language on inflation is the only noticeable change in the language of this statement as compared to the previous one  together with the remarks on consumption that appears less strong than in September. The Fed wants to recover room for manoeuver in its monetary policy and this is the reason why it is by now ready to accept an increase in the rates. Nevertheless, it is also acting in a context where it needs to signal that it remains vigilant. In an asymmetric approach to monetary policy, the Fed prefers to act too late (at the risk of inflation) than too early (at the risk of a slowdown in economic activity). Tiffany Wilding , again on PIMCOs blog, looks at one indicator on which Feds officials have recently trained a lens: the labour force participation rate. The participation rate has risen 0.5 percentage point over the past year, and the rise has occurred despite demographic and other secular trends implying that it should have declined about 0.3 ppt. During the news conference following the Federal Reserves September meeting, chair Yellen highlighted this development as a reason to believe there is more slack in the labour market than previously thought. Wilding argues that the rise is not primarily the result of previously discouraged workers reentering the labour force, but stems largely from a decline in the number of long-term unemployed individuals (25 to 54-year-olds) dropping out. Notably, the decline comes on the heels of a very elevated pace of dropouts in 2014 and 2015, suggesting only limited scope for additional improvement. On the surface, its a good sign that people are now looking for a job longer. However, the CPS data suggest the number of marginally attached and underemployed individuals as a percentage of the working-age population hasnt declined significantly since the participation rate started to increase last year. Taken together, these developments could indicate declining and more limited labor market slack. With respect to the participation rate, Wilding believes that the demographic and other secular forces which have driven trend declines in the participation rate will likely take over again. She views participation rate trends as a downside risk to the case for two to three hikes in the federal funds rate by the end of 2017. Meanwhile, Kenneth Rogoff says markets nowadays are fixated on how high the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the next 12 months. This is dangerously shortsighted: the real concern ought to be how far it could cut rates in the next deep recession. Given that the Fed may struggle just to get its base interest rate up to 2% over the coming year, there will be very little room to cut if a recession hits. The two best ideas for dealing with the zero bound (negative rates and higher inflation target) are off-limits for the moment. Of course, there is always fiscal policy to provide economic stimulus. But it is extremely undesirable for government spending to have to be as volatile as it would be if it had to cover for the ineffectiveness of monetary policy. There may not be enough time before the next deep recession to lay the groundwork for effective negative-interest-rate policy or to phase in a higher inflation target. But that is no excuse for not starting to look hard at these options, especially if the alternatives are likely to be far more problematic. The Economists Free Exchange argues that not every argument for keeping interest rates low is a good one. Central bankers may be too keen to spot inflation in the data, but if monetary policy operates with a lag, it makes sense to raise rates before you hit the target, to prevent overshoot. When doves reject this logic, they are implicitly criticising the Feds 2% inflation target, not its strategy for achieving its goal. Inflation targets do not call for making up for past mistakes, and central banks should try to do what they say they are trying to do. This also means that in an equal and opposite situation where the Fed must bring inflation down after an upward shock, it should loosen policy while inflation still exceeds 2%. It is easy to dismiss these points as academic, given that inflation has been below target for too long. At present, the biggest threat to central bank credibility is clearly on the downside. But when doves deny the logic of changing policy in advance of achieving the inflation target, they overreach. The data show plenty to be dovish about: doves should simply point that out and, if they want a price level target, say as much. 0 0 0 0 0 0",english,2016-11-08T17:02:43.145+02:00,nakedcapitalism.com,US,54210,Monetary Policy at the Time of Elections,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Be sure to vote today if you havent already! Even if you dislike the Presidential choices, downticket races are important. 
And an overdue note: Thanks SO much to those of you who came out to meet me in Dallas last week. We had a group of 30-35 attend, including someone from Iowa and a libertarian who declared that NC was one of only three non-libertarian sites that he reads. We have a lively discussion and I think everyone had a good time. 
The organizer of the evening, Steve in Dallas, circulated a list for people who wanted to be on a Dallas Meetup listserv. Some participants had already left by then, so if you missed the opportunity to sign up and would like to be included or missed this meetup but want to be kept in the loop, please ping me at yves_at_nakedcapitalism.com and Ill send your coordinates to Steve. Please put Dallas Meetup in the subject line. 
At the end of the evening, Steve raised an important issue: hes tried getting friends and family members to read NC and other independent media, with much less success than hed like.

He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce ＃ Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living. And just as they seem to be occupied with revolutionizing themselves and things, creating something that did not exist before, precisely in such epochs of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes in order to present this new scene in world history in time-honored disguise and borrowed language. Thus Luther put on the mask of the Apostle Paul, the Revolution of 1789  1814 draped itself alternately in the guise of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and the Revolution of 1848 knew nothing better to do than to parody, now 1789, now the revolutionary tradition of 1793-95. 
If you ever wondered where that quote came from, now you know! A fine example from the 2016 election is commentators comparing Clinton to Lincoln. 
Stats Watch 
NFIB Small Business Optimism Index, October 2016: The small business optimism index rose 0.8 points in October to 94.9, slightly exceeding expectations and extending a rebound from the 2-year low at 92.6 set in April [ Econoday ]. A net 25 percent of owners reported raising worker compensation, a 3 point increase from September. Capital outlays, a leading strength of the index recently and important for future growth, remained at a strong 27 percent, the second highest reading of the recovery. But the NFIBs press release says: Small business owners are rattled by uncertainty and unable to decide whether to expand, whether to hire, or whether to make other important decisions that might boost the economy [ Econoday ]. And: the highest level this year [ Calculated Risk ]. 
JOLTS, September 2016: Job openings rose to 5.486 million in September, up from a revised 5.453 million in August but still on the low side of this years trend. Hires are down in the September data, to 5.081 million from Augusts 5.268 million to suggest that employers are having a hard time filling slots [ Econoday ]. With it hard to find the right person for the right job, employers are holding onto their existing employees closely as the layoff rate fell＃ [Im so old I remember when you could get training at your job! Good times＃.] Though hiring is down, these numbers nevertheless will confirm worries that wage inflation may be approaching, that employers will have to offer more to bring in the workers they need. Time to screw the workers take away the punch bowl, Janet! And: The data overall suggests that there was a slight cooling in the labour market during the third quarter, but not enough to discourage a December rate increase from the Federal Reserve [ Economic Calendar ]. And: [A]nother solid report [ Calculated Risk ]. 
Fed Loan Officer Survey: The latest Federal Reserve senior loan officer survey on bank lending standards reported that standards were basically unchanged for the commercial sector during the third quarter of 2016. There had, however, been some tightening of conditions on Commercial Real Estate (CRE) loans [ Economic Calendar ]. And: Bank credit tends to tighten up as the economy slows, which slows lending and makes matters worse.The buzz word is ＆pro cyclical' [ Mosler Economics ]. As weve seen, the bright spot in CRE is supply-chain related, e.g. distribution centers. And thats a bet on globalization, no? 
Shipping: Investors are following online retailers into warehouses [ Wall Street Journal ]. Singapores sovereign-wealth fund agreed to pay $2.7 billion for P3 Logistics Parks and its portfolio of European warehouses＃ in one of the biggest real-estate deals in Europe this year. The high returns on the industrial properties are a big draw, but the bigger attraction over the long term is the growing need for space to serve e-commerce customers in a European market with a limited number of high-quality warehouses. This is the second big buy in logistics for Singapores GIC Pte. fund, which bought the Blackstone Group LPs IndCor Properties and its network of U.S. warehouses. The upheaval in the market likely isnt over〞another Blackstone property, Logicor, is exploring either an outright sale or an initial public offering of a business that owns 660 warehouses in 18 European countries. 
Shipping: The top U.S. maritime regulator [Federal Maritime Commission Chairman Mario Cordero] says the ongoing consolidation in the shipping industry isnt leading to collusion to fix freight rates [ Wall Street Journal ]. Of course not. Thats the purpose of setting up a ginormous cartel, right? 
Shipping: The Port of Oakland said today its October export volumes reached a three-year high, increasing 20 percent over 2015 levels and posting the fourth-largest monthly total in its history [ DC Velocity ]. Port executives said that export volumes benefitted from weakness in the U.S. dollar that made U.S. exports more competitive in world markets and a strong agricultural harvest. Oakland is the closet seaport to the verdant growing areas of the Central, Napa, and Salinas valleys, and as a result handles much of the states agricultural export cargo. The port reported that containerized import cargo volume increased 2 percent in October. Overall loaded container volume〞imports and exports〞was up 11.4 percent, the port said. 
Shipping: [UPS] is buying medical-logistics specialist Marken Ltd., pushing deeper into the highly specialized and very profitable business of healthcare industry deliveries. The move is a play for high-yield business when many traditional industrial and retail customers are opting for slower, cheaper shipping＃.Closely-held Marken specializes in transporting clinical trial materials and medicine between 49,000 clinical trial locations around the world, work that is particularly sensitive in terms of time and temperature [ Wall Street Journal ]. For UPS, it also delivers a bigger entry into a growing market, particularly as aging populations in the developed world spend more on health care and clinical research expands. 
Shipping: Packaging machinery shipments in U.S. could reach $8.5 billion in 2020 [ DC Velocity ] [T]he fastest-growing machinery types scored by CAGR through 2020 will be the labeling, decorating, and coding (3.9 percent) and the case handling (2.5 percent) machinery groups. That rapid growth is largely a result of new legislation demanding increased labeling and coding, continuing developments in printing technologies, and the proliferation of SKUs, PMMI said. The other machinery groups include: filling and dosing; bottling line; form, fill, and seal; cartoning; palletizing; closing; and wrapping and bundling. Fascinating to see the interface between big data and stuff . 
Shipping: Container ship demolition hits record high [ Journal of Commerce ]. Shipowners have demolished 4.2 times more 20-foot-equivalent units so far this year than in the same period of 2015, with 500,000 TEUs. Most of the activity has occurred in the last three months, which accounted for 41 percent of the demolition thus far in 2016. The demolition activity in the last three months surprised BIMCO [Baltic and International Maritime Council] positively and it exceeded our initial expectation based on the appalling 2015 demolition activity, said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst, BIMCO. The advance is a push in the right direction, as demolition activity is one of the essential measures needed to be taken to rebalance the container shipping industry.'Rebalance. No Pakistanis burned to death lately , so were good! 
Shipping: Southern California chassis shortages recede as Hanjin boxes are cleared [ Lloyds List ]. 
Retail: Panjiva Research Director Chris Rogers told Logistics Management that when specifically looking at import numbers for things like apparel, especially winter clothing, and toys, which are both down, it suggests that retailers are not feeling ＆hugely confident about the state of consumer spending. And he added that it is in direct contrast to recent data issued by the National Retail Federation, which is calling for holiday shipping season (the months of November and December) to be up 3.6 percent [ Modern Materials Handling ]. From October. But still. 
Retail: A recent survey of shoppers weighed in with their answer to the question, Do you like Black Friday? Only 14.7% said that they love it, while 50.7% said it was okay. More than a third 〞 35.3% 〞 said they hated it. A rather staggering 85% of those surveyed either hated Black Friday or didnt care much about it [ 247 Wall Street ] ( original survey ). Throw me in the hate bucket! 
Housing: It is so interesting to once again see the ＆drive until you qualify meme permeating the housing industry. People seem to think this is now a new permanent plateau, a new normal, yet ignore the low home ownership rate and the reality that momentum is turning. But of course many are not paying attention  they are stuck in traffic apparently. Mega commutes, rental Armageddon, and insane prices for crap shacks are all part of the game today [ Dr. Housing Bubble ]. If you look at the rise in these mega commutes in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley it shot up in 2010＃ Something fundamentally shifted here. Of course you have your house humpers saying that this is great and somehow reflects a healthy market but in reality, it simply shows a hyper manic market of people desperate to claw into a crap shack. And many are now having to endure Clockwork Orange like torture in traffic. Many Millennials are simply saying no and are renting closer to work (or living at home with parents). 
Honey for the Bears: The restaurant recession has arrived [ MarketWatch ]. One factor is pressure on discretionary income from the rising costs of staples such as rent, medicine and education. Then theres the steady rise in the cost of eating out, which has come just as grocery bills are getting cheaper. The cost of food purchased for home use〞that is, groceries〞has fallen 2.4% in the past year, government data showed in October. Thats the biggest decline over a 12-month period since the end of the Great Recession in 2009＃ Food costs have shrunk because of a global glut in farm products such as wheat, rice, soy and corn. Then theres the effect of U.S. producers increasing the size of egg-laying chicken flocks and cattle herds, which has helped bring down the cost of eggs, beef and milk〞egg prices alone have tumbled a staggering 50% in the last year. 
The Bezzle: Amazon.com Inc. could be in the crosshairs of Europes taxman [ Wall Street Journal , Europes Taxman Could Have Amazon in Its Crosshairs]. That could be material for Amazon, which operates on thin margins for a large tech company. In 2015, it reported $596 million in profit on $107 billion in revenue〞a profit margin of 0.56%. 
Currency: Taking the nation by surprise, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday night announced demonetisation of Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes with effect from midnight, making these notes invalid in a major assault on black money, fake currency and corruption [ The Hindu ].

Most of the US will have to wait for polling stations to close  typically between 19:00 EST (00:00 GMT) and 20:00 EST (01:00 GMT)  for state projections. 
As for the final result? Stay glued to your phone or TV or set your alarm for 23:00 EST (04:00 GMT). Thats when West Coast polls close and history suggests a winners declared. It was bang on the hour in 2008, and 15 minutes later in 2012. 
Of course, if you go further back in history, 2004 was a nailbiter. I remember very well going to bed after the Kerry campaign said theyd challenge the result based on Ohio, and getting up in the morning to find out theyd caved. And of course election 2000 was what it was. 
There will be many sites tracking the results as they come in; heres Politicos for the presidency (they also have the House and the Senate). Its impossible to know which one is the best until data actually appears; I prefer maps with results as they come in by county. And speaking of counties＃ 
The final RCP averages put Clinton ahead in the national popular vote by 3.3%. However, with Trump ahead in Florida (0.02%), North Carolina (1%), and Clinton only ahead by 0.5% in New Hampshire, it still looks like a horse race, to me. (Of course, I may have become counter-suggestible to the idea that Clinton has it in the bag because almost the entire political class is yammering that she does.) 
Anyhow, if indeed this is a horse race 〞 and if our famously free press doesnt simply decide to call it 〞 well be up late waiting for county data in the states that are close (presumably swing states like Florida, North Carolina, and New Hampshire).

Even though this assessment of the Trump win and the implications for American politics going forward is long, its also meaty and very much worth your attention. Mark Blyth was virtually the only person to call a Trump victory virtually from the get-go (a colleague who spends a lot of time outside the Acela corridor is another member of that club) but also correctly gamed out how the stock market would react. 
Everything Blyth says is incisive, colorful, and on the mark. By contrast, its frustrating listening to Schiller because she is invested in way too much of the Dem orthodoxy, such as the Hillary scandals were manufactured by Republicans, that Sanders would have lost if he were the Democratic candidate, that Clinton was a victim of being a woman with a long political career (hello?). Similarly, towards the end, Blyth says, There is no left left, and explains why, and then Schiller begs to differ by trying to depict the Democrats as leftist. But she does have some random insightful remarks. 
In other words, you can run the video and tune your attention in and out, although you may then want to go back and listen to just the Mark Blyth remarks a second time.

  Tags: presstitutes , Clinton corruption , fake media (NaturalNews) To even call this 2016 president election an ""election"" is a cruel joke. Democracy is supposed to be about open, fair and free elections, and those elections must be predicated on open, fair and free access to information so that voters can make an informed decision. Yet all we have today is a media that's in the tank for Hillary, a justice system infiltrated by deep state corruption, a voting system rife with leftist fraud, a culture of extremist, violent intimidation of those who oppose Clinton and an Obama regime steeped in such criminality and fraud that it actively encourages illegal aliens to run across the border to America so they can vote.This isn't an election... it's a coordinated leftist coup d'etat .The aim of the coup is to occupy all the positions of power in America with radical leftists, communists and criminal democrat party loyalists. From those positions of power, the strategy is to systematically dismantle the American Constitution, Bill of Rights and Supreme Court while crushing the American middle class with punitive economic policies that keep the masses trapped in poverty (Obamacare, anyone?).It's now abundantly obvious to nearly every thinking person that democracy has been ripped to shreds in America , and the deep state criminal regime in power exists solely to protect and enrich itself at the expense of everyone else.GONE is the idea of representing the interests of the People.GONE is any desire for government to operate with transparency and accountability.GONE is any trust in voters by the powerful elite, who distrust the voters so much that they make sure every election is rigged in advance.GONE is any economic policy rooted in sanity or mathematics. Now, numbers and dollars from Washington are all rooted in mental illness and delusion.GONE is any semblance of the concept that justice is blind and that all laws apply to all the people just the same, no matter how powerful they may be.GONE is any public trust in ANY institution of government, from Congress, to the federal courts, to the regulators like the EPA, to even the FBI.GONE is any notion that the government should defend the nation's borders and control the flow of immigrants into the country for all the obvious reasons.And GONE is any concept of journalistic integrity across the mainstream media, an institution that now holds actual journalism in contempt (i.e. the work of Wikileaks or Project Veritas). Now, the media insists that no one question the government, no transparency is necessary, and government operatives have no obligation to explain any of their actions or cover-ups. Richard Nixon is rolling in his grave... The illusion of democracy Thanks to the complete abandonment of democracy and honest government in America, We the People now wake up each day as slaves living in a totalitarian dictatorship pretending to be a democracy , complete with a pretend press, a pretend judicial system, a pretend legislative branch and even a pretend central bank pumping out pretend currency.We turn on our televisions to watch pretend journalists named ""Stephanopoulos"" churn out pretend news that pretends Bill and Hillary Clinton are honest, affectionate, trustworthy elders instead of the phony frauds and crooks they've really turned out to be. And then we're blasted with pretend polls that claim the most unpopular woman in America -- Hillary Clinton -- is somehow ahead of Donald Trump by 12 points. Nobody believes the polls anymore... Every time REAL news breaks through the surface, the establishment tells us that's all fake. Wikileaks emails, we're ridiculously told, aren't real (even though they are). Project Veritas videos have been ""edited,"" we're told, as if that somehow negates the very clear words caught on video as they are uttered by Clinton operatives committing serious crimes.

Theres no doubt about it  the election of Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States has riled up the reality television stars hateful supporters  hate crimes have dramatically increased across the country. To add to the fear and frustration that many Americans are feeling, the Republican Party doesnt even have the guts to admit that the divisive rhetoric it has been spewing for decades has contributed to not only Trumps rise, but the hateful attitudes that helped him get elected. 
This denial and lack of responsibility was on full display on CNNs State of the Union this morning, when host Jake Tapper interviewed Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. When Tapper cornered Ryan and asked him to speak to the people who are afraid of the violence and hate crimes against minorities and women that have occurred post-election, Ryan said: 
First of all, I hate it that people feel this way. And second of all, they should not. I think people should be rest assured, America is a pluralistic inclusive country. It is, it has been and it will continue to be. So, I really think people should put their minds at ease. 
Tapper pressed him, reminding him that this was a serious, nationwide issue. Ryan responded by shocking Tapper and Americans when he denied that the GOP had any role in it, stating that the Trump supporters that were responsible for these awful acts arent Republicans. 
Thats terrible. By the way, thats not Republicans. We are the party of Lincoln. People who espouse those views, theyre not Republicans. We dont want them in our party even if theyre thinking about it. 
For the record, these attackers ARE most certainly conservatives whose main goal is to Make America White Again  there is no getting around this fact. And just when you thought Ryan couldnt be any more full of sh*t, he said: 
And Im confident Donald Trump feels the same way. 
Is he serious? Ryan and many other prominent Republicans have spent the last several months condemning Trump for his racism and hateful, divisive rhetoric  and even then, they were complete cowards. These GOPers distanced themselves from his actions, but never had enough of a backbone to actually do what was right and vote against him. Their loyalty to their hateful, discriminatory party has always prevented them from doing the right thing, and thanks to them we will now have a racist misogynist leading our country. 
You can watch the interview below: 
For Republican leaders to deny responsibility in what is now happening in our country is repulsive. They created a political climate that allowed Trump to thrive, and they supported a presidential candidate who encouraged the very violence and discrimination that we are now seeing. The GOP will not be forgiven, and they should not be able to pretend they didnt contribute to this mess.

Vladimir Putin has been elected the 45th President of the United Stares after a stunning victory last night. 
Putin, who was a surprise contender when he entered the race last year, consistently outperformed expectations outpolling all challengers and besting his competition in debates. 
Putin has announced that he will run the United States through a proxy as he is much too busy running the far more important country of Russia. 
In a shock victory, American voters showed they were prepared to overlook Putins history of running the KGB in favour of his perceived strong leadership and no-nonsense attitude. 
Doubts over his economic record were also waved aside, with uncomfortable facts such as Russian GDP halving in the last three years being dismissed as scaremongering. 
You fellow Americans, said Putin in his acceptance speech. 
I have so many people to thank for my victory; Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, Bradley Manning, but not least of all the Democratic Party, who put up the only candidate even I could beat. 
Oh, and I mustnt forget to congratulate myself too for putting the whole thing together.

The man whose job it was to rig the election for Hillary Clinton has been fired without a reference this morning. 
53-year-old NWO black ops operative Simon Williams spent the last six months programming voting machines to flip votes, and mailing bundles of blank voting forms to registered Democrats. 
However, his failure to swing the result means he is unlikely to get the fat payoff and pension contributions he had been counting on. 
Williams is also concerned that his lack of a reference to explain how hes spent the last few years of his life might count against him in the job market, with employers as far afield as Russia, Zimbabwe and Venezuela refusing to accept his word as an expert that hes good at controlling electoral outcomes. 
Sources inside the Democrat party have highlighted this as just the first American job lost by Trump and warned there could be many more, specifically in the polling and political punditry industries. 
Its outrageous, Simon told us. 
I heard there was a great role coming up as stage manager for the CIA, but they wont even talk to me unless my resume contains what Ive been doing for the last few years. 
Which is a bit rich coming from them, if I may make so bold. Youd think they of all people would be more understanding.

An Essex woman is facing prison for providing a dismal selection of cakes for the office to celebrate her birthday. 
The incident took place at the offices of Hadley and Kemp Solutions in Hatfield Peveral yesterday. It was Eileen Planktons birthday and anticipation was high as she entered the office with several Marks and Spencer bags. 
Oh yeah, everyone was really impressed, said a colleague who wished to remain anonymous. 
I mean  Markses; I thought we were in for a real treat. They do a lovely cream horn. 
After several hours of playfully tormenting her colleagues with amusing comments like ＆these bags? No, theyre just lunch. Im a bit peckish today, Mrs Plankton finally sent the following email: 
21 again, and if you believe that youll believe anything. Some sweet treats on Lens desk (hes off having his prolapse sorted, so he wont mind). 
However, excitement turned to disappointment as the true nature of the cakes became clear. 
Well, she might as well have just shat all over the desk, continued Mrs Planktons colleague. 
They werent Markses cakes at all, shed just reused the bags. There was a box of Poundstretchers broken biscuits, some cheap cheese straws and six boxes of Value jam tarts. 
I mean, I didnt know what to do with myself. This horrible silence descended as everyone saw what shed done. 
I just ate nine jam tarts without looking at her and walked off not even bothering to say ＆Thank you. 
Shortly afterwards the police were called, Mrs Plankton was arrested and she is expected to be sentenced to between 18-24 months for her crimes.

I think that was a big mistake, said Sen. Clinton. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.   28, 2016 Chomsky recalls being taken aback that anyone could support the idea〞offered by a national political leader, no less〞that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections. 
EDITORS NOTE: Donald Trump, as usual, knows what hes talking about when it comes to a rigged system with a rigged election . Todays story brings you a never-heard-before audio tape of then Sen. Clinton talking about rigging the elections in Palestine to ensure the outcome preferred by the United States government. Looks like Crooked Hillary thinks nothing of rigging an election  any election  to suit her personal purposes. 
On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. 
The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audio cassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. 
The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clintons Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is rigged. Listen to never-before-seen audiotape of Crooked Hillary talking about rigging election in Palestine: 
Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). 
I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake, said Sen. Clinton. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. Chomsky recalls being taken aback that anyone could support the idea〞offered by a national political leader, no less〞that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections. 
Some eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency. 
Regarding capturing combatants in war〞the June capture of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants who came across the Gaza border via an underground tunnel was very much front of mind〞Clinton can be heard on the tape saying, And then, when, you know, Hamas, you know, sent the terrorists, you know, through the tunnel into Israel that killed and captured, you know, kidnapped the young Israeli soldier, you know, theres a sense of like, one-upsmanship, and in these cultures of, you know, well, if they captured a soldier, weve got to capture a soldier. Trump on Election Rigging | Third Presidential Debate Highlights 
Equating Hamas , which to this day remains on the State Departments official list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, with the armed forces of a close American ally was not what many expected to hear in the Jewish Press editorial offices, which were then at Third Avenue and Third Street in Brooklyn. (The papers office has since moved to the Boro Park section of Brooklyn.) The use of the phrase these cultures is also a bit of a head-scratcher. 
According to Chomsky, Clinton was gracious, personable and pleasant throughout the interview, taking about an hour to speak to, in addition to himself, managing editor Jerry Greenwald, assistant to the publisher Naomi Klass Mauer, counsel Dennis Rapps and senior editor Jason Maoz. 
Another part of the tape highlights something that was relatively uncontroversial at the time but has taken on new meaning in light of the current campaign〞speaking to leaders with whom our country is not on the best terms. Clinton has presented a very tough front in discussing Russia, for example, accusing Trump of unseemly ardor for strongman Vladimir Putin and mocking his oft-stated prediction that as president hed get along with Putin. 
Chomsky is heard on the tape asking Clinton what now seems like a prescient question about Syria, given the disaster unfolding there and its looming threat to drag the U.S., Iran and Russia into confrontation. 
Do you think its worth talking to Syria〞both from the U.S. point [of view] and Israels point [of view]? 
Clinton replied, You know, Im pretty much of the mind that I dont see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as youre not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them, an answer that reflects her mastery of the facts but also reflects a willingness to talk to Russia that sounds more like Trump 2016 than Clinton 2016. 
Shortly after, she said, But if you say, ＆theyre evil, were good, [and] were never dealing with them, I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them＃So I would like to talk to you [the enemy] because I want to know more about you. Because if I want to defeat you, Ive got to know something more about you. I need different tools to use in my campaign against you. Thats my take on it. 
A final bit of interest to the current campaign involves an articulation of phrases that Trump has accused Clinton of being reluctant to use. Discussing the need for a response to terrorism, Clinton said, I think you can make the case that whether you call it ＆Islamic terrorism or ＆Islamo-fascism, whatever the label is were going to give to this phenomenon, its a threat. Its a global threat. To Europe, to Israel, to the United States＃Therefore we need a global response. Its a global threat and it needs a global response. That can be the, sort of, statement of principle＃So I think sometimes having the global vision is a help as long as you realize that underneath that global vision theres a lot of variety and differentiation that has to go on. 
Its not clear what she means by a global vision with variety and differentiation, but whats quite clear is that the then-senator, just five years after her state was the epicenter of the September 11 attacks, was comfortable deploying the phrase Islamic terrorism and the even more strident Islamo-fascism, at least when meeting with the editorial board of a Jewish newspaper. 
In an interview before the Observer heard the tape, Chomsky told the Observer that Clinton made some odd and controversial comments on the tape. The irony of a decade-old recording emerging to feature a candidate making comments that are suddenly relevant to voters today was not lost on Chomsky, who wrote the original story at the time. Oddly enough, that story, headlined Hillary Clinton on Israel, Iraq and Terror, is no longer available on jewishpress.com and even a short summary published on the Free Republic offers a broken link that can no longer surface the story. 
I went to my bosses at the time, Chomsky told the Observer. The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody〞even a direct quote from anyone〞in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didnt think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.

Some priced plans aggressively, angling for market share and betting special programs built into the law would protect them from losses. Those protections didnt work as expected. Enrollees health-care expenses repeatedly overshot the projections of nearly all Arizonas insurers. The result: a flood of red ink, then withdrawals and premium increases.   When Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces launched in fall 2013, Arizona seemed like a success. Eight insurers competed to sign up consumers, offering a wide variety of plans and some of the lowest premiums in the country. 
Today, with ACA enrollment starting Nov. 1 , Arizonans will find in most counties only one insurer selling exchange plans for 2017. Premiums for some plans will be more than double this year, some of the biggest increases in the nation. Only last-minute maneuvering prevented one Arizona county from becoming the first in the nation to have no exchange insurers at all. 
A similar dynamic is playing out in other states exchanges, which are a critical centerpiece of the 2010 health law. About one-third of U.S. counties will have just one exchange insurer next year , up from 7% this year, estimates the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health-care issues. In many cases, remaining insurers are seeking significant rate increases. Obama on Showing ACA Works: ＆Were Not Going To Get That Much Help Through the Media 
A look at what happened in Arizona shows the cascading effects of problems with the design and implementation of the ACA, combined with early missteps by insurers. Some priced plans aggressively, angling for market share and betting special programs built into the law would protect them from losses. Those protections didnt work as expected. Enrollees health-care expenses repeatedly overshot the projections of nearly all Arizonas insurers. The result: a flood of red ink, then withdrawals and premium increases. 
The Arizona market is the poster child for the problems the exchanges are experiencing nationally, says Tom Snook, a Phoenix-based actuary for consultants Milliman Inc. 
Opponents of the health law have cited the problems in Arizona and other states to argue for unraveling the legislation, and they have proposed changes such as expanding health-savings accounts and allowing insurers to sell plans across state lines. Trump: My employees are having problems with Obamacare 
Obama administration officials say they are bolstering the exchanges, and the consumer impact of premium increases will be limited by the laws subsidies for lower-income people, received by about 85% of enrollees nationally. Were making really good progress in addressing a lot of the issues, says Kevin Counihan, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services unit charged with implementing the health law. He calls Arizona an outlier, saying that insurers elsewhere have succeeded with ACA plans. 
The ACA transformed the individual insurance market, where consumers buy their own plans. Before the law, insurers could refuse to sell to people with pre-existing health conditions. Starting in 2014, consumers couldnt be denied coverage, or charged more, if they were ill. Individuals could shop for plans via an online marketplace. Partly to ensure that healthy people signed up to balance out the sick, the law contained penalties for most people if they didnt obtain coverage. Arizona expanded Medicaid, as the law envisioned. 
Insurers saw uncertainty in the new marketplace, but also potential. They had to guess what prices they needed to charge to cover the health costs of new enrollees. A 2013 Society of Actuaries report suggested that the Arizona individual-insurance market could more than double, growing to 570,681 consumers, with more than 80% of them buying through the exchange. The health-care costs of the newer customer base would be around 22% higher than the old one, it suggested. President dodges blame for Obamacare premium increases 
Insurers believed they had protective guardrails 〞programs in the law to limit losses for companies that drew a lot of unhealthy, high-cost consumers. One insurer, Health Net Inc., told investors in November 2013 it could effectively pay out $1.20 in claims for each $1 it got in premiums and still break even with help from an ACA program called risk corridors. Some of Health Nets Arizona products were among the lowest-priced in the country, according to Kaiser. 
Kim Walton, 62 years old, of Tempe, says his monthly insurance bill dropped by more than two-thirds compared with his pre-ACA plan, with help from a federal subsidy. Unlike his old plan, his new ACA insurance covered any costs tied to his pre-existing health conditions〞he earlier had a hip replacement and suffered a broken neck. It was perfect, says Mr. Walton, who owns his own business. 
Krysti Horwitz of Phoenix steered clear of the exchange. Ms. Horwitz, 35, and her husband, who own an online-marketing business, were healthy. In 2013, they had a plan that she said cost them significantly less than a new ACA one would. They werent eligible for subsidies. They decided to keep what they had, an option the Obama administration authorized in late 2013. 
By spring of 2014, with the first year of the new ACA plans barely under way, insurers had to guess again at pricing. Rate requests for 2015 plans were due, though insurers still had scant information about who signed up. That was partly because federal officials extended the deadline for enrollment after technical problems with HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange being used in Arizona and many other states. 
One thing was already clear: Health Nets low-price gambit had won huge market share. The company ended up with nearly 92,000 enrolled in individual plans in 2014, more than seven times its 2013 total, according to insurance-data firm Mark Farrah Associates Health Coverage Portal. 
That posed a challenge for rivals, including startup Meritus, one of the nonprofit cooperative plans launched under the ACA. Meritus drew only a few thousand consumers in 2014, and it needed to boost enrollment to sustain itself, according to Tom Zumtobel,the co-ops former CEO, who took over in late 2014. 
Meritus worked to reduce its prices, and its rates came in below competitors in 2015. 
Once again that year, Arizona had some of the lowest exchange premiums in the U.S., and one of the most competitive marketplaces, with 11 insurers, according to the Kaiser data. Enrollment grew, particularly at Meritus, where it surged to about 48,000 in 2015, according to Mark Farrah Associates. 
On Oct. 1, 2015, insurers got a huge blow: Federal regulators announced the risk-corridor program, which many companies expected to limit their financial risk, would pay out only 12.6% of the amount expected . The program hadnt taken in enough money from successful insurers to cover the requests of those with significant losses. 
For Meritus, it was operationally devastating, says Mr. Zumtobel. That Oct. 30, just two days before consumers were set to start buying their 2016 exchange plans, Arizonas regulator put the co-op under supervision, barring it from selling new insurance policies. 
Remaining insurers began retrenching. The 2016 plans included more-limited networks of health-care providers. The total number of exchange insurers ticked down to eight, from 11, and premiums rose. We started to see the cracks, says Jerry Anderson, an insurance agent in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
Nearly all the Arizona individual business of exchange insurers plunged into the red, according to Mark Farrah Associates, the insurance-data firm. Health Net booked nearly $40 million in losses on its Arizona individual business in 2014, and another $39 million the following year, according to Mark Farrah Associates, when the insurer agreed to be acquired by Centene Corp. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, the biggest player in the states individual market, had priced less aggressively than Health Net but still saw steep losses. 
Based on regulatory filings, McKinsey & Co. estimated the insurance industry suffered cumulative losses of between 9% and 11% of premium revenue on individual plans last year. Only about one-quarter of insurers reported a profit on the business. 
In Arizona, insurers set their rates too low to cover their enrollees health expenses. There were fewer people than actuaries once projected, with about 203,000 choosing exchange plans during the enrollment period for this year. The share of enrollees who were healthy was smaller than companies projected, partly because the laws penalties werent enough to prod them to enroll, insurers say. The unhealthy people who did sign up were more costly. Insurers say that some consumers appeared to be buying plans specifically when they had health needs. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizonas ACA plans in 2014 were priced around 35% higher on average than its individual plans in 2013. In hindsight, it wasnt even close to enough, says Jeff Stelnik, a senior vice president at the nonprofit. ACA-plan enrollees had medical costs around 250% higher on average than individual members before the health law, due partly to far higher prevalence of conditions such as diabetes, he says. 
Insurers began to bail out. On April 19, UnitedHealth Group Inc. said it would pull out of nearly all state ACA exchanges , including Arizonas, for the next year amid growing losses. Others in Arizona retreated, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona and Health Net, which decided to pull out of the states most populous county, Maricopa, as well as adjacent Pinal, for 2017. On Aug. 15, Aetna Inc. announced it would leave most of its exchanges , including Arizonas. Aetnas decision created a crisis: Pinal County would have no exchange insurers for 2017. The void would short-circuit a central mechanism of the law, because consumers can get subsidies only through an ACA marketplace. 
The situation drew attention from Republicans critical of the ACA, including Arizona Sen. John McCain . He introduced a bill meant to protect AZ from Obamacare collapse, according to a press release. Obama administration officials said they believed the situation would be resolved. 
In September, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona announced it would continue to sell exchange plans in Pinal next year after all. The decision came after state and federal regulators expressed their concern for Pinal residents, though the insurer made the call on its own, says Blue Crosss Mr. Stelnik. 
Neighboring Maricopa County, the states most populous, also ended up with just one insurer〞Centene, Health Nets new parent, which announced Sept. 14 it would sell exchange plans there next year. Centene CEO Michael F. Neidorff says his company has a very different approach from Health Net, which he says thought they would get the revenue, the growth, and relied on ACA risk programs for protection. Centene said it expects to be profitable in Arizona, as it has been in other exchanges. 
That left only one county in Arizona, Pima, with more than one exchange insurer〞it has two. There will be a few more options sold outside the exchange, to people who dont get federal subsidies. 
Premium increases are steep, though the effect will be blunted for those who get subsidies. Blue Crosss rates are up by an average of 51% from this year, Centenes Health Net units, by nearly 75%. 
Mr. Walton, the consumer who benefited from lower premiums at the start of the exchange, worries he wont be able to find a plan that includes his primary-care physician and his cardiologist. I dont know whats going to happen come November, he says.

Bernie Saunders 〞 distrust Clinton, said Wayne Bradley, state director of African-American engagement for the Michigan Republican Party. by Geoffrey Grider November 5, 2016 Donald Trump is on track to double Gov. Mitt Romneys support among African-American voters, according to a series of state polls. In 2012, African-Americans comprised a record 13 percent of all voters. President Barack Obama was reelected with 93 percent of the African-American vote, leaving Gov. Mitt Romney with only 6 percent of the African-American vote. Obama is now campaigning against Trump, and hoping to keep his share of the African-American vote below the 11 percent that George W. Bush won in 2004 during the housing bubble. On Friday , a poll of 506 Pennsylvania voters by Harper Polling showed Trump has the support of 18.46 percent of African-Americans. Thats eight points more than Romneys share of the national vote in 2012, and if it proves true during the ballot, that 18.46 percent African-American support translates into 2 point shift towards Trump. The poll also said another 4.6 percent were undecided. Trump acknowledges ＆Blacks for Trump supporters: The Harper poll is small , with an error margin of 4.4 percent, but an Oct. 30 poll of 1,249 likely voters in Pennsylvania showed Trump has 19 percent support among African Americans, while another 7 percent remain undecided. That poll has a error margin of 2.77 percent. In next-door Michigan, two nights of a tracking poll conducted for Fox 2 of 1,150 likely voters showed Trump with 14 percent support and 19 percent support, leaving Clinton with 83 percent and 79 percent support. Thats equivalent to a two-point shift from Clinton to Trump in the state. Were showing Donald Trump doing far better among African-Americans than any other Republican in modern memory, said John Yob, CEO of a Michigan-based polling firm, Strategic National . Trump has done an excellent job in campaigning for the votes of African-Americans, he said, partly by campaigning in Detroit, said Yob, whose automated tracking polls show Trump and Clinton running level in the state. Black Trump Supporters Explain Why They are Voting for Donald Trump: Donald Trump is gaining in Michigan partly because many African-American voters 〞 especially younger voters who backed Sen. Bernie Saunders 〞 distrust Clinton, said W ayne Bradley, state director of African-American engagement for the Michigan Republican Party. T here is a tremendous trust deficit with Hillary Clinton because tough anti-crime laws established when her husband was president in the 1990s, he said. That distrust has helped cause a sharp drop in the number of absentee ballots mailed in from Detroit, even as other part of the state send in more ballots that before, Bradley said. Faced with a low turnout, the Clinton campaign is trying to frighten African-Americans to vote, but t hats not a convincing enough argument, he said. Detroit as of Wednesday had seen absentee ballots returns equaling just 46 percent of the total 2012 absentee vote in the city, and the city clerks office is forecasting a decline of 10,000 absentee ballots compared to 2012, a fall of 12.5 percent, according to a review of absentee records by the Gongwer.com website, which intensively tracks Michigan politics. It is possible that the falloff portends reduced [election day] voting at the precincts, in which case ＃ Clinton could net something like 32,000 fewer votes out of the city than President Barack Obama did in 2012. But other polls offer better news to Clinton. A Detroit Free Press poll of 600 likely Michigan voters released Nov. 4 showed that Among black voters, her margin also grew substantially, to 92% compared to 88% two weeks ago. National Trends Trumps gain among African-American voters is happening in many states, alongside an overall reduction in African-American enthusiasm and support for Obamas designated successor. That drop-off in support from Obamas 93 percent level will likely reduce the turnout for Clinton. MSNBC reporter wasnt expecting Black Americans to vote for Trump: Thats a problem for Democrats, because a 7.5 percent drop in nationwide African-American turnout would be equal to a one-point drop in a nationwide vote for Clinton. Reports say the early-voting turnout by African-Americans has dropped by up to 10 percent in North Carolina and by somewhat less in Florida . President Barack Obama and other top Democrats have hopscotched through the states to push that turnout back up by election day. But pollsters face problems when trying to gauge opinions in a high-stakes emotional competition. For example, a large slice of African-Americans are picking undecided in some polls. The Washington Post is reporting that Clinton is leading Trump by 79 percentage points among African-Americans, but the fine print in the article says Clintons score is 82 percent and Trumps score is 3 percent 〞 leaving 15 percent who did not pick either candidate. So if Trump gets just one-in-five of the undecided African-American voters, he reaches Romneys 2012 level. Blacks for Trump, Its a Thing: Some concerned people lie to pollsters. For example, roughly 7 percent of college grads hide their support for Trump when theyre ask by pollsters over the phone, perhaps out of fear of penalties if their choice was made public. So when polls show a non-answer from respondents, for example, many undecided voters, the votes may be hiding a weak or strong preference for Trump. These factor may be impacting polls of African-Americans, who are being hammered by claims from Clinton and Obama that Trump is supposedly a racist. If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers 〞 the Klan 〞 and hesitate when asked about that support, then youll tolerate that support when youre in office, Obama told an African-American crowd in North Carolina on Nov. 3. For example, Public Policy Polling 〞 which mostly works for Democratic clients 〞 used phone interviews in a poll that showed Trump with just 9 percent support in Michigan among 957 likely voters, of whom 12 percent were African-American. The poll said none of the roughly 110 African-Americans were undecided in a two-person race, even though 8 percent said they were unsure when they were asked if they had a favorable view of Trump. In contrast, the Harper Polling survey in Pennsylvania got very different answers from African-Americans. Trump got 18.5 percent support in a four-person race, although many respondents waffled when they were asked to pick between just Clinton and Trump. When asked to pick either of the two main candidates, only 12.3 percent supported Trump, while 13.9 percent declared themselves to be undecided. So Trump actually picked up half of the undecideds when the respondents were allowed to chose from the four candidates. Polls A national poll by TIPP showed Clinton at only 75 percent support among all non-whites, including Hispanics, African-Americans and Latinos. That poll showed Trump getting support from 15 percent of non-whites , leaving 5 percent undecided and 5 percent supporting other candidates. In North Carolina, 19 percent of African-Americans support Trump, according to an Oct. 30 survey of 1176 likely voters by Remington Research Group. An Oct. 28 to Oct. 31 poll in North Carolina by SurveyUSA showed Trump with 14 percent support in a poll of 800 adults, including 659 likely voters. African-Americans comprised 21 percent of the voters in the poll. SurveyUSA is the top-ranked pollster in Nate Silvers rankings . But a late October poll of African-Americans in North Carolina by Siena University showed 89 percent support for Clinton and 1 percent for Trump 〞 but it also showed 6 percent staying they did not know who they will vote for, and 11 percent support for the GOP Gov. Pat McCrory. In Florida, a Siena University poll showed that Trump had the support of 13 percent of African-Americans. More ominously for Clinton, she had the support of only 83 percent, while 4 percent said they didnt know who to vote for. If Trump gets one-quarter of the 4 percent, he reaches 14 percent of the African-American vote, leaving Clinton with roughly 86 percent. In Virginia, a survey by Public Policy Polling taken in Nov. 3 and Nov. 4 showed Trump with 9 percent support and Clinton with 91 percent support. A Remington Research automated poll of 1,106 likely voters in Virginia showed Trump with 19 percent , and Clinton with just 78 percent support. In Georgia, a Nov. 2 to Nov. 3 poll of 1,000 likely voters showed Trump with 12 percent of the African-American vote, leaving Clinton with 85 percent. Amid the disagreement, rivalries and complexity, Bradley is confident that Trump will do well among African-Americans. His final tally as the GOP candidate will be a higher number that it has been in the past＃ [because] hes working, hes coming to these cities to deliver the message. The African-American vote may even be enough to help push Trump over the so-called blue wall of Democratic northern states that stands in his path to the White House. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

Staffers were going to put on a two-minute show over the Hudson River after the results come in on Tuesday, but the proposal has been canned, TMZ reported on Monday. The campaign called the Coast Guard last week to tell them the event was off, three days after the New York Post reported it was planning the bash  although the cancellation was secret until Monday. It emerged as fresh projections of the electoral college showed she has lost the iron grip pollsters believed she had on the 270 college votes needed for victory. CNN has moved Ohio, Utah and one district of Maine from toss-up to leaning Republican, and New Hampshire from leaning Democratic to toss-up. That changes the math significantly for Clinton, putting her projected total at 268 and Trumps at 204  with the rest of the votes to be fought over. 10 Things You Didnt Know About Hillary Clinton: Until now she had been above 270. Fox News has changed its projection too, making Utah and North Carolina toss-ups, rather than leaning towards Clinton, while Arizona and Iowa move to leaning Republican. And a series of other measures pointed to a far tighter race than some pundits had predicted. In Florida, early voting figures obtained by the Drudge Report suggested Trump was doing better than Mitt Romney, and Hillary Clinton was under-performing Barack Obama in 2012. Similarly, Drudge reported that North Carolina had seen Trump exceed early voting expectations. The figures showed Trump behind be 305,000 when Romney was behind by 447,000  a deficit which he still won the state from. The cancellation of the fireworks emerged three days after FBI director James Comey told Congress his agency was investigating a trove of emails found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The cancellation was made Thursday  before Comey wrote again to Congress to say that the FBI had not found anything to justify changing its verdict of no charges to the Democrat about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Still, Clintons campaign suffered collateral damage in the nine days which elapsed between the letters. source

Hillary Clinton was at the White Plains, New York airport about to start her day, when she exhibited some startling behavior . It was the very beginning of her day, so presumably she was rested and alert as she prepared to hit the campaign trail. Yet when speaking with the loud mob of reporters, she appeared to speak gibberish mixed in with her sentences, and laughing awkwardly even though nothing funny was being said. Then it got really weird. Shocking Video Footage Of A Confused Hillary Clinton Mumbling Gibberish On Campaign Trail 
As she walks in the direction of her personal campaign plane, she suddenly freezes and is not sure whether she needs to get into the motorcade which had just dropped her off, or board the plane like she was supposed to do.

This stands is very stark contrast to am energized Donald Trump, making nearly a dozen stops in a 24 hour period and speaking for almost an hour wherever he goes. Hillary Clinton barely has the energy to get out of her car, and when she does get out, she has no idea what to do after that.

In exactly one week from today, millions of Americans will join a mass exodus to various polling places around the nation to select new city and state officials, mayors, judges, sheriffs, congressional representatives, and of course the next President of the United States. 
However, some find themselves locked out of the process not from a lack of desire to participate, but because they have responsibilities as parents and can not find the time, or the resources, to leave their offspring alone so that they may go to the ballot box. 
With lines at some polling stations reaching up to 5 to 8 hours during the primary a few months ago, in Arizona for example, voting can be rightly seen as out of reach for those who have more to do than stand around chewing the fat with their neighbors while they wait for their turn to pull a lever. 
The YMCA has offered to do their part to help alleviate some of this inconvenience by offering free child car services on election day. The USA President and CEO of the YMCA, Kevin Washington, issued this decree : 
Election Day is arguably one of the most important days in the U.S. this year 〞 the ultimate opportunity for Americans to make their voices heard through the democratic process. Unfortunately, many people who want to vote find it challenging because they have to take children with them. The Ys hope is that Zoes Kids Day Out initiative enables those parents and caregivers to exercise their right to vote, and ensures children can spend their time in a safe, nurturing environment. 
Now not every single YMCA location across the nation is offering this fantastic service, so please be sure to check with your local chapter beforehand. 
While the YMCA deserves applause and recognition for their commitment to furthering American democracy through inclusion, what they are offering is a band-aid to a systemic problem. 
To correct this issue entirely the American people deserve election day to be a national holiday. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) proposed a bill to create Democracy Day which would codify into law the right for all Americans to have a day off to vote. Presently there are no legal requirements for employers to give their employees time off to vote, although hundreds of large corporations have voluntarily allowed their workers time to vote without fear of penalty or repercussion, but this is not enough. 
Only around 54% of eligible voters turned out to polling places in 2012, and that cannot be entirely blamed on voter apathy, but also on the reality that many do not have the time or resources to cast a ballot despite their deep desire to do participate in the democratic process. The American people deserve better, and our government must do more to ensure that everyone who wishes to vote has the ability to do exactly that.",english,2016-11-02T11:25:18.572+02:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,The YMCA Just Offered Free Election Day Childcare So Everyone Can Vote,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/hillvtrump.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

A Republican election commissioner and volunteer poll watcher has been accused of voter intimidation after he tried to drive away voters from an early-voting polling place in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The man, Stu Soffer, is a prominent Trump supporter who serves on the election commission of the majority-black Jefferson County. He has been the subject of national scrutiny before, most notably when he brandished a gun at an Election Commission meeting this Spring and then followed it up with quid-pro-quo corruption over the summer. 
Now, Soffer is facing suit in the local circuit court after Jefferson County Clerk Patricia Johnson and unrelated Pine Bluff voter Victor Johnson accused him of interfering with and intimidating voters at the Jefferson County Courthouse on October 24. According to attorney Chris Burks, who is representing Mr. Johnson, Soffer stood in the doorway of the early voting location and told voters to ＆shut up and go home. 
Johnson states in his filings that he was waiting in line at the polling place when Soffer entered with a TV reporting crew. When a county sheriff told Soffer that the TV crew was causing a disturbance and ordered one of its members to leave, Soffer apparently blocked the door to the voting booths and yelled at the assembled citizens to shut up and go home. The suit filed by Mr. Johnson states that, as a result of the disruption caused by Stu Soffer and other Republicans I was not able to cast my ballot that day. Dozens of other likely voters were apparently turned away in similar fashion. 
Soffer resigned his position as a poll watcher in the aftermath of the incident, but the suit filed on behalf of Mr. Johnson is seeking to have him removed from his position on the county election commission as well. Soffer refused to comment when contacted by local publication Arkansas Online and a hearing date is yet to be set for the case. 
This admittedly localized incident comes against a backdrop of a massive campaign of voter suppression targeting minority communities that is underway across the nation , usually justified by the chimera of voter fraud . Republican officials and commissioners, knowing that Trumps bigoted rhetoric will cost them the election in any fair vote, are using every dirty trick in the book to suppress minority turnout in a campaign of intimidation that a federal judge in North Carolina rightly characterized as insane and like something that was put together in 1901.",english,2016-11-05T05:34:14.984+02:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,"A Republican Election Official Just Blocked Door, Demanded Early Voters Shut Up, Go Home!",0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/stu.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Positive

Actually, the campaign season has felt endless. But now is not the time to drop the ball. In the days remaining, it is essential to motivate other voters who may be sitting on the fence -- or are too disgusted -- to go to the polls about why that option is not viable. Actually, it's dangerous. Their voices are crucial. Personally, it's hard for me to understand how the issue of climate change can be put on the back burner by any American. Maybe I feel the urgency so deeply because I have been writing about the environment for five years. Okay, and the mother thing definitely kicks in; wanting to protect my kid, other people's kids, and future generations. Still... it goes beyond that.

It encompasses the flooding, record temperatures, the lack of environmental justice for those who live in low-income communities, and the famines causing mass migration.

Just ask people who have been the victims of hurricanes, including New York City and environs. Homes destroyed, businesses wrecked, Manhattan subways deluged with water. Unfortunately, too many Americans still don't get how climate change is the catalyst behind the challenges -- both now and in the future -- for America's health, economy, and national security.

In the last two articles of this series we described the makeup of voters and considered the likely outcomes under a variety of different voting systems. Here we will repeat that thought-experiment but consider a different makeup of the voter attitudes. 
In the chart below, the results for the various voting systems are shown for both systems, serving both as a review and as a preview. But more importantly, the chart illustrates the difference between traditional voting systems and balanced ones. It is worth noting that in the traditional column, only Celeb (celebrity) candidates are competitive whereas in the balanced column the non-celebrity (Ghost) candidate is consistently at least competitive. Who Has a Chance of Winning(image by Paul Cohen) License DMCA 
Clearly, by these results, the balanced systems tend to be open to more candidates, and sometimes different candidates, than traditional systems. The difference stems from the fact that balanced voting systems consciously take into account both support and opposition of candidates -- whereas traditional systems only consider support. 
This election is between three candidates, two of whom are celebrities, well known by nearly all voters. Al Celeb has strong support from 35% of voters but is strongly disliked by 60%. Beth Celeb is strongly supported by 33% of the voters but very much disliked by 52%. The other candidate, Ghost, draws his support from the 12% of voters, who disapprove both of the Celeb candidates. Ghost is well regarded by the relatively small number of voters who know much about him. 
You might now take some time to think about which of the four candidates deserve to win the election. 
If the election were held using plurality voting, it is pretty clear that Al Celeb would be the winner with 35% of the vote. The fact that both Celeb candidates have more opposition than support does not matter because opposition is not a factor in traditional voting systems like plurality voting. 
On the other hand, if the election were held using balanced plurality voting , then presumably 35% of the voters would vote for Al Celeb and 33% would vote for Beth Celeb. But each of the Celeb candidates will face opposition votes as well. Al Celeb might have as much as 60% of voters casting votes against him, or as few as 48% against him if all 12% of voters who favor Al Ghost choose to vote for Ghost. So Al Celeb will have a net vote of somewhere between -13% and -35% of the voters. By the same reasoning, Beth Celeb will receive a net vote between -7% and -19% of the vote. Ghost, with between 0% and 12% of the vote will win the election. When opposition to them is taken into account, celebrity candidates lose their great advantage. - Advertisement - 
With approval voting , Al Celeb and Beth Celeb will respectively get 35% and 33% of the vote while Ghost will get only 12%. As with plurality voting, Al Celeb will be declared the winner. 
With balanced approval voting , (where the voter is asked to indicate approval or disapproval -- or neither - for each of the candidates), Al Celeb and Beth Celeb will respectively get -25% and -19% of the vote while Ghost will get 12% so Ghost will be declared the winner. 
In this election there are few enough candidates that one might question the motivation for using ration voting , but for the sake of providing an example we can consider it nonetheless. Each voter would be handed three plurality ballots (it could be more or less than that, but three seems reasonable with just three candidates). It seems likely that a Ghost voter would cast all three ballots for Ghost, giving Ghost 12% of the vote. But Al Celeb and Beth Celeb would respectively receive 35% and 33% of the vote. Al Celeb would be declared the winner. However, if sentiment among Ghost voters favored Beth Celeb over Al Celeb then some might cast some of their ballots for Beth Celeb and this could turn Beth Celeb into the winner. 
If this election were held using balanced ration voting, each voter would be handed three balanced plurality ballots. Any outcome is possible for this election, the voters have free reign to decide. This may not immediately obvious to you -- it was not to me. I had to set up a spread-sheet to try out scenarios to see this to be the case. 
It is the Ghost voters who will make the selection between the two Celeb candidates and that will be by deciding how many of their 12% of ballots will go to Celeb candidates. If 2% more of those 12% are cast against Al Celeb than are cast against Beth then the race between the Celeb candidates is a tie. Of course if more than 2% go against Al Celeb then he will lose and the contest will be between Ghost and Beth Celeb. If that margin is less than 2% then the contest will be between Ghost and Al Celeb. - Advertisement - 
Also as might be expected, whether Ghost can win will depend on how many of the Celeb voters decide to vote against the candidate they dislike (rather than for the Celeb candidate they like). If 23% of voters (Celeb voters) decide to cast votes against the Celeb candidate they dislike then the race becomes a toss-up. 
It is worth mentioning that voters will likely make these decisions according to their real feelings. They will cast votes against a candidate they dislike and they will vote for candidates they like. With balanced voting methods, voters can freely express dislike for particular candidates and that means they are not forced to resort to strategic methods to express this very real and very natural belief. 
With IRV , Celeb voters are likely to put the candidate they favor in first place on their ballots. Ghost will garner at most 12% of the vote, so Ghost will be eliminated in the first round of counting. Now the Ghost voters may all decide to not even list a second choice since that would mean voting for a candidate they dislike. The choice between the two Celeb candidates lies in the hands of these Ghost voters who do not like either of them. If just a little more than 2% more voters (necessarily these would be Ghost voters) list Beth Celeb as a second choice than those who list Al Celeb as second choice then that would give the election to Beth Celeb rather than to Al Celeb. Under IRV, the Ghost supporters would be well advised to give some serious consideration to whom they consider the lesser of the two evils. As with other traditional systems, with IRV a little-known candidate does not stand a ghost of a chance and the only real choice is apt to be between two celebrities. 
With IRBV , voters have more freedom of expression. Might any voters decide to cast their first priority against some candidate? Since there will be only two counts of the votes, some Celeb voters may well choose to cast their first-ranked choice as a vote against the Celeb they dislike. Presumably they would do that if they preferred Ghost to win rather than letting the wrong Celeb candidate winning. If enough voters choose to vote against one or the other of the Celeb candidates then Ghost actually could survive to the second round of voting and if a preference for Ghost by the voters whose Celeb candidate lost in the first round then it is quite possible for Ghost to become the winner. Under IRBV, this race is wide open with any of the three candidates having a chance to win.",english,2016-10-27T17:52:55.362+03:00,opednews.com,US,61423,Who Can Compete in Our Elections?,0,http://www.opednews.com/populum/cachedimages/s_650_opednews_com_1890_all-outcomes-png_1890_20161027-39.gif,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

I just heard an NPR presstitute declare that Texas, a traditional sure thing for Republicans was up for grabs in the presidential election. Little wonder if this report on Zero Hedge is correct. Apparently, the voting machines are already at work stealing the election for Killary. 
From my long experience in journalism, I know the American public is not very sharp. Nevertheless, it is difficult for me to believe that Americans, whose jobs, careers, and the same for their children and grandchildren, have been sold out by the elites who Hillary represents would actually vote for her. It makes no sense. If this were the case, how did Trump get the Republican nomination despite the vicious presstitute campaign against him? 
It seems obvious that the majority of Americans who have been suffering terribly at the hands of the One Percent who own Hillary lock, stock, and barrel, will not vote for the people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren. 
Furthermore, if Trump's election is as impossible as the presstitutes tell us--Hillary's win is 93% certain according to the latest presstitute pronouncement--the vicious 24/7 attacks on Trump would be pointless. Wouldn't they? Why the constant, frenetic, vicious attacks on a person who has no chance? - Advertisement - 
There are reports that a company associated with Hillary backer George Soros is supplying the voting machines to 16 states, including states that determine election outcomes. I do not know that these reports are correct. However, I do know for a fact that the oligarchic interests that rule America are opposed to Trump being elected President for the simple reason that they are unsure that they would be able to control him. 
It is hard to believe that dispossessed Americans will vote for Hillary, the representative of those who have dispossessed them, when Trump says he will re-empower the dispossessed. Hillary has denigrated ordinary Americans who, she says, she is so removed from by her wealth that she doesn't even know who they are. Clearly, Hillary, paid $675,000 by Goldman Sachs for three 20-minute speeches, is not a representative of the people. She represents the One Percent whose policies have flushed the prospects of ordinary Americans down the toilet. 
What is really disturbing is the pretense by the presstitute scum that Trump's lewd admiration for female charms is deemed more important than the prospect of nuclear war. At no time during the presidential primaries or during the current presidential campaign has it been mentioned that Russia is being assaulted daily by propaganda, threatened by military buildups, and being convinced that the United States and its European vassals are planning an attack. 
A threatened Russia, made insecure by inexplicable hostility and Western propaganda, is a danger manufactured by the neoconservative supporters of Hillary Clinton. 
If the American people are really so unbelievably stupid that they think lewd remarks about women are more important than avoiding nuclear war, the American people are too stupid to exist. They will deserve the mushroom clouds that will wipe them and everyone else off the face of the earth. - Advertisement - 
Donald Trump is the only candidate in the primaries and the general election who has said that he sees no point in conflict with Russia when Putin has shown nothing but desire to work things out to mutual advantage. 
In contrast, Hillary has declared the thrice-elected president of Russia to be ""the new Hitler"" and has threatened Russia with military action. Hillary talks openly about regime change in Russia.

The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the world's ""gold standard"" that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The ""wise men"" of the system simply insist otherwise. 
We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens' judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000). 
Strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated. 
The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nation's leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized. 
Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldn't vote). - Advertisement - 
That unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. In effect, the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern non-slave owners. 
Even after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the South, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century. 
Women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks. 
Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedy's vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the South's heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners. 
However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixon's Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960. - Advertisement - 
Nixon's ""Treason"" 
So, by 1968, the Democrats' once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didn't want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that -- with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided -- President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam.

I am now convinced that the Oligarchy that rules America intends to steal the presidential election. In the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Trump. 
Most likely you are unaware of what Trump is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this is not endeared to the oligarchs. 
Who are the oligarchs? -- Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve, a federal agency that put five banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks' balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless.
-- The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power. 
-- The neoconservatives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China. - Advertisement - 
-- The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs. 
-- Agribusiness (Monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their GMOs, hebicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops. 
-- The extractive industries -- energy, mining, fracking, and timber -- that maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply. 
-- The Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israel's way. 
What convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes' reporting and the facts on the ground. - Advertisement - 
According to the presstitutes, Hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in Trump supporters bothering to vote. Hillary has won the election before the vote. Hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner. 
I am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillary's public appearances are unattended but Trump's are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida: 
""Trump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and stickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages.""

I am currently working as hard as I can to see that Donald Trump is defeated, that Hillary Clinton is elected president, and that Democrats gain control of the US House and Senate. The day after the election, working with millions of grass-roots activists, I intend to do everything possible to make certain that the new president and Congress implement the Democratic platform, the most progressive agenda of any major political party in the history of the United States. 
That agenda includes overturning the disastrous Supreme Court decision on Citizens United, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, expanding Social Security, breaking up ""too-big-to-fail banks,"" making public colleges and universities tuition-free for the middle class, and rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. It also includes pay equity for women, a new approach toward trade, aggressive action to combat climate change, raising taxes on the wealthy and large corporations, lowering prescription drug prices, a significant movement toward universal health care, and major reforms in our criminal justice and immigration systems. 
If this election has taught us anything, it is that the American people are sick and tired of the economic, political, and media status quo. They are tired of a rigged economy in which millions work longer hours for lower wages while 52 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. They are tired of billionaires like Trump and large profitable corporations not paying a nickel in federal income taxes while the middle class pays their fair share to support governmental services. They are tired of a corrupt campaign finance system that allows billionaires like the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, and others to spend hundreds of millions to elect candidates who will represent the wealthy and the powerful. They are tired of corporate media that focus on political gossip and look at elections as personality contests, rather than provide for a serious discussion of the major crises facing our country. 
The anger and frustration of the American people, all across the political spectrum, is palpable. They want a government that represents the needs of working families and not just billionaires. They want bold action to rebuild the shrinking middle class, not inside-the-beltway palliatives written by corporate lobbyists. 
At a time of massive political discontent, when millions not only are contemptuous of the major political parties but are also actually giving up on democracy, we need a new administration that has both vision and courage. We need vision from the top to point the way toward a new America that is more inclusive and egalitarian -- which boldly addresses income and wealth inequality, poverty, and the needs of the uninsured. We need an administration that has the courage to take on the powerful special interests -- corporate America, Wall Street, the insurance and drug companies, the fossil fuel industry -- who stand in the way of real change and whose greed is destroying this country. - Advertisement - 
There is no moral excuse for the top one-tenth of 1 percent owning as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, for one family (the Waltons) having more wealth than the bottom 42 percent of our population, for the number of billionaires increasing by ten-fold since 2000 while we continue to have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any industrialized country on earth. 
There is no rational reason why we remain the only major country not to guarantee health care to all as a right or provide paid family and medical leave, or why we have more people in jail than any other country on earth at the same time as we have outrageously high levels of youth unemployment in minority communities. 
Too many Americans are living in despair and hopelessness. Too many of our brothers and sisters are turning to drugs, alcohol and suicide to avoid the painful economic realities of their lives. Too many others are turning to rage and bigotry as they try to make sense of their declining standard of living. 
At a time of hateful political division, a new president can bring our people together by leading and appointing an administration that will fight for working people. We need a secretary of treasury who is prepared to take on the greed and illegal behavior of Wall Street, not someone who comes from Wall Street or will leave office to go to Wall Street. We need a trade representative who understands that our current trade policies have failed, and that we must adopt a trade approach that represents workers and not the CEOs of large corporations. We need an attorney general who is prepared to vigorously enforce antitrust laws and prosecute bankers and corporate leaders who break the law. 
This is an historic and pivotal moment in American history. Now is the time for our next president to rally the American people against Wall Street and corporate greed and stand up vigorously for the declining middle class. - Advertisement -",english,2016-10-30T02:50:56.306+02:00,opednews.com,US,61423,Here's What I'll Do the Day After Election Day,0,https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3733/19825096471_6e6907e29c.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

It has become common in recent days, in which the 2 leading candidates for the US Presidential election have achieved unfavourable poll ratings, to regard voting for either candidate as a vote for the ""Lesser of Two Evils"" (LEV). Tempting though it may be to vote for a candidate simply in the hope of excluding another, this is a questionable ethical policy with potential risks for democracy. The ""Lesser of 2 Evils"" principle (LEV) has a long history of application in US Foreign Policy in promoting intervention in wars to exclude a ""worse evil"". So ingrained has this aspect of Realpolitik become in the US political psyche that it has become axiomatic of US public polity in the conduct of government. It has recently been promoted as such by Noam Chomsky who, in an uncharacteristically weak argument, has exhorted the left in the US to vote for Hillary Clinton. 
But Chomsky is wrong as is the political philosophy underpinning LEV which prevails as a result of its widespread acceptance in the US political Establishment and his argument exhibits many of the blind assumptions made concerning LEV. The principal area in which LEV is cited is in US Foreign Policy and a casual glance at its operation here gives a sense of the problems with it as an ethical system: Vietnam, , Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya have all been subjected to horrific bombing, invasion and military degradation by successive US governments on the basis that to do so represented the LEV. There are few today even in the US who, with the benefit of hindsight, would concur that in its application in the US Foreign Policy sphere LEV can be supported as a sound ethical principle. There are indeed, many outside of the US who would regard its support of LEV to be an evil in itself. Clearly, there are other motivations for US invasions other than LEV considerations - not least geopolitical motives - but the adherence to LEV has enabled successive US govts to conduct a programme of widespread military aggression which it would otherwise have had few means of justifying. It has come to be the primary means of justifying a brutality that is rampant in the US and which successive Presidents have subscribed to wholeheartedly with disastrous consequences for the world. 
Certainly LEV is a persuasive argument to governments facing complex issues and situations both domestically and abroad, but it is fraught with difficulties. A clear example of a sound application of LEV could be considered to be with the institution of the police force: police forces restrain liberty for the benefit of all because without them there would be a degree of lawlessness not compatible with the functioning of civilised society: it may thus be said that police forces are the LEV: a loss of liberty (evil) is incurred to avoid lawlessness (greater evil). But that brings us to the crux of the matter: LEV seems to have a reasonable application where there are 2 options and not more. If we apply it to situations were there are more than 2 options then we run into difficulty. In the case of policing it is apparent that there is no third way - or at least no-one has yet found one. LEV can therefore be safely applied in this instance. Again, in the situation where a knife-wielding madman approaching a group of school children can be disabled by running him down in a vehicle, we see an appropriate application of LEV because there seems to be no third way - and thus a great evil may be avoided by opting for a lesser evil. Were it possible to prevent the knifeman by, say, shutting the school gates, then this would remove the act of running him down from the LEV principle, because there would be 3 possibilities. If a policeman with a taser device was observed approaching then we would be in possession of a number of options: we would then have a complex moral decision to which LEV would be an unhelpful and possibly harmful remedy. That is because we would be seeking to apply a simple response to a complex problem which would potentially be detrimental and may result in a poor moral choice being made. Scaling up to the case where a conflict between the US and another country arises, there are myriad options available and by virtue of this LEV is not a good moral principle to apply. The situation in any of the recent examples of countries attacked by the US in the past 50 years has never been an either/or situation. Indeed, such situations have been subject to widespread arguments and protests concerning other options. The fact that LEV has been used to justify war, bombing, intervention etc is a testament to its misapplication rather than its wrongness as a principle per se, but given the complexity of international relations it is probably safe to regard LEV as unlikely to be applicable to most issues. 
There are also severe problems with LEV in its application in the public sphere aside from these practical considerations: 
1. By suggesting that evil can be right when it is the ""lesser evil"" it unwittingly endorses the principle of ""the end justifies the means"". This principle, which has been central to Western ethical thinking for at least 2000 years, is deeply flawed and it has - unsurprisingly - been used by many dictators as a means to justify an act, however bad, provided the ultimate outcome is good. For whom that outcome may be judged to be good, in what circumstances, by what measure and in what timescale are some of the many just criticisms of this notion of ""consequentialism"". It seems wrong intuitively for finite humans to accept such an indeterminate version of ""consequentialism"" in ethical decision making. There must be an applicability of timescale for consequences; there needs also to be a measure of the act in its intention as well as its consequence if we are to have a well balanced and sound ethical principle. By placing the matter of the ethical value of an act on the consequences alone, the intentions are effectively removed and an act is judged entirely on its outcome - it is not hard to imagine malign circumstances which have worked out well by chance. For example, if we judged a bank robbery which had gone awry by the inadvertent consequence of uncovering a stash of terrorist weapons in the bank vault, we may be pleased to have discovered the plot, but we would hardly be likely to applaud the robbers. It does seem that the consequence must, at the very least, be intended and it seems reasonable to argue that the end of a moral act cannot be the sole measure of its value - of course there is also a practical difficulty in that by the time the outcome of many acts can be weighed against the acts themselves, it is no longer of much practical use to do so! In such cases we must rely heavily on intention . 
2. LEV involves another major problem: if both options consist of evil consequences it could only be justifiable to select one on the basis that there was no other choice . If there were other choices available then it may be argued that the LEAST evil choice was the ethical option, although the introduction of a third element would cause exponential difficulties because it would introduce other considerations such as expediency, practicality and judgements concerning relative likelihood of successful outcome. Where LEV is applied to multiple choice complex situations involving moral decisions, it is therefore a crass and inappropriate response to a situation, since it simplifies and deliberately excludes other possible solutions. - Advertisement - 
3. LEV also requires heavy qualification because it is frequently used as an excuse to justify doing evil, rather than considering other options - thus in this sense it is an unethical principle when inappropriately applied. LEV must be applied to dire exigencies by its very nature for if the exigency were not urgent then action would hardly be necessary. We should also be careful to ensure that situations are properly identified as LEV situations. If we take the situation where I am in a lifeboat and there is room for only one other passenger apart from myself and there is an old man in the water and a child - which of these should I save? The other must drown. Certainly there are 2 evils present and prima facie we have a LEV situation, but on closer examination we see that there are undoubtedly other options available - I may give up my own place to them both and accept my own drowning, or I may try to accommodate both even though we may all drown and accept the increased risk of this etc. There are a number of judgements here which must be made and which affect the decision - judgements based on assumptions of what will happen; that one is more worthy of saving than the other and so forth: it is thus a complex moral decision which will require a difficult choice but is deserving of a complex consideration for that reason. Given that such decisions would be unusual in the extreme and that we would be required to act quickly rather than to sit in the boat considering the matter while both drowned, it is unlikely that the impact on the world would be great! Certainly it does not assume the great impact that LEV takes on in its application in the Public sphere where large numbers of people are affected. 
This brings us to the use of LEV in democratic elections and it proves to be as dubious in its application here as it is in its use in Foreign affairs. Representative democracy is dependent on the notion of freedom of choice so that the best candidate may be elected. Anything which inhibits this undermines that principle. LEV, by its very nature, does so: rather than promoting contest between the best in the freest manner possible, it promotes the least bad option from a narrow choice, constraining and distorting the freedom of choice of the voter. That is a denial of democratic principle; if it is applied when there are other choices available, that distortion becomes even greater so that we may justly inquire whether the limited form of democracy we possess in its representative form is worthy of the name democracy at all. We should also consider that democratic elections require myriad assumptions and judgements to be made and are not therefore susceptible (nor should they be) to evil and ""less evil"" considerations. Furthermore, b ecause ethical values are by no means clear in themselves or invested simply in one candidate or another, then such judgements made are themselves complex and deserving of such treatment. 
Noam Chomsky, with John Halle, has argued that LEV should be used in the 2016 US Presidential election and his argument is worthy of examination: Chomsky provides some general caveats by way of providing a soft-landing for his assumption of LEV and these are deeply flawed. First, to the argument that Clinton's Foreign Policy may be worse than Trump's, he advances the claim that ""following the logic through seems to require a vote for Trump""! That is an astonishing non-sequitur! It makes no such requirment and can be used simply as a means of eviscerating the claims that Clinton IS the LEV in this respect, without leading to an endorsement of Trump in the wider aspect. It may equally contribute to a decision to abstain from voting or to vote for a 3rd party. 
Second, he refers to ""The politics of moral witness"" (the argument that LEV remains evil and should not be engaged) which he counters by stating that the point of voting for LEV is to do ""Less"" evil which is an ""obvious rejoinder"". Perhaps it may seem so, but it is a ""circulus in demonstrandum"" type of fallacy to make such a criticism! It only seems right to someone who is already signed up to the notion of LEV - but to others it is simply evincing a premise as a proof of that which it seeks to confirm! 
Thirdly, Chomsky goes on to state ""The basic moral principle at stake is simple: not only must we take responsibility for our actions, but the consequences of our actions for others are a more important consideration than feeling good about ourselves"". The first proposition is good - the second half has strayed from its purpose somewhat: it appears in part to try to lessen the effect of personal responsibility by stating that consequences should be regarded as more important than intentions. That is a dangerous argument. Even at a common sense level intention is given great value in human relations - often to the detriment of consequences: and this is right, because as we have seen, consequences by their nature are often unpredictable and involve many assumptions, prejudices and involve many matters not always relevant to the decision itself. ""I will bomb Iraq because it will lead to a safer world and rid us and its people of an evil regime"" (I purposely introduce a contentious and familiar issue here) plays out like this: my intention is good, but I have introduced some assumptions which involve great leaps of faith and logic: ie, the consequence of bombing (bad) in producing a safe world (good) justifies my action. We can see very easily where such an argument goes awry in its practical and recent application in human history. It is not safe or justifiable to take arguments beyond their remit. Viewed by intention alone the decision may be seen as good or bad depending on one's point of view; by the consequences alone (deaths of many innocent people, destruction of a nation and its infrastructure) it is clearly an evil: does this imply that had the outcome of the war been good the war would have been a good one? It seems that the intention must play heavily on the judgement and a proper balance must be observed between intention and consequence in judging the action, especially as we could not possibly know the outcome. Of course we are setting aside the notion that Iraq was not a true LEV situation since there were actions which could be taken which were considerably less evil, but the example serves to demonstrate that intention and consequence cannot easily be separated in weighing the ethical value of an action. Therefore it seems fair to alter Chomsky's proposition to ""We must take responsibility for our actions which should have intrinsic good as their basis and CONSIDER the consequences as a corollary to this"". That is as far as an ethical argument can take us. - Advertisement - 
A final criticism of LEV, says Chomsky, is equating it with ""passive acquiescence to the bipartisan status quo"" and he attacks this by stating that LEV can be defended by the fact that ""poorly considered electoral decisions impose a cost"" and then goes on to give some subjective examples of Nixon's continuation of the Vietnam war. But this is unjustifiable by the same measures we have considered in applying assumptions and prejudices to previous arguments, for it can quite as easily be argued that an alternative to Nixon MIGHT have produced a different adminsitration; indeed, that it MIGHT have produced an alternative ending to the Vietnam war - but it might not: recent US history is not over-filled with instances in which different electoral results produced different policies! In the case of Vietnam it can be argued that the war was a war of the US Establishment - and surely no-one prosecuted that war with greater vigour and determination than democrat President LBJ? The difficulty with such examples is that we move into the realms of pure speculation in guessing what the alternative might have been. We could equally claim that the 1968 outcome may have averted nuclear war due to the initiation of the SALT negotiations by Nixon - but we should not do so, because to bring such unknowns which are dependent on so many different variables into the equation, takes us into the arena of pure political speculation and little else. 
Critique of Chomsky's 8-point argument: 
1) ""Voting should not be directed as a form of personal self-expression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values, or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites."" 
The immediate response to this is to ask: ""Is not it a matter for my personal integrity to choose my reason for voting?"" Surely my reasons for voting (or not doing so) should be determined by my view of the system, the candidates and other matters and it should not be dictated to me that I must vote, in any circumstances, whosoever the candidates may be?"" There may be very good reasons why a voter may wish to vote for a candidate including those of moral, social or personal affinity and such reasons should be respected as legitimate - even though I may have my own personal view of why and how people should vote. It seems perfectly reasonable to vote as a means of self-expression, moral judgement or even of disapprobation towards one or more candidates and certainly as part of the calculation in making a judgement as to who to vote for. Chomsky's personal injunction here is no more than an expression of his personal preference and has no validity beyond that, evinces no proof in support of its validity and is of questionable morality.",english,2016-10-30T15:53:53.328+02:00,opednews.com,US,61423,The Lesser of Two Evils: why Noam Chomsky is wrong in advocating this principle in the 2016 US Presidential Election,0,http://www.opednews.com/populum/cachedimages/s_650_opednews_com_57353_lesserevil--2--jpg_57353_20161027-192.gif,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Negative

That's why privacy is so important to all of us, even if we have something to hide. We can be blackmailed because we love someone who has something to hide. Remember, Ed Snowden was able to access the information. Actually, there may be thousands of private contractors-- employees of big corporations-- who have access to all or part of the massive data trove. There's even a name for one of the things they do. Remember, ""Sig-Int"" is the term used to refer to signal intelligence-- anything that can be picked up electronically. These contractors and intelligence agency officers engage in what is called ""love-Int,"" basically spying on wives and girlfriends to find out if they are cheating. The abuse of the system is dangerously, rampantly out of control. The recent disclosures of nebulous information about Hillary Clinton's emails are an outrageous, screamingly transparent effort to influence the election. There is no way to justify the timing. This is just the latest stretching beyond the boundaries by an intelligence agency leader. It has to stop. FBI head Comey should be charged with whatever laws apply which relate to using government power to unlawfully influence elections. It is clear that the FBI as well as the NSA, which surely has had all of the missing emails all along, have used their control over and selective analysis of them to influence the election. This should not have happened. It can never happen again. The presidency of the United States must not be determined by the head or heads of a spy agency. And it looks like that's what we're seeing. Whether you support Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, this process should be horrifying to you. - Advertisement -",english,2016-10-30T15:53:58.078+02:00,opednews.com,US,61423,"Who Will Win The Election?

In an extraordinary and unprecedented action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has stepped into the 2016 presidential campaign only 11 days before Election Day, sending a letter to Congress announcing new ""investigative steps"" related to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. 
The three-paragraph letter by FBI Director James Comey to eight congressional committees on Friday is remarkably vague. It states that ""in connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation"" of Clinton's personal email server, which, Comey notes, he had previously told Congress was ""completed."" 
He states that he has agreed to ""allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation."" He acknowledges that the FBI ""cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant."" 
The obvious question that arises is why, given the fact that the FBI has no idea whether these additional emails contain any significant information relative to the Clinton email case, the agency should make them a public issue within days of the election. Media commentators noted that the letter violates a longstanding informal FBI ban on making politically sensitive announcements within 60 days of a US election. 
Following the report of Comey's letter, the news media, citing unnamed federal law enforcement officials, said the emails in question were found on a laptop computer shared by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband, former Representative Anthony Weiner. - Advertisement - 
Weiner is under FBI investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to an underage girl. Abedin announced her separation from Weiner earlier this year after the latest episode involving Weiner and sexually explicit Internet activity became public. 
Comey's letter was hailed by Donald Trump and Republican Party spokesmen as tantamount to an official reopening of the FBI investigation and rescinding of the decision announced by Comey in July that no charges would be brought against the Democratic presidential candidate. 
Clinton spoke to the press briefly Friday evening, demanding that the FBI provide more information about the substance of what it was reviewing, including whether there was any connection to her use of a private email server. She pointed out that more than 15 million people have already voted and that many millions more will be going to the polls over the next week as early voting continues. In response to questions, she indicated that the FBI has not contacted her and that she first learned of the letter through the media. 
It is at this point impossible to determine with precision the motivation behind Comey's letter and the political forces for which he is speaking. However, his attempt to present the letter as a politically disinterested response to the discovery of new information lacks any credibility. 
This direct intervention into the election by the top police-intelligence agency can only be an expression of deep crisis and profound tensions within the American ruling class and the state. The election as a whole has been dominated by the growth of social anger and anti-establishment sentiment, yet it has ended in a contest between two right-wing representatives of the richest 1 percent who are despised by huge sections of the electorate. - Advertisement - 
It has plumbed the depths of political debasement on the part of both candidates -- the fascistic billionaire Trump seeking to channel discontent along the most right-wing, chauvinist and racist channels; the multimillionaire Clinton relying on sex scandals and a McCarthyite attack on Trump as an agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin to bury incriminating revelations of corruption and lying and to swing public opinion behind a policy of military escalation and confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. 
The entire process has been surrounded by an aura of violence and a breakdown of public confidence in the political system. It has unfolded under conditions of deepening economic crisis, mounting international tensions and worsening crises for US imperialism around the world, i.e., the ongoing debacle of Washington's war for regime change in Syria, the signs of disarray in the anti-Chinese ""pivot to Asia,"" the emergence of open conflicts with imperialist ""allies"" in Europe, particularly Germany. 
The convergence of these crises is generating bitter conflicts within the American ruling class over policy questions, magnified by fears of a rising tide of social opposition at home. 
Whether the intention of Comey's letter was to inflict fatal damage to Clinton's candidacy, shore up endangered Republican majorities in the Senate and House, or fire a shot across the bow against an incoming Clinton administration, it makes clear that the next administration will be mired in crisis from the day it takes office.",english,2016-10-31T05:21:09.467+02:00,opednews.com,US,61423,The FBI intervenes in the 2016 election,0,http://www.opednews.com/populum/cachedimages/s_650_atlantablackstar_com_35991_James-Comey-1-e1475104883804-300x199.gif,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Neutral
