Democrat Dr. Brenda Snipes was appointed by Jeb Bush in 2003 and is no stranger to controversy. On October 20, the Sun Sentinal reported that former Oakland Park Commissioner Anne Sallee noticed something troubling about her vote-by-mail ballot. It is missing Constitutional Amendment 2, the medical marijuana question. 
Sallee, now Broward chapter director of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, knows her way around government. Yet she said she spent a week unsuccessfully trying to get someone at the Broward elections office to pay attention to her complaint. 
She was cleared on Wednesday of another election snafu, the early posting of primary election results. Her office also was criticized for sending out inaccurate voter ID cards, and for printing ballots for November that include the word â€œnoâ€?in the â€œyesâ€?line on the countyâ€™s transportation sales surtax question.

She put our national security at grave risk by leaving top classified emails on her private server, and she took money from nations who throw gays off rooftops and treat women worse than cockroaches. She is likely very sick and would be unlikely to serve out her first term without someone there to prop her up, but nevertheless, I supported her anyhow, because sheâ€™s a Democrat and has a vagina. Someone told me she still has a chance of winning the presidency if I just signed a petition. They said that Trump really didnâ€™t win, because Hillary won the popular vote. Is that true? 
Okay, letâ€™s address this â€œHillary might win the popular vote, isnâ€™t that Electoral College situation just awfulâ€?thing head on. 
No, itâ€™s not awful. Itâ€™s great, and it protects the importance of your vote. Itâ€™s also uniquely American and demonstrates yet again the once-in-creation brilliance of the Founding Fathers. 
First of all, sheâ€™s probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. 
States donâ€™t count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldnâ€™t influence the election results, then the absentee ballots arenâ€™t counted. 
Who votes by absentee ballot? Students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. The historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 67-33% Republican. In 2000, when Al Gore â€œwonâ€?the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone. A 67-33 breakout of those yields a 1.33- to 0.667-million Republican vote advantage, so Bush would have gotten a 667,000-vote margin from Californiaâ€™s uncounted absentee ballots alone! So much for Goreâ€™s 500,000 popular vote â€œvictory.â€?(That was the headline on the N.Y. Times, and it was the lead story on NBC Nightly News, right? No? Youâ€™re kidding.) 
Getting back to the â€œwin the popular vote/lose the Electoral Collegeâ€?scenario: Thank G-d we have that, or else California and N.Y. would determine every election. Every time. 
But the Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. Farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. 
Shortcomings? Sure. The E.C. can make an R vote meaningless in a very few heavily D states or vice versa. But without the Electoral College, the countryâ€™s entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states. â€?American Thinker Comment on this Article Via Your Facebook Account Comment on this Article Via Your Disqus Account Follow Us on Facebook!",english,2016-11-13T06:02:47.949+02:00,100percentfedup.com,US,25689,SORRY LIBERALSâ€¦You Can Stop With The Petitionsâ€¦Hillary Did NOT Win The Popular Vote,0,http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2546106-thumb.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bias,Negative

(AP Photo / Dennis System) 
COLUMBUS, OH (AP) â€?History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November. 
The organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee. 
The Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they donâ€™t vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process. 
â€œOver the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,â€?said AAB chairman Menno Simons. â€œWe have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage. Now, they want to put a woman in the nationâ€™s highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 Timothy 2:12. We need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lordâ€™s way.â€?
According to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote. 
â€œThe Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,â€?Silver noted. â€œThey also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.â€?
The Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision. 
â€œI donâ€™t believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,â€?Clinton wrote to the AAB. â€œAs a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.â€?
Most pundits believe that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s plea is too little too late. 
During a press conference in Manhattan, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because â€œthe Amish do great work for a very low price.â€?
Though Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff over the next two weeks. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses. 
â€œIt looked like she was going to win this election easily,â€?said Paul Horner, a campaign worker in Ohio, â€œBut this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Cleary, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. Itâ€™s really sad to see the campaign end this way.â€?

(AP Photo / Dennis System) 
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) â€?Following the results of Tuesday nightâ€™s election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19 th . Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. 
â€œPeople all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,â€?Obama told reporters. â€œMany have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.â€?
Under the Presidentâ€™s order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesdayâ€™s election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. 
Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the presidentâ€™s decision. 
â€œCrooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didnâ€™t allow that to happen. President Obama doesnâ€™t care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.â€?
The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. 
â€œWe have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.â€?
Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. 
â€œMost people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes , but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19 th . What the people are actually voting for are their statesâ€?electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.â€?
Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the Presidentâ€™s Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. 
â€œ[The electoral college] is a fâ€”king joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise . Everyone should have an equal vote, and thatâ€™s just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. Itâ€™s time to bring our system into the 21 st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.â€?
Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. 
â€œWeâ€™re going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,â€?Obama said. â€œWhy did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasnâ€™t this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?â€?Obama said. â€œIf all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.â€?
If you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19 th election , you can call the Obama administrationâ€™s special election hotline at (785) 273-0325.

""Concern Grows Over Soros-Linked Voting Machines   
Sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  
by Edmund Kozak | Updated 24 Oct 2016 at 5:21 PM  
Concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist George Soros and his personal quest to create a nationless, borderless global state. 

The U.K.-based Smartmatic company posted a flow-chart on its website that it had provided voting machines for 16 states, including important battleground states like Florida and Arizona. Smartmatic Chairman Mark Malloch-Brown is a former U.N. official and sits on the board of Sorosâ€?Open Society Foundations. Since the story first broke, the flow-chart has disappeared from Smartmaticâ€™s website, raising further questions about the real status of the Soros-tied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in U.S. elections. 

If Malloch-Brown's Soros ties weren't troubling enough, he also has ties to the Clintons through his work at two consulting firms. 

According to a spokesperson for the National Association of Secretaries of State, Smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several statesâ€?have contested that their equipment came from Smartmatic. Why, then, had Smartmatic bragged about providing over 50,000 voting machines for U.S. elections?""

""BREAKING: @HillaryClinton's E-Mail Server Company Got Almost $1 Million In Gov't Loans After Wiping E-Mails   
OCTOBER 26, 2016  
BY CHARLES C. JOHNSON 6 COMMENTS  
Give it up already. It's over. K. J. Gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story. 

Hillary Clinton's e-mail server company got almost $1 million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe Hillary Clinton's name from her e-mails. 

Platte River Networks (PRN) got a $493,000 loan from the Small Business Administration in August 2014 and another $350,000 loan in September 2015: 

Public government data available as USAspending.gov 

The first half-million dollar loan arrived not one month after PRN employee Paul Combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at Hillary's request in July 2014 . 

The second $350,000 loan came about one year later.

After getting the first loan, PRN moved to a large office space after previously working out of the ownerâ€™s condo. The head of the Small Business Administration is Maria Contreras-Sweet , a Mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by Barack Obama two months before Hillary's PRN got the first loan. 

WikiLeaks leaks have proven Hillary's corrupt pay-to-play scheme. GotNews has shined a light on how Hillary gets favors from Hispanic and Democratic government bureaucrats before . 

Did Hillary Clinton pay her e-mail server company Platte River Networks (PRN) with almost $1 million in favorable government loans â€?given out by a political friendly â€?in order to alter her illegal e-mails and get her name off them? 

It sure looks like it.

""WHY BILL CLINTON'S 26 TRIPS ON THE LOLITA EXPRESS CHILD RAPE JET MATTER May 15, 2016  
Daniel Greenfield   
We don't know what Bill Clinton did or didn't do in company with Jeffrey Epstein. But we certainly know what Epstein did and, almost as outrageously, what he got away with doing . 

Some of the most shocking allegations against Epstein surfaced only after the conclusion of an FBI probe, in civil suits brought by his victims: for example, the claim that three 12-year-old French girls were delivered to him as a birthday present. But the feds did identify roughly 40 young women, most of them underage at the time, who described being lured to Epstein's Palm Beach home on the pretense of giving a ""massage"" for money, then pressured into various sex acts, as well as the ""Balkan sex slave"" Epstein allegedly boasted of purchasing from her family when she was just 14. More recently, a big cash payment from Mail on Sunday coaxed one of Epstein's main accusers out of anonymity to describe what she claims were her years as a teenage sex toy. This victim, Virginia Roberts, produced a photo of herself with Prince Andrew in 2001 and reported that Epstein paid her $15,000 to meet the prince. Then 17 years old, she claims that she was abused by Epstein and ""loaned"" to his friends from the age of 15. 

Sex crimes of the kind Roberts alleges took place typically carry a term of 10 to 20 years in federal prison. Yet when all was said and done, Epstein served his scant year-plus-one-month in a private wing of the Palm Beach jail and was granted a 16-hour-per-day free pass to leave the premises for work. 

In short, Epstein was never actually in jail. During his ""house arrest,"" he flew around the country on his jets from his New York City place to his private island. At least one of Epstein's victims claimed to have met Bill Clinton. And it turns out that Bill Clinton was a much more regular passenger on the Lolita Express. 

Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender's infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the ""Lolita Express"" -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. 

Clinton's presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein's Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including ""Tatiana."" The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls. 

It doesn't help that the Democratic establishment seems to have played a role in getting Epstein a pass on child rape, that Bill Clinton already had rape accusations in his past or that the Clintons had become notorious for their willingness to do favors for criminals in exchange for money. 

Either way we've come a long way from Gary Hart being bounced for ""Monkey Business"" to Bill Clinton flying around on a child rapist's plane without anyone in the media seeming to care much about it. 

Social conservatives often get a bad rap. But there really is no limit to how low standards can fall when any trace of a moral code vanishes out the window. What did Bill Clinton actually do? Who knows. More importantly these days, who cares

Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam."" 

""For sure, defence counsel have made much of Taylor's involvement with the missing and murdered women, all but pointing the finger at her as homicidal maniac, the real killer. What's not in dispute is that Taylor is one scary character ? street-hardened, menacing, a procurer of prostitutes lured to the Pickton farm, contemptuous of both sex-trade workers (especially street walkers) and drug addicts. 

""She's pure evil,'' says one outreach worker, who asked that her name not be used in any story about Taylor. 

... 

Court has heard that Taylor's DNA was found on 113 items retrieved from the Pickton property ? including handcuffs, condoms, clothing, syringes ? and also on items that belonged to some victims ? Brenda Wolfe's lipstick, Mona Wilson's rosary. 

One witness, Pickton pal Pat Casanova, told the court he once received fellatio from a woman he knew as ""Angel,"" who'd been brought to the farm by Taylor. He said he gave the money to Taylor, who shared some of it with ""Angel."" 

Another witness, Gina Houston, put Taylor on the same bed with victim Sereena Abotsway, in Pickton's trailer. 

In his lengthy police interview, Pickton repeatedly tells police he wants to speak with Taylor. 

On the stand, Houston recounted a conversation she'd had with Pickton about Taylor, shortly before his arrest. 

""Willie told me that he believed she (Taylor) would do the right thing when she came back. That she would take responsibility for what she said she would take responsibility for.""

Jeff Wells points to other odd things. 

A week or so ago a man called Steve Remian committed suicide-by-cop but: The name ""Steve Remian"" surfaced at the Robert ""Willie"" Pickton murder trial in New Westminster, B.C., last March, when jurors were told that Remian's name ? with a Burnaby, B.C., address ? was on the label of a suitcase packed into a box found in Pickton's workshop. 

In April, jurors heard further evidence that DNA testing on two hairs found on a Hudson's Bay blanket removed from Pickton's motorhome linked one to Pickton, and the other to a ""Steve Remian."" 

A source involved in the Oakville shooting investigation told the Star that the man shot by police had been charged with sexual assault earlier in life while living in Oakville, but had been acquitted, although a co-accused was convicted.

It does seem like a regular hive of activity: Robert Pickton's pig farm was a constant buzz of activity, with people and vehicles coming and going all the time, a woman who lived in Pickton's trailer for a time testified on Wednesday. 

Tanya Carr, 35, told the jury in Pickton's murder trial that people were coming and going all day long at the Port Coquitlam, B.C., farm and it wasn't unusual for people to show up late at night looking for Pickton or his brother Dave.

Also there are those Hells Angels and the ""Piggy Palace"": 

""It was a rough crowd"" at Piggy's Palace, said Brian, a musician who played there a few years ago with the hard-rock band South City Slam. 

The nightclub, he said, was inside an old building on a property Dave Pickton and his brother Robert own at 2552 Burns Rd., near their pig farm on Dominion Road in Port Coquitlam.... 

""Even the women were tough- looking -- a lot of leather and denim. It wasn't a cocktail-gown kind of place ,"" he recalled. 

Brian, who didn't want his last name used, recalled that there was a coat-check girl and a sign saying, ""Check your knives and other weapons at the door."" ... 

The crowd at Piggy's Palace often included men wearing Hells Angels biker club colours. 

""They were there a lot,"" said Brian. ""The people who came all seemed to know one another.""

""July 7, 2016 Developments in PKI occurred in the early 1970s at the British intelligence agency GCHQ , where James Ellis , Clifford Cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution.[ 19 ] However, as developments at GCHQ are highly classified, the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mid-1990s. 

The public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in 1976 by Diffie, Hellman , Rivest, Shamir , and Adleman changed secure communications entirely. With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting. 

Assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used. With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread, the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute. Commercial reasons alone (e.g., e-commerce, online access to proprietary databases from web browsers) were sufficient. Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol ('https' in Web URLs); it included key establishment, server authentication (prior to v3, one-way only), and so on. A PKI structure was thus created for Web users/sites wishing secure communications. 

Vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market, started companies (or new projects at existing companies), and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability. An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations (see ABA digital signature guidelines), and shortly thereafter, several U.S. states (Utah being the first in 1995) and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations. Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others. 

The enacted laws and regulations differed, there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation, and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be. 

By the first few years of the 21st century, the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly. Operating procedures (manual or automatic) were not easy to correctly design (nor even if so designed, to execute perfectly, which the engineering required). The standards that existed were insufficient. 

PKI vendors have found a market, but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid-1990s, and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated.[20] PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to, and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others. PKI has had the most success in government implementations; the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program.""

""Concern Grows Over Soros-Linked Voting Machines   
Sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  
by Edmund Kozak | Updated 24 Oct 2016 at 5:21 PM  
Concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist George Soros and his personal quest to create a nationless, borderless global state. 

The U.K.-based Smartmatic company posted a flow-chart on its website that it had provided voting machines for 16 states, including important battleground states like Florida and Arizona. Smartmatic Chairman Mark Malloch-Brown is a former U.N. official and sits on the board of Sorosâ€?Open Society Foundations. Since the story first broke, the flow-chart has disappeared from Smartmaticâ€™s website, raising further questions about the real status of the Soros-tied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in U.S. elections. 

If Malloch-Brown's Soros ties weren't troubling enough, he also has ties to the Clintons through his work at two consulting firms. 

According to a spokesperson for the National Association of Secretaries of State, Smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several statesâ€?have contested that their equipment came from Smartmatic. Why, then, had Smartmatic bragged about providing over 50,000 voting machines for U.S. elections?""

Starnet CEO heads to court; hiring continues; sweet deals in Antigua   
Friday Aug 27 1999  
by Brent Mudry  
CEO SEEKS TO BLOCK ACCESS TO SENSITIVE RECORDS 

In the first legal challenge to the Starnet Communications International police raid, Starnet chief executive Mark Dohlen has launched a court action seeking to assert solicitor-client privilege over certain documents and records seized during searches of Starnet's corporate headquarters and his personal residence a week ago. In a motion filed Thursday in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, prominent Vancouver criminal defence lawyer Ian Donaldson seeks to block police access to sensitive records seized by members of the RCMP and the Co-ordinated Law Enforcement Unit on Aug. 20. 

Certain disputed files have been sealed in court pending resolution of the privilege claim. An initial court hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday morning on the search warrant challenge. 

HIRING SPREE SEEKS PORN-PEDDLER, OTHERS 

In an unrelated Starnet matter, the Vancouver-based Internet gambling and pornography company appears eager to mount a new hiring spree, recruiting staff in numerous positions, including its porn division, which it hopes to quickly sell off. 

In a large ad on Thursday in The Georgia Straight, a Vancouver weekly entertainment newspaper, Starnet is soliciting a marketing representative for its entertainment division, amongst numerous other posted jobs. ""Do you have the ability to 'think outside the curve'?,"" Starnet asks in its porn-peddler posting. The company states that this position requires strategic thinking and implementation, directly relating to Redlight.com and Adultv.com. 

Queasy web-surfers may want to take a pass on these sites, at least Redlight.com, which offers a much harder-core home page than Starnet's main porn sites, Sizzler.com and Chisel.com. Redlight.com's home page offers an extremely explicit mix of ""teaser"" shots, including a graphic live-sex video clip. While Starnet wants to dump its porn business, its latest ad seeks a marketer to maintain continual market research of new forms of advertising and demographics, with ""overall participation in the team effort."" The Thursday recruitment ad came three days after Starnet's Monday disclosure that it hopes to quickly auction off its adult entertainment division assets, with documentation to be complete in 30 days. 

This Redlight.com site happens to be the same Starnet site targeted by the police in their proposed single criminal count of adult pornography. While no charges have yet been laid against Starnet or any directors or employees, the ""information to obtain,"" a court-filed document supporting the search warrant, notes eight proposed counts, including one of possession, for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation, computerized pictures depicting obscene acts. The police note that ""Fetish,"" one of Redlight.com's seven sections, shows 84 images of nude bondage, women with clamps on body parts, women with horse bridles and bits in their mouths, and women hanging by their arms from straps or belts. 

The latest Starnet recruitment ad also suggests it is ""business as usual"" at Starnet, despite the week-ago raid by more than 100 officers from the RCMP, CLEU, the Ontario Provincial Police, the United States Customs Service and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. 

The Georgia Straight ad seeks a WorldBroadcasts.com manager, an Internet marketing manager, HTML programmers, graphic designers, an investor relations administrative assistant, an adminstrative assistant of production and sports odds analysts. Starnet seeks ""open-minded, innovative people who enjoy working in a dynamic, fun, team atmosphere and are able to work creatively under pressure."" 

""BREAKING: @HillaryClinton's E-Mail Server Company Got Almost $1 Million In Gov't Loans After Wiping E-Mails   
OCTOBER 26, 2016  
BY CHARLES C. JOHNSON 6 COMMENTS  
Give it up already. It's over. K. J. Gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story. 

Hillary Clinton's e-mail server company got almost $1 million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe Hillary Clinton's name from her e-mails. 

Platte River Networks (PRN) got a $493,000 loan from the Small Business Administration in August 2014 and another $350,000 loan in September 2015: 

Public government data available as USAspending.gov 

The first half-million dollar loan arrived not one month after PRN employee Paul Combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at Hillary's request in July 2014 . 

The second $350,000 loan came about one year later.

After getting the first loan, PRN moved to a large office space after previously working out of the ownerâ€™s condo. The head of the Small Business Administration is Maria Contreras-Sweet , a Mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by Barack Obama two months before Hillary's PRN got the first loan. 

WikiLeaks leaks have proven Hillary's corrupt pay-to-play scheme. GotNews has shined a light on how Hillary gets favors from Hispanic and Democratic government bureaucrats before . 

Did Hillary Clinton pay her e-mail server company Platte River Networks (PRN) with almost $1 million in favorable government loans â€?given out by a political friendly â€?in order to alter her illegal e-mails and get her name off them? 

It sure looks like it.

""Police conclude search of Starnet   
CBC News Posted: Aug 24, 1999 11:26 AM ET Last Updated: Aug 24, 1999 11:26 AM ET  
Police have wrapped up several days of searching the offices of Starnet Communications in Vancouver. They entered the company offices and homes of some directors on Friday. 

Police were looking for evidence of illegal gambling, distributing child pornography, and money laundering. Since the raid, Starnet officials say police just don't understand their business. 

The search warrant details 18 months of police investigation. It traces a network of companies registered in American and Caribbean jurisdictions. 

The warrant also identifies Vancouver as the centre of Starnet's operations, even though this is a grey under Canadian law. 

Police note that Starnet's revenues grew dramatically in the past two years, from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software. The investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for Friday's raid and seizure of company materials. 

RCMP Constable Peter Thiessen says investigators left Starnet offices yesterday morning. He says, ""They spent the better part of three days going through the business. And as a result of that search the investigation is continuing, but no charges have been laid."" Starnet's many investors were spooked by the raid. Share prices dropped almost 70-percent on Friday. However, the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation. Stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading. 

In written statements, company CEO Mark Dohlen said the Wall Street Journal calls Starnet the leader in Internet gaming and entertainment. He says companies like his, those on the cutting edge, are often misunderstood. Yesterday, Starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business. It plans to focus more resources on gaming. 

The Police investigation is expected to last for several more months.""

""UK Cabinet Office â€?Emergency Planning College â€?Serco â€?.Types of Exercise Workshop Exercises These are structured discussion events where participants can explore issues in a less pressurised environment. They are an ideal way of developing solutions, procedures and plans rather than the focus being on decision making. Table Top Exercises These involve a realistic scenario and will follow a time line, either in real-time or with time jumps to concentrate on the more important areas. The participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness. Simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise. Table-top exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations. Command/Control Post Exercises These are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping. Ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations and using their communications and information systems [Feeling lucky, Punk?] . This could include a mix of locations and varying levels of technical simulation support. The Gold Standard system is flexible to allow the tempo and intensity to be adjusted to ensure maximum training benefit, or to fully test and evaluate the most important aspects of a plan. Such exercises also test information flow, communications, equipment, procedures, decision making and coordination. Live Exercises These can range from testing individual components of a system or organisation through to a full-scale rehearsal. They are particularly useful where there are regulatory requirements or with high-risk situations. They are more complex and costly to organise and deliver but can be integrated with Command Post Exercises as part of a wider exercising package.""

""July 7, 2016 Developments in PKI occurred in the early 1970s at the British intelligence agency GCHQ , where James Ellis , Clifford Cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution.[ 19 ] However, as developments at GCHQ are highly classified, the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mid-1990s. 

The public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in 1976 by Diffie, Hellman , Rivest, Shamir , and Adleman changed secure communications entirely. With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting. 

Assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used. With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread, the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute. Commercial reasons alone (e.g., e-commerce, online access to proprietary databases from web browsers) were sufficient. Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol ('https' in Web URLs); it included key establishment, server authentication (prior to v3, one-way only), and so on. A PKI structure was thus created for Web users/sites wishing secure communications. 

Vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market, started companies (or new projects at existing companies), and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability. An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations (see ABA digital signature guidelines), and shortly thereafter, several U.S. states (Utah being the first in 1995) and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations. Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others. 

The enacted laws and regulations differed, there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation, and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be. 

By the first few years of the 21st century, the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly. Operating procedures (manual or automatic) were not easy to correctly design (nor even if so designed, to execute perfectly, which the engineering required). The standards that existed were insufficient. 

PKI vendors have found a market, but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid-1990s, and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated.[20] PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to, and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others. PKI has had the most success in government implementations; the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program.""

Conservatives claim that voter ID is necessary to catch illegal voters, but it turns out theyâ€™re the only ones creating fake IDs to use on Election Day. 
Trump supporters are taking Trumpâ€™s call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake ID badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them, confusing them, and filming them â€?all of which are illegal. 
But, Trumpâ€™s deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a right-wing group known as â€œVote Protectors.â€?
The group, which is affiliated with top Trump ally Roger Stone, is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on Election Day. They are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes. 
According to the Huffington Post , 
Stoneâ€™s group created an official-looking ID badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake â€œexit polls,â€?efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. Or at least thatâ€™s what the group was planning to do before The Huffington Post asked Stone about it on Tuesday. The controversial Trump ally, long known for his bare-knuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his groupâ€™s websites were there without his knowledge, and assured HuffPost that he would operate within the confines of election law. 
In fact, after HuffPo confronted Stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that Vote Protectors had a â€œbad ideaâ€?and â€œordered them taken down.â€?
Campaign Legal Center deputy director Danielle Lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. 
â€œItâ€™s inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy,â€?she told HuffPo in reference to the videotaping. â€œWhen thatâ€™s being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. Objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it.â€?
Indeed, but thatâ€™s exactly what Donald Trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him. 
As it turns out, heâ€™s right about the election being rigged, only itâ€™s conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of Trump. 
Earlier this week, a Wisconsin city clerk in Green Bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she has merely heard that students lean Democrat. 
â€œI was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,â€?Republican appointed clerk Kris Teske wrote. 
â€œUWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isnâ€™t going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats.â€?
So not only are Trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well. 
And that is likely going to cause a lot of Election Day chaos. Voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what Trumpâ€™s deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it.

Post election, the media and Donald Trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. They are making the claim that Trump wasnâ€™t elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that itâ€™s simply not true. Trump voters are racist and thereâ€™s proof. 
The American National Elections Study (ANES) began the study in January. Initially, they asked â€œHow likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.â€?Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. Itâ€™s VERY unlikely that whites arenâ€™t getting jobs because minorities are, but thatâ€™s not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that itâ€™s â€œextremely likelyâ€?that minorities are taking jobs from white people. Graph courtesy of ANES and Salon . 
Then, they asked the same Trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. Despite the fact that trade was one of Trumpâ€™s signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed. 
Post election, this is what the study found: 
The question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is â€œextremely likelyâ€?that whites canâ€™t find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is â€œnot at allâ€?likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eighty-one percent of white women who think it is â€œextremely likelyâ€?people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who donâ€™t think that. 
More than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are â€œviolent.â€?84 percent think that of Muslims. 
Unfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this: 
Democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As Iâ€™ve shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation. 
Great idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigotsâ€?claims go unchallenged.

Every time Donald Trump suggests the election could be rigged in some way, Democrats and their many media allies scoff and laugh, then accuse Trump of promoting conspiracy theories. 
At the same time, the left is trying to steal the election in broad daylight. 
Bloomberg reports: 
Some Cities Want Their Noncitizen Immigrants to Vote 
â€œLook at illegal immigrants voting all over the country,â€?Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election. Thereâ€™s no evidence to support the Republican nomineeâ€™s claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include noncitizens. 
The latest is San Francisco, where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the cityâ€™s public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. â€œOne out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesnâ€™t have a voice,â€?says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. â€œWeâ€™ve had legal immigrants whoâ€™ve had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.â€?Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the â€œbroken immigration system in this country.â€?
Noncitizen voting isnâ€™t as radical as it might sound. For more than half of U.S. history, from 1776 until the 1920s, noncitizens were widely permitted to participate in elections. â€œWe had 40 states that used to allow it,â€?says Ron Hayduk, an associate professor of political science at San Francisco State University. â€œImmigrants could vote, not just in local elections,â€?he says. â€œThey could even run for officeâ€”and did win office.â€?The hope, Hayduk says, was that immigrants would feel more invested in civic life if they were able to participate in American democracy. 
Do you think Democrats would want non-citizens to vote if they tended to vote Republican? 
Of course not. 
The Democrat party is a criminal enterprise and theyâ€™ll do whatever they have to do to win. shares ",english,2016-10-30T18:07:57.698+02:00,americanlookout.com,US,,WHAT?

President Barack Obama has stood behind Hillary Clinton through every step of the FBI investigation into her use of a private email server as his Secretary of State. He has turned a blind eye to her many crimes and has encouraged investigators to let her off the hook. 
Just when Americans thought he couldnâ€™t get any more corrupt, video footage has surfaced of Obama calling on illegal immigrants to vote today.

NEW YORK â€?Today was not a great day for the Clinton campaign. Recently leaked emails from within the Clinton campaign have reached the ears of some prominent members of the Black Lives Matter community â€?members whom the emails were about. They are particularly upset about a series of emails that seems how to best â€œuseâ€?the victims of gun violence while making sure those victims were black. Understandably, some of the members have taken to speaking out against her campaign now. In a word, theyâ€™re pissed. 
Erica Garner, the daughter of controversial man who died after being put in â€œchokeholdâ€?by a New York officer has been one of the most vocal critics. â€œIâ€™m troubled by the revelation that you and this campaign actually discussed â€˜usingâ€?Eric Garner â€? Why would you want to â€˜useâ€?my dad?â€?she tweeted. 
That was way earlier today. She hasnâ€™t stopped since: â€œIf you vote for her (Clinton) by default you are endorsing her and whatever she does.

Today there are six jurisdictions in Maryland that let noncitizens vote in local elections. Chicago allows them to take part in elected parent advisory councils but not to vote in school board elections. Four towns in Massachusetts have moved to allow noncitizen voting and are awaiting state approval. And in New York City, where noncitizens make up 21 percent of the voting-age population, the city council is drafting legislation that would allow more than 1.3 million legal residents to take part in municipal elections. The city previously allowed noncitizens to vote in school board elections, but that ended when New Yorkâ€™s school boards were dissolved in 2002.

She Canâ€™t Ignore Donald Trumpâ€™s.,"Loading Posted on November 2, 2016 This Professor Devotes Her Life to Countering Dangerous Speech. She Canâ€™t Ignore Donald Trumpâ€™s. Colby Itkowitz, Washington Post, October 24, 2016 
When Susan Benesch began looking at how speech could incite mass violence, her research took her to far-flung places like Kenya and Burma. 
Lately, sheâ€™s been unable to ignore a case study at home in the United States. 
The American University law professor and Harvard University faculty associate has grappled for months with whether Donald Trumpâ€™s rhetoric constitutes dangerous speech as she has come to define it. She has examined election-year speech before, but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great. 
But in the past week, with Trump claiming that the election system and the media are rigged against him, his messages have the type of undertone that increases the risk of violence between groups, she said. 
Benesch, 52, has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech. To rise to that level, at least two of these five indicators must be true: A powerful speaker with a high degree of influence over the audience. The audience has grievances and fears that the speaker can cultivate. A speech act that is clearly understood as a call to violence. A social or historical context that is propitious for violence, for any of a variety of reasons, including long-standing competition between groups for resources, lack of efforts to solve grievances or previous episodes of violence. A means of dissemination that is influential in itself, for example because it is the sole or primary source of news for the relevan t audience. 
â€œTrumpâ€™s speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it,â€?Benesch said in a recent interview. â€œThe meaning is so often ambiguous.â€?
But when Trump said his supporters could use the Second Amendment against Hillary Clinton, â€œit seems to me impossible that people didnâ€™t understand that as a reference to violence,â€?she said. Or when he suggested that Clinton and President Obama were founders of the Islamic State, something he alluded to again at Wednesdayâ€™s final debate, that was a â€œhallmark of dangerous speech to describe an in-group member as the enemy,â€?she said. 
And now, with Trump trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him, heâ€™s definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting. Direct incitement of violence is illegal, but Trump falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience. 
Because of that, itâ€™s still a gray area that surrounds whether Trump does use dangerous speech. 
â€œTrump may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of U.S. democracy,â€?Benesch said. â€œSome of themâ€“those who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messagesâ€“may therefore be more likely to commit violence. However, the United States is not in danger of mass intergroup violence, in my view. It is deeply irresponsible, though, since it can undermine some Americansâ€?belief in our own democratic institutions, which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward.â€?

The Democratic presidential primary was one of unprecedented pandering for the non-white vote. As The Guardian summed up one of the debates: â€œHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders made a conspicuous play for Latino and African American voters.â€?Mrs. Clinton won the â€œconspicuous playâ€?hands down, and with it, the nomination. The failure of Senator Sanders to win the necessary quotient of non-white votes was repeatedly pointed out by the chattering class up until the time he dropped out. 
In February one black commenter pointedly wrote that Sen. Sanders, â€œhas many miles to go to convince black voters that he can fight for our interests.â€?By May, black commenter Steven Thrasher wrote a piece titled, â€?Bernie Sanders isnâ€™t winning minority votes â€?and itâ€™s his own fault .â€?Mr. Thrasher identified Sen. Sandersâ€™s problem as â€œfailing to talk about racism at every turn.â€?
This accusation may seem ludicrous, since Sen. Sanders surrendered his stage to Black Lives Matter activists several times. But in comparison to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Thrasher was right about Sen. Sanders. No mainstream candidate in the history of the United States has more thoroughly debased himself in the quest for the black vote than Mrs. Clinton. Since this helped her win the Democratic nomination, she has continued the strategy. In the few days remaining before November 8th, letâ€™s take a look at Hillary Clintonâ€™s most ethnomasochistic moments. 
1) In January of 2016, Mrs. Clinton was at something called the Iowa Brown and Black Forum (with none other than Jorge Ramos ), where she was asked â€œCan you tell us what the term â€˜white privilegeâ€?means to you? And can you give me an example from your life or career when you think you have benefitted from it?â€?This is how she began her answer: 
Where do I start? I think it is hard when you are swimming in the ocean to know exactly what is happening around you so much as it is when youâ€™re standing on the shore perhaps watching . . . . I was born white, middle-class, in the middle of America. . . . 
2) Early in the Democratic nomination, Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign released a memo aimed at stifling the rising momentum of Bernie Sanders: 
[W]hereas the electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire are largely rural/suburban and predominantly white, the March [primary] states better reflect the true diversity of the Democratic Party and the nation . . . . It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among African American and Hispanic voters. We believe thatâ€™s how it should be. emphasis added 
3) Shortly before the South Carolina primary, at Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, Mrs. Clinton explained how to break down barriers for African Americans: 
Ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of usâ€”especially those of us who havenâ€™t experienced it ourselves. White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day. 
We need to recognize our privilege and practice humility, rather than assume that our experiences are everyoneâ€™s experiences. All of us need to bring our skills to bearâ€”and especially young people coming up today, who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems. 
4) In April of 2016, while on a back radio show, Mrs. Clinton was asked what she always carries in her bag. She immediately answered, â€œhot sauce.â€?When one of the black hosts noted that she would be accused of pandering to black people for giving that answer, she asked hopeully, â€œIs it working?â€?
5) Just a few weeks after a Black Lives Matter supporter murdered five police officers , the Democratic National Convention that convened to nominate Mrs. Clinton passed a resolution, no doubt with her approval, supporting Black Lives Matter : 
[T]he DNC joins with Americans across the country in affirming â€˜Black lives matterâ€?and the â€˜say her nameâ€?efforts to make visible the pain of our fellow and sister Americans as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed African American men, women and children. 
White politicians have tried to win elections through public displays of ethnomasochism for decades, but this election has set a new low. And if Mrs. Clinton loses, her pandering could live on in another form. As the Black Lives Matter activist Tef Poe explained , if Mr. Trump wins, â€œyoung niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go . . . ainâ€™t no more rules. Weâ€™ve been too nice as is.â€?,english,2016-11-07T17:45:01.884+02:00,amren.com,US,94243,How Hillary Courts the Black Vote,0,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Resolution L.41 (pdf) was accepted by a vote of 123-38, with 16 member nations abstaining. The vote was held during a meeting of the First Committee of the UN General Assembly, which deals with disarmament and international security matters.
â€œFor seven decades, the UN has warned of the dangers of nuclear weapons, and people globally have campaigned for their abolition. Today the majority of states finally resolved to outlaw these weapons,â€?said Beatrice Fihn, executive director of International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear weapons (ICAN).
Setsuko Thurlow , a survivor of the Hiroshima and leading proponent of a ban, also celebrated Thursdayâ€™s vote.
â€œThis is a truly historic moment for the entire world,â€?Thurlow said. â€œFor those of us who survived the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it is a very joyous occasion. We have been waiting so long for this day to come.â€?As expected, nuclear powers including the United States, France, Canada, Israel, Russia, and the United Kingdom, as well as several of their European allies, were among the nations who voted against the ban.

For the first time ever, the US has abstained from the UN vote denouncing the ongoing US embargo of Cuba. The resolution passed through the general assembly 191-0, with the US and Israel the only ones abstaining. 
The UN has been voting overwhelmingly against the embargo for decades, but it is only in the past year that President Obama has started to criticize the embargo himself, and has sought to ease a lot of the long-standing restrictions on the island nation. 
The matter is hugely politically contentious within the US, however, with many in the Republican Congress condemning the White House for easing the restrictions, and the Congressional leadership so far preventing any more easing of the restrictions on commerce. 
The UN resolution itself is non-binding, and the real significance is not that it passed, but rather that the US abstained, which while reflecting the administrationâ€™s position is unusual, as it criticizes the US Congress internationally.

In early October, the Colombian people voted NO to peace. 
Or to be exact, 50.2 percent of 37 percent of the eligible population voted no. In the referendum held on October 2, the majority of voters decided to scuttle the agreement between the government and FARC rebels, which had been reached after four years of peace talks dedicated to ending 52 years of bloodshed. 
The vote came just days after the celebratory signing of the agreement, which was lauded in the international community for achieving a bridge between historic enemies and dealing broadly with the root causes of the conflict. The rest of the world was stunned. 
Most pundits have begun the post-mortem analysis of the referendum by saying something like â€œColombians did not vote against peace.â€?They go on to discuss other factors, including peopleâ€™s ignorance of the accords, or their mistaken belief that after four years it could simply be renegotiated. 
But the fact of the matter is that the NO voters voted clearly and unambiguously to continue the war. The words on the ballot read: â€œDo you accept the final agreement to terminate the conflict and build a stable and lasting peace?â€?Itâ€™s almost inconceivable that any population would vote no on this proposition, but they did. 
So why did they? 
Although even former president Alvaro Uribe, the nationâ€™s leading warmonger, now makes the politically correct statement that the ultimate goal is peace, the macho sentiments of total domination and punishment (of one side), along with a strong dose of Cold War hysteria (yes, in the 21 st century) won the day. 
The NO promoters knew what they were doing. They were not promoting an alternative peace. As a 32-year old NO voter quoted in the New York Times put it, â€œIf â€˜noâ€?wins, we wonâ€™t have peace, but at least we wonâ€™t give the country away to the guerrillas.â€?
His statement reflects the patriarchal logic that has started and perpetuated wars since time immemorial â€?the only good enemy is a dead enemy, and if I donâ€™t win, nobody wins. 
At least some NO voters and many of the leaders are betting on continuing war until they gain by force their entire military and political agenda â€?a prospect that, given the warâ€™s longevity to date could easily be another half century. Or never. 
The Perks of Permanent War 
For many NO promoters, including Uribe himself, â€œneverâ€?could be the best-case scenario. Basking in the limelight of a political career rebuilt on the ruins of one the most complex and progressive peace agreements in history, Uribe released proposals for revamping the peace agreement designed to throw a monkey wrench into any process to salvage peace in Colombia. 
Analysts quoted on CNNâ€™s Spanish channel observed that Uribeâ€™s wish list is aimed at â€œtorpedoing the peace accords.â€?Thatâ€™s correct: No one expects the FARC to accept Uribeâ€™s terms, which include banning the group from politics, sentencing members to 5-8 year prison terms for crimes including drug trafficking, pardoning Colombiaâ€™s security forces for their own serious crimes, and eliminating the meticulously negotiated Tribunal for Transitional Justice. 
Huge sectors of the population reject Uribeâ€™s terms as well, since his proposals would also wipe out the parts of the peace accord that regulate the return of stolen lands to peasant and indigenous communities and seriously hamper, if not strike altogether, plans for reparations to victims. They also could rollback meticulously negotiated gains in gender justice and LGBT rights. 
To pretend that everyone wants peace and the only issue is how to get it is to ignore the fact that the war benefits many powerful interests. Those interests will fight to keep fighting. 
On the political front, war assures military control over a population and justifies authoritarianism and repression through fear. In general, the most militarized parts of the country are areas where peasants, Afro-Colombians, and indigenous peoples are defending their lands and resources from the incursions of transnational corporations and mega development projects. Fear and murder are powerful repressive tools. 
War is also a huge business. Thanks to U.S. Plan Colombia and policies that fanned the conflict, Colombia became the third largest recipient of US aid in the world during the war, behind only Israel and Egypt. Colombiaâ€™s budget for security forces skyrocketed ; between 2001 and 2005, it grew more than 30 percent, and by 2006 it was double its 1990 levels â€?some $4.48 billion for military and police. 
US Interests 
The US military-industrial complex also has a vested interest in continuing the war. The conflict justified Plan Colombia, the $10 billion dollar counterinsurgency and counternarcotics plan that allowed the Pentagon to establish a military presence in Colombia, both physically and by proxy. With the pretext of Colombiaâ€™s internal conflict, the US government built up a platform not only for control in Colombia, but also for regional strike capacity, as leaked in the proposed agreement to establish seven US military bases. 
Plan Colombia and its later incarnations kept US contracts for weapons, espionage, intelligence equipment, and military and police training flowing to the most powerful lobbying industries in the nation. Billions of dollars have been poured into Plan Colombia and national security investments that ended up in the pockets of political elites and US defense companies. In the budgets for fiscal years 2010-2017, the United States allocated over $2 billion in military and police aid â€?most of that during the peace talks. 
In the process, Colombia was converted into a testing ground for the latest in counterinsurgency and unconventional warfare techniques and equipment from the United States. The blood spilled on its soil feeds the global war machine, to such an extent that Colombia has been groomed as an exporter of counterinsurgency and â€œsecurityâ€?training, despite its reputation as a gross violator of human rights and the disastrous humanitarian impact of its prolonged war. Colombian forces now work throughout the region to promote the same counternarcotics-counterinsurgency model that left more than 5 million people displaced and untold thousands of innocent peasants executed by security forces. 
So very powerful interests saw the peace agreement as a threat. In addition to Uribe followers who viewed it as soft on the FARC, the war economy of the nation and its ally, the United States, was at stake. 
In this context, the US government reacted tepidly when peace was voted down. Bernard Aronson, the special envoy to the peace talks, expressed no regret in a press interview after the vote, stating, â€œWe believe Colombians want peace, but clearly they are divided about terms of settlement.â€?The State Department limited its statement to support for Colombian democracy and further dialogue. After four years of ostensibly supporting the peace talks, neither mentioned the vote as a setback. 
An analysis published by the US Army War College, although it is not an official document, openly expresses relief at the continuation of indefinite war in Colombia. Through a mixture of hawkish arguments and lies , the analysis recognizes that the country now enters into a â€œperiod of uncertainty,â€?but notes that this â€œpresents a strategic situation less grave and more manageable, than had the accords been approved.â€?
It goes on to predict that the FARC will likely break the ceasefire, despite the groupâ€™s explicit and public commitment to respect it even in the absence of the guarantees provided in the peace agreement. This position â€?coming from sources close to the US military, which has in many senses called the shots in Colombiaâ€™s war since Plan Colombia began in 2000 â€?indicates that there is a dangerous possibility of a provocation to further undermine the peace process that has now been thrown into crisis by the NO vote. 
The writers also advise President Juan Santos, who staked his political capital on supporting the deal, to retract his commitment to the ceasefire following the vote. They note that Santos promised to â€œnot authorize military operations in the areas where FARC units are located in order to avoid an incident which breaks the fragile truce. Yet not doing so will allow FARC dissidents to operate with almost complete impunity in these areas. Indeed, within the new background of uncertainty, such impunity will increase incentives for FARC units to continue illicit activity, such as drug trafficking, since doing so will pose relatively low risks.â€?
War Engenders More War, Not Peace 
Before the NO vote, the US press hailed Plan Colombia for making peace possible. President Obama, in his self-congratulatory last speech to the UN, proclaimed that we â€œhelped Colombia end Latin Americaâ€™s longest war.â€?The logic of this bizarre argument went that were it not for the military debilitation of the guerrillas thanks to the U.S.-Colombian military alliance, the FARC could never have been brought to the negotiating table. 
The NO vote is the classic example of the fallacy of that logic. The war fomented by Plan Colombia built up a mentality that made peace an unacceptable solution for many. It revealed the fundamental clash of perspectives between diplomacy and annihilation. 
The lesson couldnâ€™t be clearer: War is a terrible preparation for peace. Peace depends on much more than a favorable correlation of forces. Peace, at its core, is a rejection of force as the way to confront differences, and a search for nonviolent solutions to conflict and conflict prevention. 
With US military theorists openly calling for reopening hostilities, it is a dangerous myth to assume that at this juncture everyone wants peace and the only open question is how to do it. Plan Colombia, the U.S.-sponsored war on drugs, and Uribeâ€™s â€œDemocratic Securityâ€?policy all posit continued militarization. Those who promote peace and reconciliation in the country must deal with that mentality head on. To second-guess or justify NO voters with â€œthey-know-not-what-they-doâ€?arguments reflects the kind of complacency and misreading of the public that created this dangerous debacle in the first place. 
There is no doubt that a massive campaign of misinformation and scaremongering played a role. Voters were bombarded with alarmist messages that spun out wild scenarios, from a legislative takeover by the former FARC to a â€œChavez-Castro style dictatorship.â€?CNNâ€™s footage of the NO celebration showed the crowd chanting â€œThe NO won, now we wonâ€™t have a Cuban dictatorship.â€?It didnâ€™t seem to matter that there was no logical relationship between voting for the peace agreement and the nation becoming a dictatorship. 
For followers of Uribe, who led the massive campaign against the negotiations and the acceptance of the agreement, the vote was ideological and personal. It represented the right against the left, and Uribe against Santos. For many people stuck in bitter partisan politics, to vote for peace was to vote in favor of the latter. 
It is also likely that many people did not have a clear understanding of the accords or their implications, which is a failing of the negotiators and SI (yes) promoters that left a fatal opening for NO propaganda. Some voters also apparently believed that four years of arduous negotiations with the technical support of scores of international experts and mediators could simply be reopened and â€œfixedâ€?to their liking, though Santos made it clear there was â€œno Plan B.â€?Some NO voters quoted in the press even expressed dismay that they had won, believing they were merely casting a protest vote. 
Despite these factors, the NO vote reveals a major obstacle: Society has been trained over years of conflict â€?one of the longest-running internal conflicts in the world â€?to acquiesce to war as the only response, to dehumanize the enemy and overlook the obvious fact that it takes two sides to sustain hostilities. Itâ€™s created a society that believes the only solution is to drive the enemy into the ground â€?even when they are men and women from oneâ€™s own country and their grievances reflect serious social problems. 
This is the patriarchal mentality that the war industry thrives on. Plan Colombia has fomented this mentality since it began. It conflated a war on drugs with a counterinsurgency war to justify foreign intervention and broaden the war. The US government knew that military funding was going directly to paramilitary groups. A 2010 empirical study demonstrated a measurable relationship between increases in US security funding and paramilitary homicides. War propaganda presented the FARC as the sole culprit, when terrible atrocities were being committed on both sides. 
With the exceptions of Arauca and Norte de Santander, the departments on Colombiaâ€™s borders that have suffered most in the war voted to end it. They know what itâ€™s like to feel their houses shaken by bombs, to risk life and limb walking through minefields, to lose their loved ones in crossfire. They know that to stop the violence in their day-to-day lives is far more important than the political games of how punishment and power are dished out. 
War as a policy is almost always favored by those farthest from the battlefields. 
The Road to Peace 
Understanding the very real and perilous obstacles is not the same as being pessimistic or defeatist at this point in the Colombian peace process â€?itâ€™s a process, after all. Itâ€™s important not to minimize the enormity of this setback â€?President Santosâ€?Nobel Peace Prize may be deserved, but itâ€™s a sorry consolation prize for having gotten so close only to be slapped down. But itâ€™s also important to acknowledge that there is still room to move forward. 
The peace accords opened up a dialogue and allowed the nation to envision peace. Grassroots organizations are mobilizing in defense of this vision and the possibility of a new reality. 
This is the hope on the horizon. Since the NO vote, thousands have marched to support the peace process in Bogota, and also in Cali and cities across the country. The marches have awakened and united groups of indigenous peoples, Afro-Colombians, victims, students, human rights defenders, peasants, women, and the LGBT community in defense of peace. 
The international community should openly and actively support the call for a broad grassroots dialogue for peace. It must continue to be firm and vigilant, because there will be a serious attempt to force a return to the model of military annihilation of the left-wing guerrillas while leaving right-wing paramilitaries and other militarist structures intact. 
International organizations committed millions of dollars to support peace implementation, and it must be clear that those funds will only be released when the process is back on track. Part of creating adequate conditions is to deny any new funding to militarism â€?including the war on drugs, which acts as a thinly veiled excuse for militarization. 
The NO vote unexpectedly flipped the political situation back in favor of the right-wing hawks. This uprising could not only flip it back in favor of peace, but also create a social movement capable of going beyond the accords in terms of establishing social justice and human rights and addressing the enormous backlog of demands from below.

US intelligence officials have reportedly warned law enforcement around the country of the potential for multiple al-Qaeda terrorist attacks on Monday, aimed to coincide with the day before the US election. The reports were described as â€?possibly legitimate and concerning. â€?
Details are still scant, but the intelligence has singled out New York, Virginia, and Texas as the mostly likely targets. Even then, they offered no details on potential locations, saying al-Qaeda and its affiliates are eager to regain their relevance. 
A NYPD spokesman briefed on the matter said that the threats â€?lack specificity ,â€?however local police around the country were said to have been warned that polling places are considered â€œattractive targetsâ€?for both organized and homegrown terror attacks. 
Of course, saying that any upcoming event is a potential â€œattractive targetâ€?is not unusual these days, and hardly a significant holiday goes by in the US where warnings and briefings about potential attacks are not heavily publicized. 
The Monday warning offers some unusual details, however, as generally one would think the day of the election itself would be the target, when more people are queuing up for the vote. An attack the day before the election would, however, cast a rather dramatic pall over the entire matter.

A Saudi prince has urged Americans not to vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming general election. He practically beggs the people to give their votes for Hillary Clinton. For us, this is a HUGE reason NOT TO VOTE FOR HILLARY! She got $50 million from this man. I guess you know what am I talking about. Do not let their cooperation continue, because it is going to end up bad for America. Lets choose a true patriot and see where would our country go! I am sure it is going to be much better than crooked Hillaryâ€™s road. 
Turki al-Faisal, who served as Saudia Arabiaâ€™s ambassador to the US from 2005 to 2007, spoke against the presumptive Republican nominee during a foreign policy dinner in Washington, DC on Thursday. 
He blasted Trumpâ€™s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, which the billionaire first formulated in December last year before renewing his vow on Wednesday. 
â€˜For the life of me, I cannot believe that a country like the United States can afford to have someone as president who simply says, â€œThese people are not going to be allowed to come to the United States,â€â€?Turki said according to the Huffington Post. 
â€˜Itâ€™s up to you, itâ€™s not up to me,â€?Turki added. â€˜I just hope you, as American citizens, will make the right choice in November.â€?
The gulf nations represent three of the largest donors to the foundation, but that is hardly the extent of their ties to the Clintons. Qatari, UAE, and Saudi firms paid Bill Clinton millions of dollars for speeches during the time Hillary served as secretary of state, when she also approved weapons deals with all three countries worth billions of dollars to U.S. defense firms, many of which are also Clinton Foundation donors. 
Bill Clinton has praised the Qataris as â€œintelligent, forward lookingâ€?investment partners for their collaboration on Clinton Foundation projects. One of Hillaryâ€™s top advisers, Cheryl Mills, served on the board of the New York 
University campus in Abu Dhabi. Bill Clinton is the friend and former classmate of Saudi Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, who recently attended a lavish Clinton Foundation conference in Marrakech, hosted by the King of Morocco. The Bill Clinton presidential library in Little Rock was funded in part by a $10 million from the Saudi Royal family. 
Turk, who went to Georgetown University in Washington, DC, isnâ€™t currently part of Saudia Arabiaâ€™s government but serves as the chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, a cultural organization that conducts research in politics, sociology and heritage.",english,2016-10-27T00:19:59.268+03:00,awdnews.com,DE,,Arab Prince Who Gave Hillary $50 Million Begs Americans Not to Vote for Trump,0,http://awdnews.com/images/14774946001.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,conspiracy,Negative
