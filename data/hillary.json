    "text": "Red State : \nFox News Sunday reported this morning that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI, which has re-opened (yes, lefties: ※re-opened§) the investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s classified emails. Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show: \nAnd the news is breaking while we＊re on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn＊t need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. \nTargets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiner＊s well-known penchant for lying, it＊s hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms 〞 and, as Wallace indicated on this morning＊s show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. We＊ll see if Weiner＊s cooperation extends beyond that. More Related",

    "text": "BREAKING! NYPD Ready To Make Arrests In Weiner Case＃Hillary Visited Pedophile Island At Least 6 Times＃Money Laundering, Underage Sex, Pay-for-Play,Proof of Inappropriate Handling Classified Information Blackwater USA Founder, Retired Navy Seal Erik Prince \nPrince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clinton＊s email server last week. \n※Because of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,§ Prince claimed. \n※They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,§ he said. \n※The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, ＆We＊re going to go public with this if you don＊t reopen the investigation and you don＊t do the right thing with timely indictments,＊§ Prince explained. \n※I believe 每 I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York 每 the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they＊ve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. That＊s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,§ Prince said. \n※There＊s five different parts of the FBI conducting investigations into these things, with constant downdrafts from the Obama Justice Department. So in the, I hope, unlikely and very unfortunate event that Hillary Clinton is elected president, we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since, I believe, 1860,§ Prince declared. \nMarlow asked Prince to clarify these revelations. \n※NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,§ Prince elaborated. ※Weiner and Huma Abedin, his wife 每 the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years 每 have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have 每 they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton＊s own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.§ \n※So NYPD first gets that computer. They see how disgusting it is. They keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the FBI, which finally pushes the FBI off their chairs, making Comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. The point being, NYPD has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the FBI doesn＊t,§ Prince contended. \n※There is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails they＊ve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to SAP level Special Access Programs,§ he stated. \n※So the plot thickens. NYPD was pushing because, as an article quoted one of the chiefs 每 that＊s the level just below commissioner 每 he said as a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue,§ Prince said. \nHe noted that the FBI can investigate these matters, ※but they can＊t convene a grand jury. They can＊t file charges.§ \n※The prosecutors, the Justice Department has to do that,§ he explained. ※Now, as I understand it, Preet Bharara, the Manhattan prosecutor, has gotten ahold of some of this. From what I hear, he＊s a stand-up guy, and hopefully he does the right thing.§ \nMarlow agreed that Bharara＊s ※sterling reputation§ as a determined prosecutor was ※bad news for the Clintons.§ \nPrince agreed, but said, ※If people are willing to bend or break the law and don＊t really care about the Constitution or due process 每 if you＊re willing to use Stalinist tactics against someone 每 who knows what level of pressure§ could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials? \nListen to interview here: \n※The point being, fortunately, it＊s not just the FBI; [there are] five different offices that are in the hunt for justice, but the NYPD has it as well,§ Prince said, citing the Wall Street Journal reporting that has ※exposed downdraft, back pressure from the Justice Department§ against both the FBI and NYPD, in an effort to ※keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on, and is slowly being exposed.§ \n※The Justice Department is trying to run out the clock, to elect Hillary Clinton, to prevent any real justice from being done,§ he warned. \nAs for the mayor of New York City, Prince said he has heard that ※de Blasio wants to stay away from this.§ \n※The evidence is so bad, the email content is so bad, that I think even he wants to stay away from it, which is really telling,§ he said. \nFor entire story: Breitbart News 14.7K shares",

    "text": "Go to Article Dear Abby, I supported a woman I knew had a history of criminal activity, who is married to a rapist and who left 4 men to die in Benghazi. She put our national security at grave risk by leaving top classified emails on her private server, and she took money from nations who throw gays off rooftops and treat women worse than cockroaches. She is likely very sick and would be unlikely to serve out her first term without someone there to prop her up, but nevertheless, I supported her anyhow, because she＊s a Democrat and has a vagina. Someone told me she still has a chance of winning the presidency if I just signed a petition. They said that Trump really didn＊t win, because Hillary won the popular vote. Is that true? \nOkay, let＊s address this ※Hillary might win the popular vote, isn＊t that Electoral College situation just awful§ thing head on. \nNo, it＊s not awful. It＊s great, and it protects the importance of your vote. It＊s also uniquely American and demonstrates yet again the once-in-creation brilliance of the Founding Fathers. \nFirst of all, she＊s probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. \nStates don＊t count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldn＊t influence the election results, then the absentee ballots aren＊t counted. \nWho votes by absentee ballot? Students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. The historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 67-33% Republican. In 2000, when Al Gore ※won§ the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone. A 67-33 breakout of those yields a 1.33- to 0.667-million Republican vote advantage, so Bush would have gotten a 667,000-vote margin from California＊s uncounted absentee ballots alone! So much for Gore＊s 500,000 popular vote ※victory.§ (That was the headline on the N.Y. Times, and it was the lead story on NBC Nightly News, right? No? You＊re kidding.) \nGetting back to the ※win the popular vote/lose the Electoral College§ scenario: Thank G-d we have that, or else California and N.Y. would determine every election. Every time. \nBut the Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. Farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. \nShortcomings? Sure. The E.C. can make an R vote meaningless in a very few heavily D states or vice versa. But without the Electoral College, the country＊s entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states. 每 American Thinker Comment on this Article Via Your Facebook Account Comment on this Article Via Your Disqus Account Follow Us on Facebook!",

    "title": "FBI REDUX: What＊s Behind New Probe into Hillary Clinton Emails?",
    "text": "In a stunning turn of events 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, the FBI announced it is reopenning its investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s email server case, by probing newly emerging emails linked to Hillary Clinton. \n＆NEW PROBE＊每 The FBI gives Hillary Clinton a second look. (Photo illustraion 21WIRE) \nFBI October Surprise? \nAccording to reports , in a letter written today, FBI Director James Comey , stated that the FBI has begun a new probe into Hillary Clinton related emails once again. Comey offered scant details about the new probe, but due to an unrelated case, additional classified material may have been mishandled on Clinton＊s personal email server. \nCNBC reported the latest FBI developments, including a passage from Comey＊s letter discussing the new investigation: \n※In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton＊s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,§ Comey wrote. \nIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,§ he added. \nAlthough the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony,§ Comey concluded.§ \nHuma＊s Estranged ＆Sexting＊ Husband \nAccording to a new report released via The New York Times : \n※The presidential campaign was rocked on Friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton ＊s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide.§ ※ In a letter to Congress , the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, which law enforcement officials said was an F.B.I. investigation into illicit text messages from Mr. Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, is married to Huma Abedin, the top aide.§ Comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting Clinton off the hook for mishandling, and lying to Congress, about classified emails coming through her ＆home brew＊ email server while she was Secretary of State. After previously closing the case, Comey has done a U-turn and is now saying the FBI will review the new emails to for classified information, and see whether it was mishandled. \nThis unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a Wikileaks docu-dump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between Clinton Foundation donors and former president Bill Clinton ＆s private financial activities. Among those included in the memo, was a $30 million dollar business arrangement under ※Bill Clinton, Inc.,§ with another $66 million dollar deal scheduled over nine years. \nThe following is a tweet from Brad Jaffy of NBC Nightly News containing the new FBI recommendation＃ \nThe new investigation into the Clinton camp will most certainly spark new ＆Pay-to-Play＊ allegations , as the new FBI revelations also comes days after a Project Veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, discussed ways to commit ＆large-scale＊ voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at Donald Trump rallies. Out of Creamer＊s 342 visits to the White House, also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman, Jan Schakowsky some 47 times. White House visitor records show that Schakowsky took 47 ※private meetings with Obama or his senior staff,§ also over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics 每 thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability. ＆CAUGHT ON FILM＊ 每 Robert Creamer resigns over a massive Democratic Party controversy. (Image Source: CNN ) Creamer, a convicted felon , (in 2005, Creamer plead guilty $2.3 million in bank fraud and tax violations) was promptly ※shoved out of the Hillary Clinton campaign＊s inner circle,§ following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at Trump rallies. ＆PAY TO PLAY?＊每 Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe closely allied with the Clinton＊s negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the FBI. (Image Source new republic ) It remains unclear what exactly reopened the new Clinton probe, but perhaps the FBI had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime Clinton associate , Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe , ※helped steer $675,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an FBI official who went on to lead the probe into Hillary Clinton＊s use of a private email system, according to a report.§ The NY Post also reported on the matter this past week: \n※The political action committee of McAuliffe, the Clinton loyalist, gave $467,500 to the state Senate campaign of the wife of Andrew McCabe, who is now deputy director of the FBI, according to the Wall Street Journal . \nThe report states Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe. \nThe money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate＊s husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the bureau.§ \nIn a CNN report from October 18th, a week before the McAuliffe revelations, ※＃According to notes from interviews conducted during an FBI investigation into Clinton＊s email practices, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy personally tried to convince FBI officials that the email should be declassified. One interviewee described feeling ※pressured§ by another FBI official at Kennedy＊s request.§ \nThe newly reopened FBI investigation into Clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above, but there＊s no doubt that due to public backlash the FBI received following the first Clinton investigation, in addition to concerns over dealings between the FBI and Clinton associates 每 the agency needed to save face. \nIt remains to be seen how new case will impact the US Presidential election. \nMore from RT below＃",

    "title": "Hillary＊s ＆Russian Hack＊ Hoax: The Biggest Lie of This Election Season",
    "text": "November 1, 2016 By 21wire 4 Comments \nPatrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire \nThe longer this soap opera drags on, it＊s becoming more and more evident that the Russian government did not ＆hack＊ into the DNC, and Moscow is not feeding John Podesta＊s emails to Wikileaks. For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, this might be a hard pill to swallow. \nThe White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that ＆Putin is hacking the US elections.＊ In response, the President is weighing his options 每 tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed ＆malicious cyber-activity＊ tools. \nEven VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying,§We＊re sending a message. We have the capacity to do it.§ \nIt seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US? \nWhat was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected America＊s left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton＊s constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washington＊s new anti-Russia movement. \nOn July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote, ※The Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton＊s private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans.§ \nAnyone who was paying attention back then knew this ＆Russian hack＊ talking point was purely political, but then again, who＊s really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media. \nYou can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party＊s hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trump＊s GOP primary success. From that point on, Trump＊s political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words, ＆comparing one dictator to another.＊ \nNever one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance . ※If you＊ve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own party＊s nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin?§ said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami. \nBacked by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia 每 not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona 每 a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The media＊s coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled, ※ Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system ,§ we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: \n※Hackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state.§ \nBut then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: \n※The bureau described the threat as ※credible§ and significant, ※an eight on a scale of one to 10,§ Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the state＊s voter registration system for nearly a week.§ \nAnd then, down to almost nothing＃ \n※It turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County.§ \nAt no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like, ※Cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack.§ \nAre American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French: ＆bottom of the bag＊) where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories 每 in the middle a national election cycle? It＊s a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election. \nBehind Clinton＊s wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House＃ \nOn October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clinton＊s campaign manager John Podesta 每 giving them to Wikileaks. \nSoon, there was a queue of ＆national security＊ politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out, ※Russia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putin＊s calculus with a strong diplomatic, political, -cyber and economic response.§ \nAccording to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima , the only ＆evidence＊ that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged ＆Russian government hacks＊每 provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike . No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrike＊s word for it. \nIMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security. \nThe Post＊s Nakashima then added: \n※The administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers.§ \nAn online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are ※consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,§ the joint statement said. ※＃ We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia＊s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.§ \nMoscow＊s press secretary＊s reply: ※This is some sort of nonsense,§ said Dmitry Peskov. \nDespite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNN＊s Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really ※confirmed§ that Russia was behind the email hacks 每 and still no evidence , other than speculative guesswork, has been presented. \nLikewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that ※Russia did it,§ thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesn＊t seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona 每 are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a ＆ parallel universe .＊ \nStill, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how ※ 17 US intelligence agencies § aka the ※Intelligence Community§每 all agreed that Russia did it. \nThe announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \n※We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,§ said Clinton. ※I find that deeply disturbing.§ \nWhat＊s even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clinton＊s ＊17 agencies＊: \nAir Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \nWhat does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podesta＊s emails? Answer: nothing. \nThe exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016 . The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda. \nIn both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washington＊s flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and ※journalists§ working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN 每 none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Party＊s decree that ※Russian is hacking the US election process.§ If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement: ※＃ [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow 〞 the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia＊s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.§ According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney , when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are ＆hacking＊ US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a ※ disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker. § \nUnder partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid , the FBI also initiated another investigation into ※people linked to the Trump team with Russia.§ Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI haven＊t come up with anything. \nTo be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack 每 because her staff read it to her from the campaign＊s daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US government＊s much vaunted Intelligence Community . Of course, that＊s the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddam＊s nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraq＊s imaginary ※Winnebagos of Death§ aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks. \nFor those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as ＆Washington Intelligence,＊ I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now, ※No, that was Iraq, that was Bush. We＊re not like that. No, this time it＊s different. This time we are sure the Russians did it!§ \nIn 2014, Obama claimed that Kim＊s notorious ※Bureau 121§ hacked into Sony Pictures. \nThis isn＊t the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign ＆hack＊ and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washington＊s conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called ＆ Bureau 121 .＊ Just like with today＊s ※Russian Hack§ theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White House＊s ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the ＆Russian Hack＊ claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike . \nJumping the Shark \nAfter their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative. \nSoon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to ※destabilize and dominate the West.§ Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of ＆interfering＊ with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back. The biggest impact of @wikileaks ? Shining a spotlight on Russia＊s attempt to undermine American democracy and Trump＊s refusal to condemn it https://t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5 \n〞 Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016 \nClinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only ＆evidence＊ seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as ＆proof＊ that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaign＊s desperate claims. It was embarrassing. \nThey could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead. \nEither way, the political strategy here is clear 每 to shoot the messenger . The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video 每 their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization. \nTheir other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz . They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened. \nTo prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. ※For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful,§ said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race. ※I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year＊s historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week＊s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,§ said Clinton. \nThe party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it. \nParty Meltdown \nWasserman Schultz＊s replacement didn＊t fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches 每 showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives 每 straight to Hillary Clinton. \n※ A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN＊s Jake Tapper.§ \n※ A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich.§ (Source: Daily Caller ) \nBrazile＊s audacious fraud also helped contribute to her party＊s planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: \n. Completely corrupt and still, Brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on FOX News last week. Brazile＊s reputation is so bad now that even CNN has severed ties with her 每 and that＊s saying a lot. \nIn addition, it was also revealed how CNN＊s head political commentator, Gloria Borger , was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of ＆journalists＊ the Clinton campaign would ※work with§ to gain favorable coverage. You＊d think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNN＊s election coverage. \nClearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Ever-unbiased CNN's Gloria Borger refers to being in \"GOP hell\" and says she'll \"reach out soon\" to Podesta. Heart-warming #PodestaEmails13 pic.twitter.com/CQFdcJ12Q5 \n〞 400-lb Hacker Owens (@NubianAwakening) October 21, 2016 \nWorse Than Watergate \nPerhaps a bigger scandal which the Obama White House and Clinton campaign operatives would like to bury 每 is the FBI＊s investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue: \n※Some investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isn＊t unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president.§ \nThere＊s more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe , received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe 每 a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times . \nSo why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia , and cover-up the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps? One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top 每 to the President himself. \nWhat 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillary＊s unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clinton＊s server ※the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.§ The President＊s lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that: \n※Obama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clinton＊s private email server.§ \nSo, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails ※off grid§ with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server 每 maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it. \nSure, he＊s not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club 每 caught out lying to the American people. \nOn top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as ※ born classified .§ The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. \nCOVER-UP: John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet (Image: ABC News ) \nIt should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action 每 that the Obama Justice Department (DOJ) is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case. \nOn Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case 每 currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin) who was snared in a ＆sexting＊ scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation? None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik . Who is Kadzik? Zero Hedge reports: \n※Oh yes. Recall our post from last week, ※ Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary＊s Benghazi Hearing § in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton＊s Benghazi testimony? It was Peter Kadzik.§ \nOh, and if that wasn＊t good enough, Kadzik was also Podesta＊s lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as ＆best friends.＊ FOX News confirms: \n※Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,§ Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta＊s Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. \nTo call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it. \nRussia 每 The Party Scapegoat \nFormer Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting: ※Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.§ Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. \n〞 Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) October 29, 2016 \nAnother veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville , was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused ※the KGB§ working with Republicans to ※hijack the election§ during his wild rant on MSNBC . \n※I think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. That＊s what I think,§ said Carville. \nMaybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB , and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991. \nThese are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many expos谷s revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence 每 unlike the ＆Russians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks.＊ \nSuffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that ＆Putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US.＊ They＊ve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-Russian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep 每 a perfect double entendre . \nThe geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washington＊s State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry , Samantha Power , and John Kirby , already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown 每 that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of US-backed ＆rebels＊ Al Nusra Front, or Nour al-Din al-Zenki. \nWith so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about? \nThe demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup d＊etat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that it＊s been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks 每 and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing America＊s own state-run media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said , ※We are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram,§ He was forced to resign shortly after that. \nWhat＊s clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although ＆ Russian-backed Rebles Shootting Down MH17 ,＊ and ＆ Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013 ＆ certainly comes to mind. \nThat said, it＊s hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of ＆Hacking Into the US Electoral Process.＊ When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders . Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washington＊s claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 Election \nOn Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table: \n※We have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. It＊s not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security.§ \nSelf-serving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the Obama-Clinton era. \nKnowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere 每 if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry. \nStill, we＊re waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington 每 before it＊s too late. \nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \nSUPPORT 21WIRE 每 SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV \nFiled Under: Featured , Patrick Henningsen , Shout , US News Tagged With: CNN , Debbie Wasserman Schultz , Donna Brazile , Gloria Borger , Hillary Clinton , Media Cog , Russia , wikileaks WillDippel \nHere is an article that looks at the real story behind one of the more interesting conspiracy theories about the 2016 election: \nSometimes the real story is even more fascinating than any conspiracy theory.

    "title": "WikiLeaks: Hillary Clinton knew Saudi, Qatar were funding ISIS 每 but still took their money for Foundation",
    "text": "21st Century Wire says＃ \nThis should be the biggest revelation yet from WikiLeaks already epic email trove. Will the US media cover this story? \nLast night, in an RT Exclusive interview conducted by award-winning filmmaker John Pilger, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange described what he believes is ※the most significant email in the whole collection.§ \nWikiLeaks reveals an early 2014 email where the outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was urging John Podesta , then advisor to President Barack Obama, to ※bring pressure§ on Gulf states Saudi Arabia and Qatar, ※which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [Islamic State, IS, ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups.§ \nThis constitutes proof that the Clinton Foundation knowingly accepting millions of dollars in ＆charitable＊ donations from the same Gulf states which both Secretary Clinton and President Obama knew were funding ISIS, Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria) and known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations. \nIn addition, the Clinton＊s Foundation took money from a number of other gulf monarchies: \n(Infographic: Conservative Post ) \nThis latest news validates what 21WIRE has been saying since the ＆ISIS crisis＊ began in June 2014. \nAccording to FOX News , FBI sources have said that ＆indictments are likely＊ for the Clinton Foundation investigation. One only wonders how this latest Assange revelation will factor into the wider investigation 每 as it goes right to the heart of the national security and foreign policy 每 two things which Clinton trades heavily on in her campaigning. \nAssange went on to explain the deep ramifications of this latest criminal allegation against Clinton and her family foundation: \n※All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some ※rogue§ princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.§ \nDuring their 25-minute interview filmed at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, Assange and Pilger discussed the obvious conflict of interest between Clinton as Secretary of State, the Clinton Foundation and Gulf monarchies who financed them. The following is an excerpt from the interview transcript: \nJohn Pilger: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly Saudi Arabia. \nJulian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton 每 and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it 每 the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value. \nJP: Of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation? \nJA: Yes. \nWatch a brief preview of the interview here: \nThe interview will air in full on RT International this Saturday Nov 5th. \nREAD MORE CLINTON NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Clinton Files \nSUPPORT 21WIRE 每 SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",

    "text": "21st Century Wire says＃ \nYesterday, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange confirmed what 21WIRE already knew 每 that Hillary Clinton and the Obama White House＊s claim of the US election process being ※hacked by the Russian government§ was a desperate work of fiction. Not content with that fish tale, Hillary Clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low (if that was even possible) with another, wilder made-up conspiracy story about the Russians. \nThe following statement made by Hillary Clinton yesterday epitomizes the term ※ jumping the shark ※: It's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia. https://t.co/D8oSmyVAR4 pic.twitter.com/07dRyEmPjX \n〞 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016 \nApparently, Hillary Clinton＊s campaign staff fed her a planted online news story (by the Clinton campaign?) which ran on a questionable pro-Democratic Party online news outlet. On Monday, the Slate ran the story by one of its alleged ※journalists§ named Franklin Foer , complete with a clickbait blog-like headline, ※Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?§ \nWhatever legitimacy the Slate had before last night, just evaporated. \nJohn Roberts from Forbes explains, ※The bottom line is that Slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place, and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season. As for Foer, he says on Twitter a ※follow up§ piece is in the works.§ \nRoberts rightly points out that the only follow-up story for this lemon should start with the word ※RETRACTION.§ \nCYBER FEUD: Assange believes Clinton has gone beyond the pale with her Russian conspiracy obsession. \nDuring his exclusive interview with award-winning filmmaker John Pilger, when asked what he thought of Hillary Clinton＊s shrill antics, Julian Assange said, ※ ※I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick.§ \nThe saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party 每 is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty. Like Hillary Clinton in her sociopathic path to power, the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess. \nStill, Clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate Clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower 每 with a decade-old misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of Donald Trump in a TMZ-style tabloid sting. That pretty much sums up Democratic Party strategy for this election season. \nAssange was right. Clinton, the Democratic Party and their surrogate, are eating themselves. Such are the spoils of power in Washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it. \nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \nSUPPORT 21WIRE 每 SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",

Calling Hillary Clinton a ※bigot§ has reporters asking every Republican in sight if Donald Trump has gone too far. But the Clinton campaign releases a video saying Mr. Trump is the candidate of the Ku Klux Klan, and it＊s all okey-dokey? \nThen again, Mr. Trump has already been likened to Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. Small wonder there＊s a collective ho-hum when Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says Mr. Trump is peddling ※KKK values.§ \nThis is what Democrats do. It didn＊t start with Mr. Trump, either. For years Democrats have portrayed the GOP as one giant hate group. \nEach presidential election, the drill goes like this: \nAfter Republicans nominate someone, he immediately finds himself having to prove he＊s not a hater 每 of African-Americans, of women, of gays, etc. \nThis year Democrats added a twist. Mr. Trump, they claim, represents a break with all those decent and lovable Republicans such as Mitt Romney , John McCain and George W. Bush . Of course, this isn＊t what they were saying back when these men were running for president. \n? In 2000, for example, an NAACP ad recreated the gruesome murder of James Byrd to imply that then-Gov. Bush was sympathetic to lynching black men. Over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck, Mr. Byrd＊s daughter says, ※So when Gov. George W. Bush refused to support hate-crimes legislation, it was like my father was killed all over again.§ \n? When John McCain ran in 2008, Barack Obama warned that Republicans would scare people by saying, ※You know, he doesn＊t look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.§ The McCain campaign fired back, accusing Mr. Obama of playing the race card from the ※bottom of the deck.§ Funny thing: All those reporters always hearing ※dog whistles§ from Republicans somehow didn＊t hear this one. \n? In 2012, when Mitt Romney went to the NAACP and told them face-to-face about his opposition to ObamaCare, the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote. Vice President Joe Biden put it more explicitly, telling a largely African-American audience that if Mr. Romney were to win, he＊d ※put ya＊ll back in chains.§ \nThe only difference today is that Republicans now have a nominee giving as good as he gets＃",

    "text": "BREAKING BOMBSHELL! FBI NYPD INSIDERS LEAK - Email Scandal About to Take a SICK and TWISTED Turn    \nSource: Victurus Libertas  \n\n\nAll of the following information was given to us by our insiders who have specific first-hand knowledge of the Hillary Clinton email scandal. It seems that things are about to heat up. We are told that of the 662,871 emails lifted from Anthony Weiner's computer, 11,112 emails are Huma Abedin's＃ and pay to play 每 including Saudis and Israelis. Meaning Huma was the one Hillary USED to communicate with foreign leaders via email for inside information and deals via Huma's computer. \n\nIt has been established through many avenues, but mainly through Wikileaks, that the Clinton Foundation was just a farce set up in order to perform pay-to-play games with multiple entities, including foreign nations. Pay-to-play nations include: Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Kazakhstan, and the Ukraine. \nFurthermore, we are told by one of our insiders that one email unequivocally confirms ISIS was created by CIA and Israeli Secret Intelligence Service , with help from Joe Lieberman, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham! An NYPD insider said the content they viewed did include State Department TOP SECRET emails. One file was called \"Life Insurance\". A second file was titled \" DNC Nuclear Arsenal \". \n\nA third file I'm sure Hillary definitely DOES NOT want released was a file labeled \"Intimate\" ＃ according to this NYPD insider, this file contained X-rated photos of Huma and Hillary with a TEENAGER . \n\nNYPD detectives were sickened by what they saw, according to our insider, and they had threatened FBI field agents that they would leak this information, if the FBI did not \"step up and take off the kid gloves\" . At that point, 13 of the FBI agents in NYC were also threatening to leak the information. \n\nAs you can imagine, the scandal has the entire Obama Administration in full panic. We are told there are emails that could send Loretta Lynch to prison , as well as Bill and Hillary. The Twitter post below, our sources sent us, verifying it is all true: \n\n\n\n\nEven MORE! \n\nThe following information comes straight from an FBI Anonymous source, who is the senior analyst who posted on 4chan in early July of this year: \n\nJim Comey learned that some of his own investigators were tipping off both Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton, thus making his job impossible. \n\nComey sent a letter to Congress, knowing that ultimately it would expose Loretta Lynch as a dirty actor and the breadcrumbs would lead directly to Obama . The State Department is terrified now. Comey has assembled a small team of 40 agents, whom he has declared \"The Untouchables\" after the famous federal agent Eliot Ness. \n\nComey has clamped down on all FBI agents and he expects a full-scale war between the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the White House, and the State Department. He has confirmed and understands that many sitting senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and power players are going to be indicted and prosecuted . One of the main targets of the probe is the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Among the targets under investigation are John Podesta, Huma, Cheryl Mills, CNN, ABC, NBC, etc. \n\nAs it turns out, Weiner, Huma's husband, had been forwarding Huma's emails each time she came home and left her computer open. Huma appears to have been in touch with Saudi actors, and therefore, ESPIONAGE is strongly suspected. \nComey and his 40 \" Untouchables \" are now preparing to take down the largest corruption ever witnessed in American history＃ which is what I think MUST happen if Comey is planning to stay part of the FBI. He lost so much respect and so much credibility with the first Hillary investigation, it would take something of this magnitude to allow him to face the public again. The Pentagon has internal players and outside players they call \" creatives \". Creatives are civilians who tend to be geniuses, malcontents, extreme hackers, or otherwise demonstrate brilliance in other useful areas. A Pentagon program called Cicada 3301 , which we have reported on previously, was created by several of these talented civilians. The program is now used to allow thousands of honest government people to report on their corrupt superiors, using what is called a DEAD BOX whistleblower encryption method so the non-corrupted government officials can report corruption and still remain safe. \n\nI've heard it said \"A vagina almost took down Bill, now will a Weiner take down Hillary?\" LOL! \n\nAgain, thank you to all of the insiders, the whistleblowers, the good FBI agents, the good CIA agents, the good NYPD officers, and the non-corrupted government officials who want to see the truth exposed! Without these brave, wonderful, and morally erect individuals, our country would still be in the corrupted darkness. \n\n\n\nVistors to Epstein's Little St. James Island include: \n\n? Ehud Barak , the former Prime Minister of Israel (1999-2001) 每 pedophile being procured underage girls by Epstein. Former Israeli Minister of Defense and also Deputy Israeli Prime Minister under Binyamin Netanyahu from 2009 to 2013. \n\n? Prince Andrew 每 British royalty 每 Jeffrey Epstein and his girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell pimped Epstein sex slave Virginia Roberts to Prince Andrew multiple times. The victim girls say Prince Andrew was very sexually sadistic; they despised this sick, twisted creature. \n\n? Kevin Spacey 每 actor in House of Cards. People tell me Spacey is gay, and my response is \"Have you ever heard of the word bisexual?\" Spacey is very good friends with 2 big-time pedophiles: Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton. Spacey, big Hollywood star, has 3.78 million Twitter followers. \n\n? Alan Dershowitz 每 longtime friend of Epstein, as well as one of his defense lawyers. Dershowitz was the one who negotiated that absurd plea bargain for Epstein that gave him a 13-month (served) sentence and a 16 hour/day day pass so he could spend most of his time in his mansion. Epstein sex slave Virginia Roberts has said that Epstein made her have sex with Dershowitz numerous times. The real question is how many other underage girls was Dershowitz having sex with? Virginia Roberts says Dershowitz also witnessed Epstein's pedophilic activities. \n\nhttp://victuruslibertas.com/2016/10/insiders-reveal-sex-ring/ \n\nRelated: \n\nAbel Danger - \"FBI INSIDER\" - Clinton Foundation Scandal Would Bring Down the Government and More   \n\nThe Situation Is So Intense, It Involves the Entire US Government | FBI Insider   \n\n*EXPLOSIVE* Q & A on the Clinton Foundation - FBI Insider on 4chan /pol/ : \"Ask Me Anything About the Clinton Case\" - George Soros Is the Kingpin - Follow the Rothschild Thread - Clinton Foundation Uses People as Currency - Jeffrey Epstein's Child Sex Trafficking Network - Bill & Hillary Clinton Get Paid in Money & Children - Hammer HRC's E-mails, Dig Into the CF: Post Everywhere You Can   \n\nI SIS stands for \"Israeli Secret Intelligence Service",

    "title": "An explanation for why the FBI re-opened Hillary's e-mails",
    "text": "Jimstone.is \nOctober 31 2016 \n\nHuma's husband, Anthony Weiner (which blows the whole Huma/Islam meme into the gutter; all we are seeing with this is the fact the \"Muslims\" running Saudi Arabia are crypto Jews) 每 ANYWAY , Hillary was so sure she'd never be called to account with her e-mails that she was careless enough to have them end up on Weiner's personal laptop in a file he titled \"life insurance\". \n\nWell, you know how the entire establishment is wrapped up in child sex and other similar crimes, and Weiner ended up getting his laptop seized by the NYPD in a kiddie porn/child sex investigation. When the NYPD went through the laptop, they found Hillary's e-mails in FULL UNADULTERATED PRISTINE FORM. They proved crimes of the highest order 每 at least 15 felonies found so far, with a majority of them related to treason and selling out the country. \n\nSO THE NYPD OPENED UP A CASE ON HILLARY. The FBI said, NO, WE'LL TAKE THAT 每 and that is the ONLY reason why these investigations got re-opened: because if the NYPD handled it, huge portions of the FBI would be sent to prison. Now the FBI is under pressure to actually do its job, because they know the NYPD knows. No matter what the outcome, the FBI gains zero (0) ZERO credibility points from this. \n\nSo read my report DO NOT FORGIVE : it was BANG ON, they did this because they HAD TO, not because they had any intention at all of being good, and it really is time to drain the swamp. \n\nNow let's all sit and wait for the suicide of Preet Bharara , the U.S. Prosecuting Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and the NYPD who pushed this into the light. He's now a target of the FBI, the DNC, the Clinton death machine and God knows what else. PREDICTION (and I do not make predictions): THE DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE NYPD WILL \"COMMIT SUICIDE\" WITHIN 5 DAYS. He's a walking dead man. \n\nThe circle of crime in Washington DC is so entrenched and so intertwined that if you poke one part of it, there is a good chance the whole show will fall apart. Poking that monster in a way that hurts is something I do not believe anyone will survive; Preet might as well call himself a zombie. \n\nThe NYPD TRUMPED the FBI! That is why they had to investigate Hillary! \n\nWell well, the NYPD is what busted the Hillary mails open while they were looking for kiddie stuff on Weiner's laptop, and THAT is why the FBI was forced to investigate Hillary. They had no choice. NYPD TRUMPS FBI!!! \n\nRelated: \n\nInsiders Threaten to Expose Hillary's Pedophile Sex Ring!!!",

    "title": "Who Is Peter Kadzik? The Clinton Ally and John Podesta's Very Close Friend Peter Kadzik Who Will Take Charge of DoJ's Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin Email Probe",
    "text": "Source: 70News \n\nOctober 31, 2016 Updated on November 1, 2016 \n\n? John Podesta: Kadzik was a \"fantastic lawyer\" who \"kept me out of jail.\" \n\n? Podesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. \n\n? Both were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta's birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik's son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. \n\n? Kadzik lobbied Podesta ( then WH Chief of Staff ) to pardon his billionaire, tax dodger fugitive client Marc Rich, whose wife gave $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. FBI Director James Comey is now trying to do the right thing and correct the deed cleaning up the mud he and Hillary Clinton put all over the face of FBI agency. By reopening Hillary Clinton's case, thanks to 650k-emails linked to sex scandal of Huma Abedin's husband Anthony Weiner and the mutiny of FBI agents who won't put up with Comey's crap, we are suppose to finally get justice. \n\nBut guess what? DOJ assigned a Clinton ally and John Podesta's very close friend Peter Kadzik to take charge of the new investigation. \n\nIn a letter to Congress, the DOJ writes that it \"will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,\" assistant attorney General Peter J. Kadzik writes in letters to House and Senate lawmakers. \n\nWHO IS PETER KADZIK? \n\nAccording to an excellent article published by DAILY CALLER: \n\nThe day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, the Democrat's campaign chairman, met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. \n\nThe dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state's email practices. \n\n\nPodesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta's birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik's son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. \n\nThe post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. \n\nKadzik, who started at the DOJ in 2013, helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. \n\nIn the trenches \n\nPodesta and Kadzik have a long history 〞 one which has largely gone unnoticed during the ongoing Clinton email scandal. \n\nKadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. \n\nThat history is cited by Podesta in another email hacked from his Gmail account. \n\nIn a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. \n\nPodesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a \"fantastic lawyer\" who \"kept me out of jail.\" \n\nPodesta had been promoted to Clinton＊s chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. \n\nKadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. \n\nTo help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. \n\nA House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that \"Kadzik was recruited into Marc Rich's lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.\" \n\nThe report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich＊s pardon. \n\nOn top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library.\n\nSOMETHING STINKS (again)! Peter J.

People will vote with their wallets. Looks like the people least likely to afford it get hit the hardest. time.com... Yet it＊s also true that for Americans who don＊t get insurance through work, and who make too much money to qualify for federal subsidies, the cost of health coverage is about to soar dramatically, with premiums sometimes rising $1,000, even over $2,000 for the year. If one were making 45k per year and the cost of a service increased 1k-2k for THAT year one would find other service providers or not use the service at all. But if you did not pay for health insurance you would owe the irs a penalty of 2k. Damned if you do Damned if you do not. 5% of someones income is alot, enough to make them think about who to vote for. a reply to: kruphix I am 27, never get ill, have low blood pressure, and am in good shape. My premiums doubled since this mess. So I ditched it. This was a redistribution of health care. link I don't understand why Trump hasn't been all over this opportunity. He should stop with the nonsense shooting himself in the foot crap and focus on this news to sway more voters to his side. Instead he has been babbling about his awesome golf course. It is times like these that make me think he must be taking a dive on purpose. originally posted by: Mr Headshot a reply to: kruphix Kinda going to spin off that, but isn't it funny that that is the argument being made by the left now? The poor and disaffected who don't get the insurance through their work (basically the people who were invoked to pass the bill) are going to, now, take the brunt of the hikes. Of course they will because they're the ones on the exchanges. One thing Hillary would like to do is provide more federal funding to get younger people signed up, to lower the risk pool and in turn lower premiums. Of course, the Republicans won't work with her on it because \"OBAMACARE,\" so who knows. I guess everyone is holding out for single payer, which is the inevitable result once the insurance industry collapses under the high cost of medical treatment. link a reply to: kruphix The people you are talking about that are effected by these premium hikes are a small minority that won't tilt the election one way or another. Yeah the people in the \"basket of deplorables\" are a small minority as well. Perhaps in your opinion they are all in the same basket. Nice to be told \"you're a amall minority\" your fate won't effect an election. originally posted by: kruphix a reply to: mobiusmale Most people get their insurance through their work, the next largest segment has Medicare/Medicaid. Those that get their insurance through the exchanges, not all of them are experiencing a large premium hike. The people you are talking about that are effected by these premium hikes are a small minority that won't tilt the election one way or another. But go ahead and think this will change blue states to red. cool, then abolishing the abortion that is \"Obamacare\" should be quick and easy. Then we can get insurance companies back to competing for our business and maybe get insurance back to where most people can afford it and not just those making less than $23k a year. You do realize that Obamacare is the single biggest failure in the history of the US last 8 years right? Much like a monkey #ing a football. link a reply to: mobiusmale It's going to cost Hilary some votes but is NOT going turn a blue state red. Might sway a poorer purple one toward red, but I'm unsure of what state fits that bill exactly. Fl maybe? a reply to: Greggers Of course, the Republicans won't work with her on it because \"OBAMACARE,\" so who knows. \"Work with her\"? really kind of like the dems worked with the gop to pass the ACA to begin with? Pass it before you read it? Like your plan keep your plan?

But go ahead and think this will change blue states to red. Considering you're talking about small and medium business owners who the current administration (and HRC) says they want to support, I am fairly certain the OP is accurate. The price hikes are a direct slap in the face to those of us that own our own small businesses and pay for insurance on our own. Shows how out of touch the top is with the middle. Employer sponsored rates are high too. It's cutting into employees' pay.

If they make any money at all, they will miss the subsidies and be paying the $500 to $800 a month the rest of us have to pay. The way it was before Obamacare was much much better for everyone except the one's with pre-existing conditions. It's a shame we couldn't have someone who was smart enough to grasp that. Then they could have just tried to fix that tiny slice of the population instead of jamming a broomstick up the rest of us. originally posted by: Mr Headshot a reply to: kruphix Kinda going to spin off that, but isn't it funny that that is the argument being made by the left now?

I mean what choice would she have, if she wants to keep some semblance of this disaster intact? The Obama/Clinton regime doubled the National Debt to over $20 trillion dollars in 8 yearts...how much deeper can that go before the whole bubble bursts? a reply to: Vasa Croe The price hikes are a direct slap in the face to those of us that own our own small businesses and pay for insurance on our own. That's right they forgot if you have less than 50 people employed you do not have to provide insurance to your employees. originally posted by: Mr Headshot a reply to: kruphix Kinda going to spin off that, but isn't it funny that that is the argument being made by the left now?

And where exactly does federal funding come from? *looks at wallet* No such thing as a free lunch. My healthcare costs have gone up almost 50% while benefits have gone down, and I'm on an employer provided plan. I'm 33yo and healthy as a horse. Healthcare is not a right, quit treating it as such. Get some actual competition in the system as well as some tort reform and maybe you'll see some improvement. Start jailing cronies and letting unprofitable companies fail you'll see some improvement.

    "title": "10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency",
    "text": "20 Shares\n17 2 0 1\nIn last issue of Black Agenda Report, I argued that readers should vote for the Green Party this November. This week, I will outline what to expect from a Hillary Clinton Presidency. The great migration of Republicans into the Democratic Party tent of Hillary Clinton has guaranteed her victory in the highly undemocratic US Presidential elections. Corporate media outlets have collaborated with Clinton to instill deep popular fear of a Trump administration. Fear of Trump has been used to distract the many millions of people in the US who are fed up with both corporate parties. This has led to a lack of investigation and analysis of what can be expected once Hillary Clinton actually takes office.\nThe corporate media has exploited the general population's distaste for sexism and white supremacy in the process. Trump has made heinous statement after heinous statement, all of which should be taken seriously by anyone who calls themselves a movement activist. It is critical that the left in the US extend solidarity to those who experience the consequences of racism and sexism every day. However, Trump's vile character has been used as a means to legitimize the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. His characterization as a fascist has convinced many that his rule would be a greater danger to humanity than a Clinton Presidency.\nOne could endlessly debate Clinton supporters on the validity of such a claim. Trump's vulgar and putrid presentation has provided Clinton supporters with a convenient weapon of defense against all criticism of their own vile choice. Yet the lesser evil argument has never been weaker than in the 2016 elections. It is reasonable to assume that a Hillary Clinton Presidency will be far less effective than Obama in effecting capitalist and imperialist hegemony. This is why her support system, the entire ruling class, has gone into overdrive to spread fear of a Russia-Trump collaborative threat in every sphere of US political life.\nHere are ten things to expect from a Clinton Presidency. I will leave it to readers to judge as to whether Clinton represents a \"lesser evil\" than Trump or just plain evil.\n1.) The Privatization of Social Security - Hillary Clinton has stated publicly and privately to her Wall Street friends that she will reignite conversations to downsize the program. Wikileaks exposed Clinton's support for the Obama's Administration's \"deficit reduction\" commission that originally proposed cuts to entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare in 2012. Clinton donors on Wall Street have made it clear that they would love to get a hold of Social Security earnings and turn them into a financial market to be traded for profit.\nMORE... Hillary Clinton must be indicted How Hillary Clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital Voting for the ※Lesser Evil§ John Pilger: Clinton policies will bring great aggression to the US and the world 2.) World War III - Hillary Clinton has stated in nearly every debate that her administration would consider placing a no-fly zone in Syria. That means US airstrikes would rain down on Syrian and Russian assets in Syria. Such a move would place the US military in direct confrontation with the Russia. Clinton has been caught stating that the Syrian and Russian lives that will die in such a conflict are well worth the benefits.\n3.) The Transpacific Partnership - Often called \"NAFTA on steroids,\" the massive corporate trade agreement that captures much of Asia Pacific region has been a major talking point in the 2016 elections. Clinton has supported the agreement in the past, only to switch her position due to pressure from the Bernie Sanders campaign. With Sanders firmly in the Clinton camp, there is currently nothing in the way to stop Clinton from moving forward with the TPP's passage and making her private position on the deal a public reality.\n4.) Maintenance and Expansion of the Surveillance State - Not much needs to be said here. The Obama Administration's vast expansion of the surveillance state has been exposed by the likes of Ed Snowden and Julian Assange. Wikileaks additionally revealed Clinton's desire to drone Julian Assange for releasing Washington＊s secrets to the public. A Clinton Presidency has every intention of following up on the Obama Administration's passage of bills such as the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012. This bill gave the US government the right to militarily detain \"terror\" suspects indefinitely.\n5.) Trump's Wall - Hillary Clinton was Obama's Secretary of State from 2009-2013. Over this time, she helped facilitate the largest deportation of undocumented people in US history. Furthermore, she oversaw the detention of thousands of Central American children during the great migration from the 2009 fascist coup in Honduras, a coup that was drawn up by Clinton herself. The US-Mexico border is more militarized than it has ever been. Trump's wall rhetoric was indeed a racist trip, but too few recognize that something just as dangerous actually exists under current US immigration policy.\n6.) Servitude to the Bankers - Hillary Clinton has received over forty million in support from Hedge funds in the 2016 elections. Before selling out, Bernie Sanders made it a point to request public access into Clinton's private, quarter million dollar speeches to banks like Goldman Sachs. The deregulation of the banks with the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act was a Clinton project. Both her current list of donors and past connection to her husband＊s policies make her the obvious choice for the finance capitalist class.\n7.) Maintenance of the Mass Black Incarceration State - Hillary Clinton is the enemy of Black America. From her callous use of the term \"super predator\" to describe working class Black men to being the architect of the 1994 crime bill, the Clinton dynasty virtually built the mass Black incarceration state. Under Bill and Hillary Clinton's two terms, the prison population rose by 673,000. This was facilitated by draconian \"three strikes\" laws, mandatory drug sentence, and the deep militarization of local police departments. With her record, it isn't too difficult to assume what another four years of Clinton rule will bring in the realm of policing and prisons.\n8.) Austerity and More Austerity - It was the first Clinton Administration that eliminated \"welfare as we know it.\" The evisceration of Aid to Families and Dependent Children (AFDC) and its replacement, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), threw millions of women and children into poverty. Obama has followed up with draconian cuts to SNAP (foodstamps). There is nothing on Clinton's track record that indicates her administration would do anything but roll back whatever social programs and protections still exist for the poor in the US.\n9.) A Boost to the Privatization of Education - Hillary Clinton received boos in July when she urged teachers' unions and charter operators to \"work together\" for the greater good of students. Ever since, Clinton has attempted to exploit the rise of Sanders by courting teachers unions to endorse her. Her position has slightly softened on the privatization of education, but that hardly matters. Clinton receives broad support from school privatizers (like Wal-Mart) and should not be expected to roll back the \"shock and awe\" war on public education waged by the Obama Administration.\n10.) An Economic Crisis - Bankers and economists have been predicting an economic crash for much of 2016. Capitalists everywhere were given free rein to \"recover\" with trillions in stimulus cash after sending the entire global capitalist economy into collapse in 2008. The internal contradictions of the system are only sharpening as workers become poorer and global production stagnates. Whether Clinton can manage a crisis in service of the capitalists as well Obama has remains to be seen.\nClinton may very well be the highest expression of ruling class consensus that has ever presented itself in an election season. Her political record represents a greater material threat to humanity than Donald Trump for the sheer fact that she is the preferred candidate of the ruling class. The question now is whether mass sentiment exists to organize around an alternative to the two-party corporate duopoly. Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka are attempting to build the base of the Green party ticket. Whatever method is chosen, it must be wielded to combat lesser evil politics and build an organized force ready to struggle against the intensified suffering that will surely be imposed on the world by a Clinton Administration.",

    "text": "Bill Clinton and his cabinet members pursued Anti-India activities and as Secretary of State Hillary did the same. As President, she will no doubt continue to bully India. 7 Shares\n7 0 0 0\nThere are only weeks left until we find out if we have a President Trump or a President Clinton. Donald Trump is perceived as the candidate who is against the corrupt establishment, while Hillary Clinton is seen as part and fabric of the establishment and as the most corrupt candidate to run for President in the history of the country.\nA President Clinton in a few weeks would return us to the hostile climate towards India that we saw in the 1990s overseen by her husband. After he took office in 1993 the US relationship with India went on a considerable down-slide. For nearly a year, Clinton did not bother appointing an ambassador to India even as he went about opposing India on multiple fronts, leading to anger in the Indian establishment. Initially he was intent on disarming and weakening India by preventing access to technology and also mounted a sustained attack on the Indian economy by imposing several economic sanctions.\nIn 1991, Senator Joe Biden, who is now the Vice President under Barack Obama, introduced an amendment in the bill granting aid to Russia, making the aid conditional on the fact that Russia could not sell cryogenic engines for India's space programme. The Clinton administration was hellbent on hurting the development of India's space and technology sectors and blocked the sale of Cray supercomputers that had been approved under the Ronald Reagan administration. India was also targeted for several economic sanctions and was threatened under what was called the Super 301 clause of the American trade law.\nThese economic sanctions were specifically borne out in the way Mr Clinton attacked the Indian textile and carpet industries. Throughout the 1990s, the terms \"Dunkel Draft\", \"Super 301\", \"WTO\" and \"patent laws\" became synonyms for the US attempts to retard the Indian economy and led to many protests in India.\nBy 1996, India was justified in believing that Indo-US relations had hit the lowest point, but things took a dramatic turn for the worse during Bill Clinton's second term in office. Madeleine Albright became the new Secretary of State and she was increasingly hostile to India especially through her pseudo-racist television outbursts. In fact she loved attacking India so much she went at it after leaving office and called for a plebiscite in Kashmir, justifying the actions of violent groups in the process.\nMORE... Clinton's Policies Look Like a Death Sentence for Americans 10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency Hillary Clinton must be indicted How Hillary Clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital Remember this is the same blood-soaked Albright who advocated bombing Yugoslavia and then got her investment firm to attempt a takeover of mines in that country. Like the Clintons, she also knows how to abuse her power. Lest we forget, Albright also justified the deaths of half a million Iraqi children and claimed that the deaths were \"worth it\". And the icing on the cake for this particularly nasty woman? Albright has already threatened women in America and claimed that there was a special place in hell reserved for them if they did not vote for Hillary Clinton.\nThere is already talk of Joe Biden in the frame as Secretary of State under Hillary Clinton. Biden would continue his anti-India agenda and try to thwart the development of India's space programme and other technological advancements. Then of course there is Hillary's closest confidante, a duplicitous lady called Huma Abedin who is of Pakistani descent and whose family has links to radical elements in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Abedin could end up playing an important role in determining American foreign policy and would be certainly anti-Modi.\nAnother point against Hillary Clinton is that the hawkish Henry Kissinger has supports her and her oeuvre as Secretary of State. This is the same Kissinger who is so hostile against India, many of his racist statements are even on tape to that end.\nIt is in the light of this setting that many Indian-Americans have opposed the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and have come out in support of Donald Trump. In contrast to the policies of the Clintons, Trump has promised to make India the best friend of the US and has stated that he looks forward to working with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump has also reached out to Hindus in US. While there is always a risk of the unknown and it is not clear if Trump can make the change he wants to, a Hillary presidency will certainly be a major step back for India.\nIn order for India to build a constructive relationship with US, it requires people in both countries to have good intentions. It is clear that India cannot have a strong and forward looking relationship with the US if Hillary Clinton is running the corridors of power. On the other hand, Donald Trump has articulated the right intent and his stance holds promise for India.",

    "text": "Sean Brown AMERICA＊S FREEDOM FIGHTERS 每 \nWikileaks has revealed some rather troubling things about Hillary Clinton and her staffers, but perhaps the most disturbing, a bizarre, is the fact that John Podesta is involved with satanic rituals. \nNo, this isn＊t fiction and I＊m not wearing tin foil on my head. An email released by Wikileaks reveals Podesta was invited to a ※spirit cooking dinner§ by performance artist Marina Abramovic, and you can rest assured that it＊s not anything like it sounds. \n※I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina,§ an email dated June 28, 2015 read. \nShortly after, the emails, which was sent to Podesta＊s brother Tony, was forwarded to john with the message, ※Are you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner.§ \nNow you＊re probably wondering what all the fuss is about, and I seriously can＊t blame you. So let＊s turn to Paul Joseph Watson from InfoWars for a little background on what this ※spirit cooking§ is really all about. \nSpirit cooking refers to ※a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley§ and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a ※painting§. \nAccording to Marina Abramovic, if the ritual is performed in an art gallery, it is merely art, but if the ritual is performed privately, then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony. \nThe video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony. Abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the ※recipe§ for the ※painting,§ which is comprised of the words, ※With a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain.§ \nThe ceremony is, ※meant to symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine, which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism ※As Above, So Below.§ \nBelow is a video of Abramovic conducting the satanic ritual: \nHow creepy. Even creepier is the same woman holding a bloody goat＊s head 每 a representation of the Satanist symbol Baphomet.

    "text": "Black Turnout Soft in Early Voting, Boding Ill for Hillary Clinton Jeremy Peters et al., New York Times, November 1, 2016 \nAfrican-Americans are failing to vote at the robust levels they did four years ago in several states that could help decide the presidential election, creating a vexing problem for Hillary Clinton as she clings to a deteriorating lead over Donald J. Trump with Election Day just a week away. \n{snip} \nThe reasons for the decline appear to be both political and logistical, with lower voter enthusiasm and newly enacted impediments to voting at play. In North Carolina, where a federal appeals court accused Republicans of an ※almost surgical§ assault on black turnout and Republican-run election boards curtailed early-voting sites, black turnout is down 16 percent . White turnout, however, is up 15 percent. Democrats are planning an aggressive final push, including a visit by President Obama to the state on Wednesday. \nBut in Florida, which extended early voting after long lines left some voters waiting for hours in 2012, African-Americans＊ share of the electorate that has gone to the polls in person so far has decreased , to 15 percent today from 25 percent four years ago. \nThe problems for Democrats do not end there. In Ohio, which also cut back its early voting, voter participation in the heavily Democratic areas near Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo has been down, though the Clinton campaign said it was encouraged by a busy day on Sunday when African-American churches led voter drives across the state. \n{snip} \nThe Clinton campaign believes it can close the gap, especially in North Carolina and Florida, by Election Day. And Democrats are seeing substantial gains in turnout for other key constituencies like Hispanics and college-educated women, which have the potential to more than make up for any drop-off in black voting. \n{snip}",

    "title": "How Hillary Courts the Black Vote",
    "text": "Posted on November 6, 2016 How Hillary Courts the Black Vote Ethnomasochism reaches a new low. \nThe Democratic presidential primary was one of unprecedented pandering for the non-white vote. As The Guardian summed up one of the debates: ※Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders made a conspicuous play for Latino and African American voters.§ Mrs. Clinton won the ※conspicuous play§ hands down, and with it, the nomination. The failure of Senator Sanders to win the necessary quotient of non-white votes was repeatedly pointed out by the chattering class up until the time he dropped out. \nIn February one black commenter pointedly wrote that Sen. Sanders, ※has many miles to go to convince black voters that he can fight for our interests.§ By May, black commenter Steven Thrasher wrote a piece titled, ※ Bernie Sanders isn＊t winning minority votes 每 and it＊s his own fault .§ Mr. Thrasher identified Sen. Sanders＊s problem as ※failing to talk about racism at every turn.§ \nThis accusation may seem ludicrous, since Sen. Sanders surrendered his stage to Black Lives Matter activists several times. But in comparison to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Thrasher was right about Sen. Sanders. No mainstream candidate in the history of the United States has more thoroughly debased himself in the quest for the black vote than Mrs. Clinton. Since this helped her win the Democratic nomination, she has continued the strategy. In the few days remaining before November 8th, let＊s take a look at Hillary Clinton＊s most ethnomasochistic moments. \n1) In January of 2016, Mrs. Clinton was at something called the Iowa Brown and Black Forum (with none other than Jorge Ramos ), where she was asked ※Can you tell us what the term ＆white privilege＊ means to you? And can you give me an example from your life or career when you think you have benefitted from it?§ This is how she began her answer: \nWhere do I start? I think it is hard when you are swimming in the ocean to know exactly what is happening around you so much as it is when you＊re standing on the shore perhaps watching . . . . I was born white, middle-class, in the middle of America. . . . \n2) Early in the Democratic nomination, Mrs. Clinton＊s campaign released a memo aimed at stifling the rising momentum of Bernie Sanders: \n[W]hereas the electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire are largely rural/suburban and predominantly white, the March [primary] states better reflect the true diversity of the Democratic Party and the nation . . . . It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among African American and Hispanic voters. We believe that＊s how it should be. emphasis added \n3) Shortly before the South Carolina primary, at Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, Mrs. Clinton explained how to break down barriers for African Americans: \nEnding systemic racism requires contributions from all of us〞especially those of us who haven＊t experienced it ourselves. White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day. \nWe need to recognize our privilege and practice humility, rather than assume that our experiences are everyone＊s experiences. All of us need to bring our skills to bear〞and especially young people coming up today, who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems. \n4) In April of 2016, while on a back radio show, Mrs. Clinton was asked what she always carries in her bag. She immediately answered, ※hot sauce.§ When one of the black hosts noted that she would be accused of pandering to black people for giving that answer, she asked hopeully, ※Is it working?§ \n5) Just a few weeks after a Black Lives Matter supporter murdered five police officers , the Democratic National Convention that convened to nominate Mrs. Clinton passed a resolution, no doubt with her approval, supporting Black Lives Matter : \n[T]he DNC joins with Americans across the country in affirming ＆Black lives matter＊ and the ＆say her name＊ efforts to make visible the pain of our fellow and sister Americans as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed African American men, women and children. \nWhite politicians have tried to win elections through public displays of ethnomasochism for decades, but this election has set a new low. And if Mrs. Clinton loses, her pandering could live on in another form. As the Black Lives Matter activist Tef Poe explained , if Mr. Trump wins, ※young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go . . . ain＊t no more rules. We＊ve been too nice as is.§",

    "text": "Hillary Reboots ＆Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy＊ Playbook 10/31/2016 \nLIFEZETTE \nBefore even 24 hours had passed since the FBI director informed Congress on Friday that it was reopening the probe into Hillary Clinton＊s emails, Clinton suggested the director was in cahoots with the Republican Party. \n※We＊ve made it very clear that, if they are going to be sending this kind of letter that is only going originally to Republican members of the House, that they need to share whatever facts they claim to have with the American people,§ Clinton said on Friday, after initially being blindsided by the FBI＊s announcement. \nThe claim wasn＊t true. All you had to do is turn the page and find Democratic members of Congress who had also received the letter from the FBI. But it shows how ready Clinton is to fight anyone in the government who dares investigate or question her. It is likely a habit Clinton picked up when she was first lady, from 1993 to 2001. \nClinton＊s opening salvo, though weak, is a sign of more to come. Her coming attack on the FBI and its director, James Comey, will likely begin in earnest on Monday, with her operatives using the letter to Congress as proof Clinton is the victim of a political conspiracy. \nClinton previewed her attack in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Saturday, when she said the letter was ※unprecedented and deeply troubling.§ \nClinton will also turn the issue into one of ※transparency§ 〞 even though FBI investigations are inherently not transparent. In Daytona, she called on Comey to ※explain everything right away, put it all right on the table§ 〞 a demand she knows will go unheeded. \nBut many of Clinton＊s allies in the media are likely to demand to see the emails found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner＊s laptop. \nIt＊s a strategy that could work, even with only a few days left until Election Day. \nSuch attacks on law enforcement worked fairly well for Clinton in 1998, when she and her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, vilified independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Starr had been tasked by Bill Clinton＊s own attorney general to investigate corruption charges, but likely rued the day he ever took the job. \nIn 1994, Bill Clinton faced questions from many, including The New York Times, about an investment the Clintons made in a company called Whitewater Development Corp. Bill Clinton＊s attorney general, Janet Reno, made Robert Fiske the independent counsel. \nFiske would later be replaced by Starr. Starr＊s investigation would later reach into charges that President Clinton had lied in the Paula Jones sexual harassment civil trial. With explosive charges being published by the Drudge Report and Newsweek in January 1998 that Bill Clinton had seduced an intern, Monica Lewinsky, the Clintons could have been expected to admit the truth and take the punishments. \nInstead, the Clinton White House and the Democrats began attacking Starr and the Republicans. \nOn Jan. 27, 1998, Hillary Clinton went on NBC＊s ※The Today Show§ and goaded the press into covering the opposition rather than President Bill Clinton, who had lied about his affair with Lewinsky just one day earlier. \nMatt Lauer asked if Hillary Clinton had said the fight against Starr would be the ※last great battle§ of the Clinton White House. \n※Well, I don＊t know if I＊ve been that dramatic,§ Hillary Clinton replied. ※But I do believe that this is a battle. I mean, look at the very people who are involved in this 〞 they have popped up in other settings. This is 〞 the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.§ \nThe Starr report on the Clinton scandals was released months later. But what the Clintons are really proud of that is that the Democrats actually gained seats in the 1998 midterm elections, helping to cause a backfire against the GOP. \nThe GOP didn＊t have anywhere near the two-thirds majority in the Senate to remove Bill Clinton. In early 1999, the U.S. Senate acquitted Bill Clinton on two charges: obstruction of justice, and perjury. \nIt taught the Clintons the wrong lesson: to fight authorities if authorities questioned them 〞 even authorities within the Democratic Party. Clinton will be targeting and attacking President Obama＊s own FBI director as Obama leaves office.",

Hillary hints at second civil war if Trump wins 11/02/2016 \nWhile speaking to supporters in Cincinnati on Monday, Democrat Hillary Clinton hinted at a second civil war if GOP nominee Donald Trump wins, Breitbart.com reported. \nCharlie Spiering wrote: \n※He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart,§ Clinton said to supporters in Cincinnati, Ohio on Halloween. \nClinton specifically referred to the Civil War, suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from Donald Trump. \n※Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges 每 the challenge posed by slavery 每 and we fought a civil war,§ she said. \nShe warned voters that it was time for the country to take the divisions in the country seriously. \n※But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together,§ she added, failing to admit that her side is the one that has divided America by race, class and gender. \nShe also claimed that Trump would start a nuclear war if a foreign leader got under his skin. \n※I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don＊t think so,§ she said at a rally in Kent, Ohio, earlier in the day. \nA post at Barracuda Brigade observed: \nLiberals especially the Clinton are always projecting.

    "text": "Opinion: Hillary is the Whore of Babylon and is not Human 11/06/2016 \nTRACY TWYMAN \nI put some of this information in an article I published yesterday morning about a larger subject. Today I have decided to isolate these segments and add more for a comprehensive piece on the subject because other relevant information has emerged. \nPeople in the FBI think Hillary Clinton is the Anti-Christ . They are close. She is the Whore of Babylon. \nHillary was born in 1948, supposedly. I looked for this information on a hunch, after noticing several clues. And sure enough, back in 2008, someone on David Icke＊s forum speculated that Hillary may have been the ※Moonchild§ that, according to artist Marjorie Cameron , was implanted into her own womb by rocket scientist, occultist, and Crowley associate Jack Parsons during a ritual called the ※ Babalon Working .§ The purpose was to birth a child to be an incarnation of what Crowley called ※ Babalon ,§ the Scarlet Whore with the cup of blood foretold in St. John＊s Revelation that rides the Beast. \nCameron actually claimed that this fetus, after being taken from her womb, was delivered to people involved in the military＊s nuclear weapons progranm, who were apparently in cahoots with Parsons, and placed inside of a nuclear bomb that was tested. But the fetus ※survived,§ she said, because it had been placed inside of a special canister made exactly for this purpose. For the 1945 ※Trinity§ bomb test they made a special canister called ※Jumbo§ that was supposed to to preserve the plutonium if the bomb did failed to go off. They reportedly didn＊t end up using it for that, but it has been suggested that this is what preserved the fetus of the Moonchild. Presumably, it grew up to be somebody. \nCrowley named one of his female consorts (who he always called his ※Scarlet Women§) ※Hilarion.§ Her name was Jeanne Foster. Crowley＊s attempt to conceive an heir as a ※magical child§ with Hilarion resulted, supposedly, in the child＊s spirit being attached to his protege Charles Stanfield Jones back in 1909. The ※attachment§ allegedly occurred when Jones went through the ritual for ※Crossing the Abyss§ in the 11th degree of the O.T.O., which involves being ritually sodomized by everyone in the group. \nJack Parsons, another person who had willingly subjected himself to this ritual, channeled The Book of the Antichrist in 1949, where he foretold: \nAnd within seven years of this time, BABALON, THE SCARLET WOMAN HILARION will manifest among ye, and bring this my work to its fruition. \nI also believe that Hillary, with her notorious cracking voice, and possibly her rival Trump, were foretold in another document channeled by Parsons, the Book of Babalon : \nHer voice is sure as the judgement trump to crack the house of wrong, Though walls are high and stone is hard and the rule of hell was long The gates shall fall and the irons break in the Birth of BABALON. \nIn Rome the Hilaria was a festival to the goddess Cybele (worshipped in the form of a black meteorite stone) to celebrate the ※resurrection§ of her son, who, as the legend states, she had been having sex with. She then became jealous of his love of others, castrated him, and let him die of bleeding (the reason why all of her priests, the Galli, were castrated, and actually considered women). She later regretted this and caused him to be brought back to life, then forced everyone under her rule to celebrate by laughing and partying joyously, as commemorated in this festival. Consider this next time you notice Hillary Clinton laughing ※inappropriately.§ \nAlso note that Hillary Clinton has made several self-depricating jokes about herself being ※ not even human § and ※short-circuiting§ when she gets herself twisted up in her own lies. Specifically, in October 2015, when her interviewer at Buzzfeed noted that she seemed to not be sweating, even though it was a hot day (odd, because Hillary has notoriously bad B.O.), she asked Hillary what kind of deodorant she used. Clinton＊s reply was astounding. \nYou guys are the first to realize that I＊m really not even a human being. I was constructed in a garage in Palo Alto a very long time ago＃ I mean, a man whose name shall remain nameless created me in his garage. \nPalo Alto is the location of Stanford University, Jack Parsons＊ Alma Mater.",

    "text": "Hillary Clinton in lead a day before Election Day 11/07/2016 \nPRESS TV \nDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads her Republican rival by three percentage points nationally as they head into the final day of a tight race for the White House, according to a new poll. \nThe final Bloomberg Politics-Selzer & Co poll released on Monday has Clinton ahead of Trump, 44 percent to 41 percent. \nLibertarian candidate Gary Johnson was at 4 percent and Green Party candidate Jill Stein had 2 percent support. \nClinton also leads Trump by three points in a hypothetical two-way matchup when third-party candidates are not included. \nAnother tracking poll released early on Monday also put Clinton in the lead. \nThe former secretary of state held a four-point lead over the billionaire businessman in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll. The survey showed 47 percent of likely US voters backed Clinton while 43 percent said they supported Trump. \nThe Clinton campaign received a late break with FBI Director James Comey announcing Sunday that no criminal charges were forthcoming in the probe of Clinton＊s newly-found emails. \n※Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July,§ the FBI chief wrote in a new letter to congressional committee chairmen. \nThe development is a major relief to Clinton, who is spending the final hours of her campaign trying to close Trump＊s path to presidency. Donald Trump walks off the stage after holding a rally at Loudoun Fairgrounds in Leesburg, Virginia, early in the morning on November 7, 2016. (Photo by AFP) \nComey sent the presidential race into a frenzy last month when he sent a letter to Congress saying the FBI had discovered emails in a separate probe that could be linked to the investigation into Clinton＊s use of a private server when she was secretary of state. \nThe surprise move infuriated Democrats and lifted the presidential hopes of Trump, who has turned the email controversy into a favorite line of attack against Clinton. \nStill, Trump continued to seize on the email issue, insisting that Clinton is ※guilty.§ \n※Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know,§ he said Sunday at a rally in Detroit, Michigan. ※And now it＊s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8.§ \nBoth Clinton and Trump plan to spend the last day of the campaign racing across key battleground states that could determine the results of Tuesday＊s election. \nTrump will visit Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire and finish the day with a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. \nClinton is travelling to Pennsylvania and Michigan before closing with a midnight-rally in Raleigh, North Carolina.",

Blaise: I was inspired to make the song because I felt very disenfranchised by the way Bernie Sanders sparked such an incredible movement but was completely ignored by the media and given no shot. Yet according to Election Justice USA , without the primaries being fixed, Sanders could have won by a landslide. I felt so cheated when he lost.

    "title": "Two Points About the Hillary Clinton Email Fiasco",
    "text": "Much is being made of Hillary Clinton＊s private email server, which she used when she was Secretary of State. To me, the real issue is not that Hillary endangered national security by sending classified information in the clear. No 每 the real issue is that the Clintons act as if they are above the rules and laws that apply to ※the little people.§ They are superior and smug, totally devoted to themselves and their pursuit of power and the privileges that come with it. It＊s a matter of character, in other words. Hillary＊s evasiveness, her lack of transparency, her self-righteousness, her strong sense of her own rectitude, make her a dangerous candidate for the presidency.\nMy second point is this: The issue of classification should be turned on its head. The real issue is not that Hillary potentially revealed secrets. No 每 the real issue is that our government keeps far too much from us. Our government uses security classification not so much to keep us safe, but to keep the national security state safe 每 safe from the eyes of the American people.\n\nAs The Guardian reported in 2013 :\n※A committee established by Congress, the Public Interest Declassification Board, warned in December that rampant over-classification is ＆imped[ing] informed government decisions and an informed public＊ and, worse, ＆enabl[ing] corruption and malfeasance＊. In one instance it documented, a government agency was found to be classifying one petabyte of new data every 18 months, the equivalent of 20m filing cabinets filled with text.§\nNowadays, seemingly everything is classified. And if it＊s classified, if it＊s secret, we can＊t know about it. Because we can＊t be trusted with it. That＊s a fine idea for an autocracy or dictatorship, but not so fine for a democracy.\nGovernment of the people, by the people, for the people? Impossible when nearly everything of any importance is classified.\nToo bad Hillary didn＊t send everything in the clear 每 what a service she would have done for the American people and for democracy!\nWilliam J.

    "title": "How Hillary Clinton Poisoned American Politics",
    "text": "How Hillary Clinton Poisoned American Politics Crazy conspiracy theories dominate the final days before Nov. 8 Share This \nFBI Director James Comey＊s decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s mishandling of classified information has the Clintonites falling back on their tried-and-true response to all the revelations coming from WikiLeaks and other sources 每 it＊s all a Russian plot. Except, this time, the hysteria has reached such a fever pitch, and the conspiracy theories are so unhinged, that the political discourse in this country will be poisoned for years to come. \nIt started with Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who told CNN＊s Wolf Blitzer: \n※So the question is: Where did these [emails] come from? How did they get to the FBI? Is Russia involved in this? We don＊t have a clue where this stuff is coming from.§ \nWe don＊t know if Ryan was drunk ( again ) when he said this, but his nickname of ※ Congressman Moonbeam § seems well-earned, and the implication of his remarks 每 that the FBI is in league with the Russians 每 underscores his marginality. However, it wasn＊t long before the marginal started merging with the mainstream. In tandem with Rya, Howard Dean, former presidential candidate and once head of the Democratic party, tweeted : \n※Ironically, Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.§ \nNow Dean may be a bit more credible than Ryan, but who can forget the ※ Dean scream § that dramatized his loonier side, and effectively knocked him out of contention for the Democratic presidential nomination? And then there were those payments from the Mujahideen-e-Khalq , a nutty Marxist-Islamist cult, in return for serving as their front man. And so while Dean may be better known, what he＊s know for isn＊t exactly adding to his credibility, and so we can safely relegate this kind of conspiracy theorizing to the fringes of the Democratic party spectrum. Right? \nWrong. Here is longtime Clintonite strategist James Carville opining that ※It＊s unprecedented ＃ the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy.§ Well, okay, who listens to Carville, anyway? He＊s so yester day! Well, then, get a load of Harry Reid, who leads the Senate＊s Democrats, repeating a different version of the same nonsense in a letter to Comey : \n\"In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government 每 a foreign interest hostile to the united states, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.\" \nIt＊s so ※explosive§ that it exploded into utter nothingness, according to the New York Times this [Tuesday] morning: \n※For much of the summer, the F.B.I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead 每 which they ultimately came to doubt 每 about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. \n※Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, FBI and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.§ \nAs Gertrude Stein once put it, ※There＊s no there there.§ She was talking about Oakland, California, but might just as well have been describing the inside of Harry＊s brain. \nAnd, yes, you read the above cited Times story right: instead of going after terrorists, or ordinary criminals, for months the FBI has been chasing down rabbit holes looking for Trump＊s alleged links to the nonexistent International Kremlin/Alt-Right/Putinist Conspiracy. We have returned to the halcyon days of J. Edgar Hoover, when people were investigated and harassed for their political views at the instigation of their ideological opponents. \nOh, but the FBI was too ※ overburdened and undermanned § to keep Omar Mateen on their radar. \nIn this election, the tragic and the comic mix and merge, but surely the former is dominant in the latest of Franklin Foer＊s Russophobic effusions. Formerly the editor of The New Republic , who was unceremoniously dumped by its new owner, Foer has teamed up with the Clinton campaign as its unofficial conspiracy theorist, spinning tales of Trump＊s ※links§ to the Russians. He＊s the Alex Jones of the Clinton crowd, except that not even Jones would be caught dead promoting the kind of incoherent nonsense in Foer＊s latest screed . \nAccording to Foer, Trump has a ※secret server§ set up specifically to communicate with his Kremlin Masters. We know this because a ※computer scientist§ who wants to be known only as ※Tea Leaves,§ and other ※experts§ 每 who also don＊t want to tell us their names 每 have supposedly ※discovered§ this Secret Link. The server connects to the Alfa Bank, which is located in 每 cue in scary music 每 Russia! And guess what!? This closed communication link was especially active during politically sensitive times! This, according to Foer and his anonymous band of ※experts,§ is conclusive proof that The Donald is a secret agent of the KGB, intent on polluting our precious bodily fluids with icky Russian cooties. \nThe only problem with this wacky conspiracy theory is that there＊s a prosaic explanation for the existence of this ※suspicious§ online traffic: the Trump Organization had hired a company to send out ads for their hotels. The online traffic to Alfa Bank meant only that several employees of that bank had stayed in Trump＊s hotels and were being solicited to do so again. And in spite of the ※scientific§-looking chart displayed in the Foer piece, in fact the online traffic to and from Alfa didn＊t ※peak§ when the US political scene got hot: ※That＊s wrong,§ writes Timothy B. Lee in the anti-Trump pro-Hillary Vox.com. ※If anything, the chart shows the opposite of that.§ \nAs Lee puts it: \n※ Foer claims that the pattern of traffic between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank servers is highly unusual 每 so unusual that it can best be explained as a secretive communication link between Donald Trump and the Kremlin. \n※But in this case, there seems to be a plausible and perfectly innocent explanation for the traffic pattern suggested by an IT consultant named Naadir Jeewa and endorsed by security expert Robert Graham : The Trump organization is sending out promotional emails about Trump hotels, and one or more Alfa Bank employees is on the recipient list. \n※This is actually the explanation that＊s suggested by Occam＊s razor because 每 as Foer himself acknowledges in his story 每 the server was originally registered by an email marketing firm called Cendyn. The Trump organization seems to have hired Cendyn to send out emails promoting Trump＊s hotels, a service Cendyn has been providing since the Trump server was registered in 2009. So the most obvious explanation for the traffic is that Cendyn is using its server for its intended purpose.§ \nWhen Hillary Clinton＊s Twitter account tweeted Foer＊s farrago and declared ※It＊s time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia,§ cyber-security expert Robert Graham replied on his blog : \n※This is nonsense. The evidence available on the Internet is that Trump neither (directly) controls the domain \"trump-email.com,\" nor has access to the server. Instead, the domain was setup and controlled by Cendyn, a company that does marketing/promotions for hotels, including many of Trump＊s hotels. Cendyn outsources the email portions of its campaigns to a company called Listrak, which actually owns/operates the physical server in a data center in Philadelphia.§ \nSo the server wasn＊t even owned by the Trump Organization . And yet it took the FBI months, and ※journalists,§ including even The Intercept , ※weeks§ to conclude that this story is completely bogus. The US taxpayers should demand their money back 每 not to mention Pierre Omidyar . \nEven after this sloppy McCarthyite smear was debunked, the Clinton campaign breathlessly repeated the charges: ※This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump＊s ties to Russia§! What this perfervid fantasy is the actually key to is the hysterical desperation of the Clinton campaign as it is engulfed in daily scandals that threaten to sink it beneath the electoral waves. \nAre you laughing 每 or crying 每 yet? Oh, but I＊m not done! If you think this grade-B conspiracy theory is the lowest form of electoral entertainment, then you obviously haven＊t read David Corn＊s latest entry into the Smear Trump Sweepstakes. Glenn Greenwald 每 no friend of Trump＊s 每 describes it as ※an unnamed person, from an unknown country, who used to work in an unnamed agency, claims Trump is a Russian agent.§ How did the real estate mogul become a tool of the Kremlin? Well, you see, Trump once traveled to Russia, where he was suborned by one of those slinky-looking Russian ladies and ※Russian intelligence had ＆compromised＊ Trump during his visits to Moscow and could ＆blackmail him.＊§ \nYes, they＊re blackmailing Trump over a sexual indiscretion 每 because that would destroy him for sure ! And it＊s all in a ※secret memo§ that only Corn, the editors of Mother Jones , and their Mysterious Veteran Spook have seen. \nOn one level, this is hysterically funny; it＊s grade-C thriller material that is likely to be found at the bottom of some publisher＊s slush pile. On another level 每 the political level 每 it is immensely depressingly significant 每 because these people are ※liberals,§ even ※leftists.§ They aren＊t stupid: they know the ignominious history of witch-hunting in this country. I＊d call this McCarthyism 每 but even Joe McCarthy had some actual evidence to back up his claims of ※foreign agents§ lurking in the corridors of power. Corn, Foer, and the Clinton campaign are simply retailing lies. \nWhat＊s depressing about this is the fact that, if Hillary wins, it isn＊t going to stop. Far from it: the new ※red scare§ will accelerate, as her political enemies are tarred with the ※KGB agent§ brush. And when the notoriously vindictive Democratic candidate takes revenge not only on her domestic political enemies, but on the Russians, an ugly 每 and dangerous 每 confrontation is in the cards. She＊ll sic the FBI on Trump＊s supporters, and Trump himself, and she＊ll unleash the US military and our allies on Putin 每 and then, watch out. \nThat American liberalism has degenerated into a Russophobic, warmongering, witch-hunting ideology so quickly is one of the most astonishing ideological transformations in our political history. And all in the name of garnering partisan political advantage. As Donald Trump would put it: Sad! \nNOTES IN THE MARGIN \nYou can check out my Twitter feed by going here .

    "text": "Email \n\nBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. 〞 More than 100 of Hillary Clinton＊s biggest donors crowded into the home of Casey and Laura Wasserman here on Thursday night, each having written a check for at least $33,400 to snag a ticket. The Hollywood glitterati in attendance 〞 Elton John performed on the piano; Barbra Streisand mingled in the crowd 〞 were sending her off for the home stretch of the campaign with north of $5 million in fresh funding. \nIt was a fitting capstone to a remarkable 18 months for Clinton on the lucrative California fundraising circuit, this final event anchored by a host committee of billionaires, Hollywood executives, media moguls and tech investors 〞 Sean Parker, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Haim Saban, Chris Sacca 〞 that each directed $416,000 to Clinton＊s efforts. \nClinton calls them her ※Hillblazers,§ campaign bundlers who have given or raised at least $100,000 for her campaign. And she has erected an unparalleled and unprecedented infrastructure of 1,133 such people 〞 nearly double the number of any past presidential candidate, including President Obama four years ago. \nWhile Clinton and her advisers like to tout her small online donors, it is these bundlers in more than 40 states and four foreign countries who form the true backbone of her financial operation. Combined, this elite $100,000-and-up club has amassed a minimum of $113 million for Clinton and the Democratic Party 〞 and the actual figure is likely far, far higher than that. (The biggest bundlers typically collect millions for campaigns.) \n※We had the best base of donors and bundlers and raisers ever in 2008. It was even better in 2012. And it＊s much better in 2016 than 2012,§ said Wade Randlett, a San Francisco-based Democrat who has raised money for Clinton, Obama and Democratic causes for decades. ※The Obama people basically 100 percent in are favor of Hillary. There＊s really no loss because of ideology or bad blood. And she has added an enormous number of people, especially women.§ \nAmong her bundlers are celebrities (Will Smith) and sports stars (Earvin ※Magic§ Johnson), Hollywood directors (Steven Spielberg and George Lucas) and corporate executives (Marissa Mayer and Sheryl Sandberg), Wall Street-types (Marc Lasry), media executives (Haim Saban and Anna Wintour) and members of Congress, including her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, who helped raise more than $100,000 for Clinton before he joined the ticket in July. \nThe Clinton campaign said 45 percent of its bundlers are women. \nThere are also federal lobbyists, from whom the Democratic Party under Obama refused to accept money, a prohibition that has since been rolled back. \nThis club has expanded to the point where Clinton would now struggle to fit all of these bundlers into a single ballroom. As of the end of June, she counted 496 such individuals and couples. By the end of July, it was 871. On August 31, it was 1,133. \nIt includes billionaires George Soros, Warren Buffett and Tom Steyer, super lobbyists like Steve Elmendorf and bold-faced names like Calvin Klein and J.J. Abrams. There is also a sprinkling of longtime Clinton family advisers, such as Vernon Jordan.",

For us, this is a HUGE reason NOT TO VOTE FOR HILLARY! She got $50 million from this man. I guess you know what am I talking about. Do not let their cooperation continue, because it is going to end up bad for America. Lets choose a true patriot and see where would our country go! I am sure it is going to be much better than crooked Hillary＊s road. \nTurki al-Faisal, who served as Saudia Arabia＊s ambassador to the US from 2005 to 2007, spoke against the presumptive Republican nominee during a foreign policy dinner in Washington, DC on Thursday. \nHe blasted Trump＊s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, which the billionaire first formulated in December last year before renewing his vow on Wednesday. \n＆For the life of me, I cannot believe that a country like the United States can afford to have someone as president who simply says, ※These people are not going to be allowed to come to the United States,§＊ Turki said according to the Huffington Post. \n＆It＊s up to you, it＊s not up to me,＊ Turki added. ＆I just hope you, as American citizens, will make the right choice in November.＊ \nThe gulf nations represent three of the largest donors to the foundation, but that is hardly the extent of their ties to the Clintons.

One of Hillary＊s top advisers, Cheryl Mills, served on the board of the New York \nUniversity campus in Abu Dhabi. Bill Clinton is the friend and former classmate of Saudi Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, who recently attended a lavish Clinton Foundation conference in Marrakech, hosted by the King of Morocco. The Bill Clinton presidential library in Little Rock was funded in part by a $10 million from the Saudi Royal family. \nTurk, who went to Georgetown University in Washington, DC, isn＊t currently part of Saudia Arabia＊s government but serves as the chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, a cultural organization that conducts research in politics, sociology and heritage.",

    "text": "Email \n\nHillary Clinton declared during NBC News＊s Commander-in-Chief forum that no lives were lost in Libya when she made the move to take out dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Even so, the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that 11 months later four Americans 每 including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens 每 were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created. \n※That was one of the few situations in American foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we don＊t make the wrong move, and the operation was a success, even Donald Trump supported it,§ Clinton argued. ※As with any operation of such magnitude, we had a few hiccups, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. As I＊ve said, the operation was a success.§ \nShe continued, ※So much so, in fact, that I＊m proud to say that no important people were lost through it all, and when I say that, I say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that Libyans could be freed from the iron fist of Gaddafi. It would have been unrealistic to expect 0 casualties; however, the overall toll did not exceed expectations, with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy.§ \n※Politics can be a cruel line of work. That being said, I stand before you here, today, and I am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it. And while we＊re on the subject of sacrifices, thank God they did not include anyone important from the American delegation, including yours truly,§ she said jokingly, causing the auditorium to laugh. \nShe said, ※But all jokes aside, I have to pay homage to the CIA, who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day. Its agents＊ work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come. If it hadn＊t been for them, we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations. I am proud that the United States of America has an intelligence agency such as the CIA.§ \n※I＊m sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay, a bargain, if you will, when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist. I would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed Gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region. For better of worse, we acted and I am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the CIA out of a deal. Because, in the words of a personal friend of mine, who is a former CIA spook 每 shutting down arms dealers is easy; finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part,§ she concluded.",

    "text": "Email \n\nIt appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. Reports are circulating that the Clinton＊s have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. \nThis move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn＊t plan to allow her or Bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. \nThe country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. \nDonald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e-mail server to gun-running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. \nApparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration, John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million Nantucket mansion in June 2016 as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. \nPresident Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. \nSnopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama＊s purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams, however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has. \nThe Bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of 100,000 acres in Paraguay in 2006, yet another country good for the Bush family, since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime. If the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the Bush Administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on 9-11, the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request. Apparently, if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous, the Bush＊s plan on getting out of the country as well. \nInterestingly, the Bush family＊s Nazi connections dating back to WWII seem to have played a part in the Paraguay purchase since most Nazis fled to South America after WWII. Since George H. W. Bush＊s father Senator Prescott Bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the Nazis, the Bush family has a long history of being associated with Nazis. \nWith the movement of huge amounts of funds, selling millions of dollars in real estate, and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas, we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in Washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions, murdering US citizens in the thousands, and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since 9-11 finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed. \nWe are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a Nazi Dictatorship in Washington to an actual Presidential Administration who not only will look to the Constitution as the basis of all laws, but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people, for the people, and of the people of the USA. Not the Dictatorship over the people, to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power.",

    "text": "Email \n\nDemocratic Vice President Joe Biden wants American women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy. ※If we just put all the women back to work, if they were able to afford childcare, we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent,§ he said. ※That＊s trillions of dollars over the next decade.§ \nBiden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. ※The state of our economy could be characterized by a single word: pitiful,§ he argued. ※We＊re still battling recession, I don＊t care what the official stats are saying, America is still in recession. And we＊re not doing anything about it.§ \nHe added that it was ※lazy American women§ who brought about the downfall of the economy, because ※they sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them.§ ※I＊m not sure how exactly we got to this point, but we＊re here and we need to move. Like, yesterday,§ he said. \n※Mark my words and mark them well,§ he addressed the crowd. ※Hillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, she＊s a woman herself and not just any woman; she＊s a self-made woman. So you better believe what she＊s saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.§ \n※Second, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. She＊s been all that and she＊s learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add,§ Biden continued. \n※Today＊s women are pampered and aren＊t used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own,§ the vice president said. ※They＊re too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is they＊ve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.§ \n※Now, that＊s all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, it＊s the economy that＊s missing out on valuable workforce. And that＊s why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States. We need to heal this country, folks, not run it into the ground even deeper,§ Biden concluded.",

    "title": "WIKILEAKS: Hillary Got $12 Million for Clinton Charity As Quid Pro Quo For Morocco Meeting",
    "text": "Email \nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arranged a $12 million donation from Moroccan King Mohammed VI to her family＊s charity in 2014 in return for the Clinton Global Initiative hosting its international meeting in the North African Muslim nation, according to an email made public Thursday by Wikileaks. \nThe Moroccan monarch＊s funds went to the Clinton Foundation＊s endowment and to CGI. The Jan. 18, 2015, email was included in Wikileaks＊ latest batch of communications to and from Clinton＊s presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. \nThe email from Huma Abedin, Clinton＊s Deputy Chief of Staff at the State Department, was addressed to Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook. Hillary Clinton was a director of the foundation at the time. \nSingapore and Hong Kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the CGI meeting in their countries, but the North African nation ultimately hosted it in a five-star hotel in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2015. Abedin told Podesta and Mook that Morocco was not CGI＊s ※first choice.§ \nThe actual meeting was paid for by OCP, the Moroccan-government-owned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations. Clinton vigorously supported the Moroccan King when she was Secretary of State and the U.S.-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure as Secretary of State. \nThe mining company also contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to the charity＊s web site.Abedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss. Hillary Clinton ※created this mess and she knows it,§ she told Podesta and Mook.She said the Moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss. ※This was HRC＊s idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx. $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.§ HRC stands for Hillary Rodham Clinton. \nAbedin said Clinton＊s attendance at the CGI event was a condition of the $12 million contribution. ※Just to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter,§ Abedin said. \nPolitico in 2015 reported that Clinton ※was seen by Rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the Obama administration.§ Rabat is the capital of Morocco. \nThe Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with ※serious human rights violations,§ including exploitation of workers by not ※adequately compensating the impoverished people who live there.§ \nMohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the Polisaro Front, as reported by AL-Monitor, a Middle East news site in 2015 that ※OCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation 〞 it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years.§ \nPolisaro claims to lead a Moroccan government-in-exile based in Tindouf, Algeria. \n※They＊re doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara,§ Beisat charged. \nThe Moroccan firm mines phosphates. Human rights critics have called OCP＊s mining product ※blood phosphates,§ appropriating the term ※blood diamonds§ for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers \nOCP is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the Clinton Foundation. The foundation accepted a $100 million pledge from Lukas Lundin, who owns mining and oil drilling operations in North Africa and in the Congo. (RELATED: Clinton Foundation Got $100M From ＆Blood Minerals＊ Firm) \nOCP retained the law firm of Covington & Burling, one of Washington＊s lobbying giants, paying the firm $1.4 million in fees from 2012 to 2015. \nStuart Eizenstat, a former White House domestic policy chief under President Carter and an influential Democratic Party insider, was the main lobbyist for the mining firm. He was also President Bill Clinton＊s ambassador to the European Union, a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Under Secretary at the Department of Commerce. \nEizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at Commerce where he worked in the International Trade Administration. \nHillary Clinton officially visited Morocco twice, in November 2009 and in February 2012, meeting with the King on both occasions. The two also met in New York in December 2013 where it was believed the two discussed Morocco＊s bid to host the CGI meeting and the King＊s $12 million donation. \nThe Moroccan World News described the meeting as showing ※renewed friendship between the royal family and the Clinton family, as well as Hillary Clinton＊s esteem for Morocco and its people.§ \nAbedin warned both campaign executives that if CGI decided to renege on the agreement, it would hurt Clinton＊s relationship with the King. ※It will break a lot of china to back out now,§ she wrote. \nUltimately, Clinton did not attend the meeting because it was close to the launch of her presidential campaign, but the former president and daughter Chelsea were present and during the conference were guests at one of the Moroccan King＊s palaces.",

Reports are circulating that the Clinton＊s have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. \nThis move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn＊t plan to allow her or Bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. \nThe country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. \nDonald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e-mail server to gun-running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. \nApparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration, John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million Nantucket mansion in June 2016 as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. \nPresident Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. \nSnopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama＊s purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams, however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has. \nThe Bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of 100,000 acres in Paraguay in 2006, yet another country good for the Bush family, since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime. If the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the Bush Administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on 9-11, the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request. Apparently, if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous, the Bush＊s plan on getting out of the country as well. \nInterestingly, the Bush family＊s Nazi connections dating back to WWII seem to have played a part in the Paraguay purchase since most Nazis fled to South America after WWII. Since George H. W. Bush＊s father Senator Prescott Bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the Nazis, the Bush family has a long history of being associated with Nazis. \nWith the movement of huge amounts of funds, selling millions of dollars in real estate, and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas, we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in Washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions, murdering US citizens in the thousands, and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since 9-11 finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed. \nWe are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a Nazi Dictatorship in Washington to an actual Presidential Administration who not only will look to the Constitution as the basis of all laws, but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people, for the people, and of the people of the USA. Not the Dictatorship over the people, to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power.",

    "title": "Biden Blames ※Lazy American Women§ For The Economy: ※They Sit Around Doing Nothing, Only Hillary Can Force Them To Work§",
    "text": "Email \n\nDemocratic Vice President Joe Biden wants American women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy. ※If we just put all the women back to work, if they were able to afford childcare, we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent,§ he said. ※That＊s trillions of dollars over the next decade.§ \nBiden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. ※The state of our economy could be characterized by a single word: pitiful,§ he argued. ※We＊re still battling recession, I don＊t care what the official stats are saying, America is still in recession. And we＊re not doing anything about it.§ \nHe added that it was ※lazy American women§ who brought about the downfall of the economy, because ※they sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them.§ ※I＊m not sure how exactly we got to this point, but we＊re here and we need to move. Like, yesterday,§ he said. \n※Mark my words and mark them well,§ he addressed the crowd. ※Hillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, she＊s a woman herself and not just any woman; she＊s a self-made woman. So you better believe what she＊s saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.§ \n※Second, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. She＊s been all that and she＊s learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add,§ Biden continued. \n※Today＊s women are pampered and aren＊t used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own,§ the vice president said. ※They＊re too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is they＊ve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.§ \n※Now, that＊s all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, it＊s the economy that＊s missing out on valuable workforce. And that＊s why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States. We need to heal this country, folks, not run it into the ground even deeper,§ Biden concluded.",

    "title": "WIKILEAKS: Hillary Got $12 Million for Clinton Charity As Quid Pro Quo For Morocco Meeting",
    "text": "Email \nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arranged a $12 million donation from Moroccan King Mohammed VI to her family＊s charity in 2014 in return for the Clinton Global Initiative hosting its international meeting in the North African Muslim nation, according to an email made public Thursday by Wikileaks. \nThe Moroccan monarch＊s funds went to the Clinton Foundation＊s endowment and to CGI. The Jan. 18, 2015, email was included in Wikileaks＊ latest batch of communications to and from Clinton＊s presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. \nThe email from Huma Abedin, Clinton＊s Deputy Chief of Staff at the State Department, was addressed to Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook. Hillary Clinton was a director of the foundation at the time. \nSingapore and Hong Kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the CGI meeting in their countries, but the North African nation ultimately hosted it in a five-star hotel in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2015. Abedin told Podesta and Mook that Morocco was not CGI＊s ※first choice.§ \nThe actual meeting was paid for by OCP, the Moroccan-government-owned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations. Clinton vigorously supported the Moroccan King when she was Secretary of State and the U.S.-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure as Secretary of State. \nThe mining company also contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to the charity＊s web site.Abedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss. Hillary Clinton ※created this mess and she knows it,§ she told Podesta and Mook.She said the Moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss. ※This was HRC＊s idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx. $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.§ HRC stands for Hillary Rodham Clinton. \nAbedin said Clinton＊s attendance at the CGI event was a condition of the $12 million contribution. ※Just to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter,§ Abedin said. \nPolitico in 2015 reported that Clinton ※was seen by Rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the Obama administration.§ Rabat is the capital of Morocco. \nThe Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with ※serious human rights violations,§ including exploitation of workers by not ※adequately compensating the impoverished people who live there.§ \nMohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the Polisaro Front, as reported by AL-Monitor, a Middle East news site in 2015 that ※OCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation 〞 it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years.§ \nPolisaro claims to lead a Moroccan government-in-exile based in Tindouf, Algeria. \n※They＊re doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara,§ Beisat charged. \nThe Moroccan firm mines phosphates. Human rights critics have called OCP＊s mining product ※blood phosphates,§ appropriating the term ※blood diamonds§ for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers \nOCP is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the Clinton Foundation. The foundation accepted a $100 million pledge from Lukas Lundin, who owns mining and oil drilling operations in North Africa and in the Congo. (RELATED: Clinton Foundation Got $100M From ＆Blood Minerals＊ Firm) \nOCP retained the law firm of Covington & Burling, one of Washington＊s lobbying giants, paying the firm $1.4 million in fees from 2012 to 2015. \nStuart Eizenstat, a former White House domestic policy chief under President Carter and an influential Democratic Party insider, was the main lobbyist for the mining firm. He was also President Bill Clinton＊s ambassador to the European Union, a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Under Secretary at the Department of Commerce. \nEizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at Commerce where he worked in the International Trade Administration. \nHillary Clinton officially visited Morocco twice, in November 2009 and in February 2012, meeting with the King on both occasions. The two also met in New York in December 2013 where it was believed the two discussed Morocco＊s bid to host the CGI meeting and the King＊s $12 million donation. \nThe Moroccan World News described the meeting as showing ※renewed friendship between the royal family and the Clinton family, as well as Hillary Clinton＊s esteem for Morocco and its people.§ \nAbedin warned both campaign executives that if CGI decided to renege on the agreement, it would hurt Clinton＊s relationship with the King. ※It will break a lot of china to back out now,§ she wrote. \nUltimately, Clinton did not attend the meeting because it was close to the launch of her presidential campaign, but the former president and daughter Chelsea were present and during the conference were guests at one of the Moroccan King＊s palaces.",

    "text": "Email \nDonald Trump＊s campaign debuted a dark new attack ad on Tuesday, looking to further its portrayal of Hillary Clinton as a corrupt politician and doubling down on allegations that she grew wealthy through ※pay-to-play politics.§The TV spot hits Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, on controversies related to her family＊s foundation, stating that ※staggering amounts of cash poured into the Clinton Foundation from criminals, dictators, countries that hate America§ and that ※Hillary cut deals for donors.§ \nClinton＊s charitable foundation has faced intense scrutiny this election over concerns about possible conflicts of interest because it took in money from corporations and foreign governments. Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation＊s work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton ※sold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.§※Hillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,§ its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and high-profile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husband＊s character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen. John McCain, Trump has promised to plow forward, and some observers suggest he has little to lose.※It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,§ he tweeted on Tuesday.",

    "text": "Email \nThe second presidential debate flew off the rails on Sunday night when Donald Trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against Bill Clinton and suggested that Hillary Clinton could \"be in jail\" if he's elected in November, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server. \n\nABC's Martha Raddatz, one of the debate moderators, asked Trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking 2005 video released Friday, in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission, was consistent with his current behavior. \n\"As I told you, that was locker-room talk,\" Trump said. \"I am not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for people of this country, and I'm not proud of it.\" \nTrump then said if you \"look at the history of politics in this country, no one had been so abusive of women\" as former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the Democratic nominee, whom Trump suggested intimidated those women. \nThree women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with Trump earlier Sunday, and each was seated in the front row at the debate. \n\"Mine were words 〞 his were actions,\" Trump said. \n\"So, don't tell me about words,\" he continued. \"I am absolutely, I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. Bill Clinton. He was impeached. He was no longer allowed to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who is here tonight.

And I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.\" \nDonald Trump: \"If I win, I'm going to instruct my attorney general\" to investigate Clinton https://t.co/raPU4ICkl6 https://t.co/IWGVUleEtr \n〞 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 10, 2016The former secretary of state responded by saying that \"so much of what he just said is not right\" but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign. \n\"I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all,\" she said. \"When they go low, you go high.\" \n\"And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable,\" she said. \"But everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes to anyone for anything.\" \nShe mentioned that Trump had not apologized to the Khans, a couple who lost a son, a Muslim US soldier, during the Iraq War. Trump engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Khans after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention in July. \nClinton also said Trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera, a federal judge who Trump said couldn't do his job fairly because he was of Mexican descent, and President Barack Obama, whose birthplace Trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign. \n\"He owes the president an apology, he needs to apologize to our country, and he needs to take responsibility,\" she said. \nTrump responded by repeating the false claim that the Clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on Obama's birthplace in 2008. He added that she owed an apology for the \"33,000 emails you deleted.\" \n\"If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,\" Trump said. \"Because there have never been so many lies, so much deception. And we're going to have a special prosecutor.\" \nClinton said everything Trump said was \"absolutely false\" but she was \"not surprised.\" \n\"Oh really?\" Trump interjected. \nClinton then mentioned the difficulty in fact-checking Trump, to which he capped off the exchange by saying \"you'd be in jail\" during his potential administration.",

He founded ISIS,§ the real estate tycoon said, using an alternative acronym for the terrorist group. ※I would say the co-founder would be ＆Crooked＊ Hillary Clinton,§ Trump added. He went on to criticize Obama＊s decision to withdraw American military forces from Iraq and leaving behind a void for Daesh terrorists to fill. ※We should never have gotten out the way we got out,§ he said. ※We unleashed terrible fury all over the Middle East.\" ※Instead of allowing some small forces behind to maybe, just maybe, keep it under control, we pulled it out,§ he continued. Daesh terrorists, many of whom were initially trained by the CIA in Jordan in 2012 to destabilize the Syrian government, still control parts of Iraq and Syria. They have been engaged in crimes against humanity in areas under their control. They have been carrying out horrific acts of violence such as public decapitations and crucifixions against all communities, including Shia and Sunni Muslims, Kurds, and Christians. In a statement last week, Mike Pence, Trump＊s vice presidential candidate, also said that the policies of Obama and Clinton led to the rise of Daesh. He blamed Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the ※disastrous decisions§ that led to the death of Captain Humayun Khan in Iraq. On July 28, Captain Khan＊s father, Khizr Khan, addressed the Democratic National Convention, denouncing Trump as unpatriotic and selfish over his statements against immigrants and Muslims.",

    "text": "Email US President Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton ※founded§ the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group in the Middle East region, according to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Addressing supporters at a rally in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump said Daesh is \"honoring President Obama.\" ※He＊s the founder of ISIS. He's the founder! He founded ISIS,§ the real estate tycoon said, using an alternative acronym for the terrorist group. ※I would say the co-founder would be ＆Crooked＊ Hillary Clinton,§ Trump added. He went on to criticize Obama＊s decision to withdraw American military forces from Iraq and leaving behind a void for Daesh terrorists to fill. ※We should never have gotten out the way we got out,§ he said. ※We unleashed terrible fury all over the Middle East.\" ※Instead of allowing some small forces behind to maybe, just maybe, keep it under control, we pulled it out,§ he continued. Daesh terrorists, many of whom were initially trained by the CIA in Jordan in 2012 to destabilize the Syrian government, still control parts of Iraq and Syria. They have been engaged in crimes against humanity in areas under their control. They have been carrying out horrific acts of violence such as public decapitations and crucifixions against all communities, including Shia and Sunni Muslims, Kurds, and Christians. In a statement last week, Mike Pence, Trump＊s vice presidential candidate, also said that the policies of Obama and Clinton led to the rise of Daesh. He blamed Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the ※disastrous decisions§ that led to the death of Captain Humayun Khan in Iraq. On July 28, Captain Khan＊s father, Khizr Khan, addressed the Democratic National Convention, denouncing Trump as unpatriotic and selfish over his statements against immigrants and Muslims.",

    "text": "Email \nDonald Trump＊s campaign debuted a dark new attack ad on Tuesday, looking to further its portrayal of Hillary Clinton as a corrupt politician and doubling down on allegations that she grew wealthy through ※pay-to-play politics.§The TV spot hits Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, on controversies related to her family＊s foundation, stating that ※staggering amounts of cash poured into the Clinton Foundation from criminals, dictators, countries that hate America§ and that ※Hillary cut deals for donors.§ \nClinton＊s charitable foundation has faced intense scrutiny this election over concerns about possible conflicts of interest because it took in money from corporations and foreign governments. Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation＊s work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton ※sold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.§※Hillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,§ its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and high-profile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husband＊s character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen. John McCain, Trump has promised to plow forward, and some observers suggest he has little to lose.※It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,§ he tweeted on Tuesday.",

    "text": "Email \nThe second presidential debate flew off the rails on Sunday night when Donald Trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against Bill Clinton and suggested that Hillary Clinton could \"be in jail\" if he's elected in November, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server. \n\nABC's Martha Raddatz, one of the debate moderators, asked Trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking 2005 video released Friday, in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission, was consistent with his current behavior. \n\"As I told you, that was locker-room talk,\" Trump said. \"I am not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for people of this country, and I'm not proud of it.\" \nTrump then said if you \"look at the history of politics in this country, no one had been so abusive of women\" as former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the Democratic nominee, whom Trump suggested intimidated those women. \nThree women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with Trump earlier Sunday, and each was seated in the front row at the debate. \n\"Mine were words 〞 his were actions,\" Trump said. \n\"So, don't tell me about words,\" he continued. \"I am absolutely, I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. Bill Clinton. He was impeached. He was no longer allowed to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who is here tonight. That when Hillary brings up a point like that, brings up words I say 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful. And I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.\" \nDonald Trump: \"If I win, I'm going to instruct my attorney general\" to investigate Clinton https://t.co/raPU4ICkl6 https://t.co/IWGVUleEtr \n〞 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 10, 2016The former secretary of state responded by saying that \"so much of what he just said is not right\" but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign. \n\"I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all,\" she said. \"When they go low, you go high.\" \n\"And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable,\" she said. \"But everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes to anyone for anything.\" \nShe mentioned that Trump had not apologized to the Khans, a couple who lost a son, a Muslim US soldier, during the Iraq War. Trump engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Khans after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention in July. \nClinton also said Trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera, a federal judge who Trump said couldn't do his job fairly because he was of Mexican descent, and President Barack Obama, whose birthplace Trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign. \n\"He owes the president an apology, he needs to apologize to our country, and he needs to take responsibility,\" she said. \nTrump responded by repeating the false claim that the Clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on Obama's birthplace in 2008. He added that she owed an apology for the \"33,000 emails you deleted.\" \n\"If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,\" Trump said. \"Because there have never been so many lies, so much deception. And we're going to have a special prosecutor.\" \nClinton said everything Trump said was \"absolutely false\" but she was \"not surprised.\" \n\"Oh really?\" Trump interjected. \nClinton then mentioned the difficulty in fact-checking Trump, to which he capped off the exchange by saying \"you'd be in jail\" during his potential administration.",

    "text": "Email \n\nHillary Clinton declared during NBC News＊s Commander-in-Chief forum that no lives were lost in Libya when she made the move to take out dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Even so, the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that 11 months later four Americans 每 including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens 每 were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created. \n※That was one of the few situations in American foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we don＊t make the wrong move, and the operation was a success, even Donald Trump supported it,§ Clinton argued. ※As with any operation of such magnitude, we had a few hiccups, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. As I＊ve said, the operation was a success.§ \nShe continued, ※So much so, in fact, that I＊m proud to say that no important people were lost through it all, and when I say that, I say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that Libyans could be freed from the iron fist of Gaddafi. It would have been unrealistic to expect 0 casualties; however, the overall toll did not exceed expectations, with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy.§ \n※Politics can be a cruel line of work. That being said, I stand before you here, today, and I am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it. And while we＊re on the subject of sacrifices, thank God they did not include anyone important from the American delegation, including yours truly,§ she said jokingly, causing the auditorium to laugh. \nShe said, ※But all jokes aside, I have to pay homage to the CIA, who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day. Its agents＊ work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come. If it hadn＊t been for them, we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations. I am proud that the United States of America has an intelligence agency such as the CIA.§ \n※I＊m sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay, a bargain, if you will, when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist. I would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed Gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region. For better of worse, we acted and I am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the CIA out of a deal. Because, in the words of a personal friend of mine, who is a former CIA spook 每 shutting down arms dealers is easy; finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part,§ she concluded.",

According to an exclusive interview given to Mail Online, Dolly Kyle was behind the scene＊s long enough to not only know the two＊s darkest secrets but even their dirty sexual habits 每 and now, she＊s telling everyone. \nThe connection between Dolly and Bill began when she was just 11-years-old.

He wanted to put to bed the rumors that Hillary was a lesbian, even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true. \nDolly states that the worst came when she met Hillary for the first time. ※In that moment I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering [body] odor of perspiration and greasy hair.

This FBI that is lying and trying to change documentation should be held to a legal standard and people who have tried to hide documentation and have lied should be thrown in prison for treason! \nAs far as how the media treats Hillary Clinton, if you＊ve noticed, they treat her like a queen. The liberal media likes to pamper, lie, and make sure America knows she is the best option. We, however, know better. So does Jason Chaffetz. \nFor those of you who do it know who Chaffetz is, he is the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman who famously told the guy who destroyed Hillary＊s email server that he was served on live TV. Now he just served up a brutal threat to Hillary Clinton and she is running scared. \nHOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM CHAIRMAN JASON CHAFFETZ CONFIRMED IT WILL HOLD ADDITIONAL HEARINGS ON DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HILLARY CLINTON＊S PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER WHEN MEMBERS RETURN FROM RECESS. \nNEW FBI DOCUMENTS RELEASED MONDAY SHOW UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE PATRICK KENNEDY PUSHING THE FBI TO DECLASSIFY EMAILS IN EXCHANGE FOR A ※QUID PRO QUO§ DEAL 〞 A MOVE CHAFFETZ AND HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES FOUND DEEPLY TROUBLING. \n※Undoubtedly there will be, based on the documents the FBI released today there are new facts that need to be investigated. I＊m very concerned about the quid pro quo that was in negotiation between the State Department and the FBI,§ Chaffetz told The Daily Caller News Foundation. ※Chairman Nunes and I believe Patrick Kennedy should be relieved of his duties immediately pending an investigation. This is a manipulation if not an outright crime and so we＊re gonna drive into that.§ \nWhile the downgrade discussed between the agency officials didn＊t come into fruition, the congressmen were clear they believe the proposal was inappropriate.",

Let＊s just hope all of America wakes up to this reality before it＊s too late and she can do any more damage than she already has. \nBill and Hillary Clinton just can＊t stay out of the spotlight these days, and the most recent leak about them could be the most damaging yet. As it turns out, someone once close to the duo just came forward to share Bill＊s revealing nickname for his wife 〞 but the worse comes as their dirty bedroom habits were exposed. \nIt＊s no mystery that Bill Clinton is a sexual deviant, but the most recent account given by the woman who had a 3-decade affair with the man is damning, to say the least. According to an exclusive interview given to Mail Online, Dolly Kyle was behind the scene＊s long enough to not only know the two＊s darkest secrets but even their dirty sexual habits 每 and now, she＊s telling everyone. \nThe connection between Dolly and Bill began when she was just 11-years-old. He was about 13-years-old at the time, but Dolly states that there was an immediate attraction, even then. As the years progressed, the two became romantically involved and stayed that way through several of their marriages over the next 30 years. \nThe real affair began in 1974 just after Dolly divorced her first husband, and although Bill wasn＊t married yet, he would be within the year. Although she was never interested in sharing the intimate details of the relationship, she states that she snapped when she heard Hillary recently say that all sexual assault victims have the ※right to be believed.§ \nKnowing full well just what Hillary had done 每 between the threats and the lies 每 to the many women who either had an affair with or were sexually assaulted by her husband Bill, Dolly knew she had to do something about it. Unfortunately for Hillary, Dolly is now coming forward with the dirty 2-word nickname Bill husband once called Hillary, among other things. \nAccording to Mail Online, Bill approached Dolly at their high school＊s 35-year reunion to talk about ※ the warden§ 每 a.k.a. Hillary. Saying he was unhappy with his life and marriage, this was the least significant account Dolly had to share. \nIn fact, Dolly recalls that Bill mentioned something about having a baby to her. Although she thought he was saying he wanted to have one with her, he was actually talking about Hillary. He wanted to put to bed the rumors that Hillary was a lesbian, even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true. \nDolly states that the worst came when she met Hillary for the first time. ※In that moment I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering [body] odor of perspiration and greasy hair. I hoped that I wouldn＊t gag when she got in my car,§ she said. ※The sandal-shod woman with lank, smelly hair stood off to the side and glared at everyone.§ \nNo wonder Bill went elsewhere to fulfill his ※sexual addiction,§ as Dolly referred to it.

    "text": "HILLARY＊S (Islamic) AMERICA IS ALREADY HERE where ＆Muslim NO-GO ZONES＊ are popping up all over Michiganistan The rest of America may be agonizing over the security implications of taking in potential Islamic jihadists posing as refugees. But Syrian Muslim invaders are being welcomed with open arms in Hamtramck, Michigan 每 America＊s first and only majority Muslim city. Non-Muslim residents in the Dearborn area are saying ＆You know, we＊re getting ready to sell and get out of here.＊§ (Before property values tank as a result of the Muslim invasion with a mosque on every corner, blasting amplified Islamic Calls to Prayer several times a day) WND ( h/t Liz) Once 90 percent Polish Catholic, the blue-collar enclave just outside Detroit has been transformed by successive waves of immigrants from Bangladesh, Yemen and Bosnia. Muslims now outnumber non-Muslims, the council has a Muslim majority and the call to prayer echoes through the streets five times a day. ※They＊re setting this all up so they can continue their ancient squabbles that they have carried on for centuries in the Middle East right here your neighborhood,§ Corcoran said. They call it ※culture shift.§ Places, in America, that no longer look or feel like America. (In Europe, they are referred to as NO-GO Zones) Cedar Riverside in Minneapolis fits the bill, with its large Somali community known as ※Little Mogadishu,§ as does and Hamtramck, Michigan, where the Islamic call to prayer is shouted over loudspeakers and the local city council is now majority-Muslim . Parts of Amarillo, Texas, have been flooded with so many Muslim refugees that some ethnic enclaves claim to have elected their own tribal leaders independent of the city government, the city＊s mayor recently testified before the Texas Legislature . Then there is Dearborn, Michigan, which is now 40 percent Muslim and spilling over into neighboring cities and towns. Documentary filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch recently drove through Dearborn, guided by a lifelong resident of the city named Brian (see video below). What Brian showed him was not just a culture shift but something closer to a shock. Women walk the streets dressed in long, black burqas that cover all but their eyes. Almost all the signs on storefronts are in Arabic or some other Middle Eastern dialect. Arab businessmen buy up commercial properties, force out the American tenants and replace them with similar businesses run by Muslims, Brian told Lynch in the documentary. The same phenomenon is now beginning to occur in nearby Sterling Heights, Troy, Oak Park and Clinton Township. In Sterling Heights, residents informed WND this week that Middle Eastern refugees are being housed in a local hotel owned by an Arab-American businessman. But in Dearborn, the tremendous growth in the Muslim community started more than 20 years ago, fueled by local universities and industry. Muslims voting for Muslims only ※Brian still lives there. He＊s not going anywhere,§ Lynch told WND in an interview. ※It depends on where you go in the city, but certain segments are 100 percent Muslim. Brian said to be prepared. We went through the areas, went shopping at the food mart. You really don＊t feel like you are in America anymore.§ Lynch said he was a regular contributor on Fox News between 2012 and 2015, until he started making hard-hitting documentaries on the U.S. immigration system. In certain areas in Dearborn. ※You have two areas, and it＊s almost like the Ford plants separate the two sides, and when you cross to the other side it＊s totally radical again. We went to a park where kids were playing after school with the mothers all there, and everybody was dressed in full burqa. It was almost like it was Halloween. I＊d never seen anything like it in my life.§ Dearborn does not exist on an island. Residents of southeastern Michigan have every reason to expect their towns will one day look like Dearborn, Lynch said, thanks to President Obama＊s Syrian refugee resettlement program, which Hillary Clinton says she＊d like to expand by more than 500 percent. This is ※Hillary＊s America,§ says a resident of nearby Rochester Hills who is one of the co-founders of SecureMichigan.org , a group that started up last year with the mission of helping educate Michiganders about Shariah law and Islamic settlements. He said the Islamization is literally moving from town to town in Oakland, Macomb and Wayne counties. ※The Sterling Heights story is significant because we have these budding ＆Shariahvilles＊ in Michigan,§ he said. ※We know there are refugees being planted. Now, in Rochester Hills, I＊ve got five covered women walking down my street, and that＊s never happened until two weeks ago.§ In one 18-day period from Oct. 1 through Oct. 18, the U.S. State Department and its federal contractors have sent 199 Syrians to three counties in southeast Michigan 每 Oakland, Macomb and Wayne 每and Oakland County leaders have not received any advance notice of the arrivals, said sources familiar with the growing controversy. The government contractors secretly planting the refugees in southeast Michigan are Lutheran Services/Samaritas, Catholic Charities of Southeast Michigan, USRI and Episcopal Migration Services. In Dearborn, the tremendous growth in the Muslim community started more than 20 years ago, fueled by local universities and industry. ※Brian still lives there. He＊s not going anywhere,§ Lynch told WND in an interview. ※It depends on where you go in the city, but certain segments are 100 percent Muslim. Brian said to be prepared. We went through the areas, went shopping at the food mart. You really Dearborn is but a harbinger of things to come for many more cities and towns across America if Hillary Clinton is elected president of the United States. ※I think if she gets elected you＊re going to see more immigration from Mideast countries than under any of the previous presidents including Obama, because she obviously has ties to those countries, getting an incredible amount of money donated from them,§ Lynch said. ※These donations come with strings. They come with side deals, and we don＊t know what they are. It may be something as simple as ＆OK, we want to see more immigration from our country or some other country into the United States.＊ Why else is there any need to increase the Syrian refugee settlements in America? There＊s no reason. ※If you look at all at the pay-for-play things, Muslims have said they want to spread Islam across the globe. The one country that doesn＊t have that much of it is the United States.§ Member of first Muslim-majority City Council warns: ※Today we show the Polish§＃thatMuslims are in charge. Within moments of winning the city＊s election, an organizer involved in the government takeover was caught making ominous threats against non-Muslims in the city. HillaryDaily T his warning is no doubt troubling in its own right, but becomes even more unsettling when one pairs the comment with recent polling that suggests what Muslims would do should they take over any facet of government. Over half reject the first amendment, while 46% want blasphemers punished. 12% percent would even like to see those who commit blasphemy killed outright. Given their comments about the white population in the area, coupled with the sobering statistics outlined in the recent poll, it looks as if the city of Hamtramck, Michigan may be faced with a extremist city council under which they must be governed.",

    "text": "BNI Store Nov 2 2016 BREAKING BOMBSHELL: NYPD blows whistle on new Hillary emails: Money Laundering, Pay to Play, Perjury, Sex Crimes with Children, Child Exploitation New York Police Department (NYPD) detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly-found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence ※to put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life,§ NYPD sources said. TruePundit NYPD sources said Clinton＊s ※crew§ also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders. The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday. But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to: Money laundering Sex crimes with minors (children) Perjury Pay to play through Clinton Foundation Obstruction of justice Other felony crimes NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department＊s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices. ※What＊s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,§ the NYPD Chief said. ※There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.§ The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton. ※People are going to prison,§ he said. Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said. ※If they don＊t cooperate they are going to see long sentences,§ a federal law enforcement source said. The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein＊s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries. Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein＊s guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.

Crime＊s are largely committed upon non believers, as is the right these people have been bought up to believe they have. They are bought up to lie and cheat. It is human nature for pretty much everyone 每 is to have material things better than they would normally afford. Be it a nicer home, or some annual holiday or expensive motor car. Who does not like the better things in life? Well 每 these scheming thieves already have a network of bribed politicians, EU, law officials, high paid company executives etc 每 in their pockets. All from a share of the corrupt money they have stolen from Western Societies. And distributed a cut to money greedy people who are trusted in running our companies, States and Countries. With what I see going on with the likes of the EU 每 I am not surprised one bit with likely outcomes with the Clinton foundation. Oh 每 they come out with statements that they are fighting terrorism, yet they have been bribed to do as they are told 每 and actually let these undesirables help themselves to our money. And these undesirables funnel plenty of money to the very people our in power politicians pretend they are protecting us from. It is very much a catch 22 situation. They spend lots of money to fight ISIS, yet on the hand allow these people to help themselves to our purse 每 effectively supporting them. All due to our human nature of wanting more than our honest fair share. Our financial world is can of worms. Let＊s hope a nasty world war is held off for as long as possible 每 as this is where we are heading 每 for whoever ends up in power. In the mean time 每 our people in power are turning our free Western societies into mini mayhems 每 and pretending they are doing good. All for MONEY.",

    "title": "Voting Machines Switching Trump Votes to Hillary Clinton: It Is Happening Again! | Crime All-Stars",
    "text": "(Before It's News)\nBy Michael Synder Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote.\nMost Americans don＊t realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney＊s chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state.\nUnfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a Quote: from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times ＃\n※I don＊t know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,§ said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens.\nStevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney .\n※I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney＊s name,§ Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House.\nShe said that the first time she pushed ※Romney,§ the machine marked ※Obama.§\nSo she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time.\n※Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,§ she told Fox News.\nAnd we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago.\nFor example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012.\nIf that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren＊t even worth mentioning.\nAnd of course this didn＊t just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country .\nThe reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again.\nIn Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper ＃\nShortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes ※switched.§ The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday.\nAnd Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas ＃\nGary and I went to early vote today＃I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn＊t get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don＊t hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed.\nI don＊t know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that.\nA similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas ＃\nHey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone＊s vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!\nAnd of course they weren＊t the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon ＃\nSo is there a serious problem with the voting machines?\nAccording to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots＃\nChambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters .\nChambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a ※software update§ on ES&S machines that otherwise ※omit one race§ when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch.\nLet＊s keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump＊s column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done.\nBut if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else.\nDespite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are ※ no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate ※＃\nIn 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country:\nNearly 2 million deceased registered to vote\nClose to 3 million registered in multiples states\nApproximately 24 million〞one of every eight〞voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate\nMore than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters\nApproximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state\nBut despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled ※ Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead ※＃\nAlmost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.\nAmericans overall are more confident that the nation＊s votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner.\nUnfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media.\nAnd the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up ＃\nU.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia＊s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud.\nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election.\nBut hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said.\nNow that is a real ※conspiracy theory§, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn＊t so serious.\nDuring this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it.\nThe American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us.\nAnd let＊s watch the state of Texas very carefully.

It is particularly noticeable at 6:10.\nDoes the following make me a racist?\nIf you'd like to know what Hillary is talking about in the second video you'll have to be able to speak Spanish since the translator speaks over Hillary.

This is just more confirmation of what I have already covered. \nThe above is already appearing on the Internet in several places. It is clear that Putin would be a fool to allow Clinton and her gang of thugs to continue with their plan. Every time Clinton sags in the polls, she starts talking about 9/11. The evidence is beginning to line up that Clinton interests had motive to commit 9/11. No wonder Clinton tries to blame the Russians for everything, she is the main culprit on the world being brought to the precipice of World War III. \nIt is a gratifying feeling when the dots start to connect. \nThe Aaron Klein Revelations \nAaron Klein, the Breitbart Bureau Chief for Jerusalem revealed, in a B reitbart publication dated March 1, 2016, revealed that ※the email from April 10th, 2011, the State Department employee, Timmy Davis, forwarded an email to the server by Clinton＊s aide, Huma Abedin .§ Please note that the time of this revelation, Huma Abedin, was not yet a household name. VIDEO: Pizza Hut Employees Caught On Tape Taking Celebratory BONG HITS AT WORK! \nThe series of emails will eventually have catastrophic consequences for Ambassador Stevens. ※An email containing the whereabouts and plans of murdered U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens passed through Hillary Clinton＊s private server, dispatches released Monday in the final group of messages from Clinton＊s emails reveal.§ \nBelow are some examples of the allegations posed by Klein and these are not empty charges as Klein offered as proof, the following emails . \n※A March 27, 2011 email released last year was titled, ※Chris Stevens mission.§ It divulged: ※The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage offshore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days. \nAn April 8, 2011 email was forwarded to Clinton revealing the ※security situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as required.§ \nAn April 22, 2011 email revealed Stevens was on the road: ※I want to let you know about a temporary rotation in Benghazi. TNC Envoy Chris Stevens has been on the road since March 13, when he began his outreach mission, and has been in Benghazi since April 5.§ CONVICTED KILLER RELEASED FROM JAIL BY MISTAKE \nAn April 24, 2011 email has the exact time of a Stevens meeting: ※§Stevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving into a villa, but that is some way off.§ \nIf later emails are released, I have no doubt, that we will see that Clinton was transmitting Stevens location up until the time of the attack upon the Benghazi compound and this explains why some of these emails are not being released. However, at some point, they will see the light of day. \nThe release of travel information, in any form, is a felony! Remember, the Stevens travel plans are classified and they came from Clinton＊s private server. A casual Law and Order fan could make the causal connections between the release of these emails and Stevens death. This is absolute evidence that Clinton not only is guilty of multiple felonies, she is an accomplice to murder!",

    "title": "Hillary＊s ※Big Tent§ is Obama＊s ※Grand Bargain§ on Steroids",
    "text": "2016 presidential campaign by BAR executive editor Glen Ford \nBarack Obama tried to woo Republicans into a ※Grand Bargain§ that would have gutted Social Security. Bill Clinton let loose the banks. But Donald Trump＊s destruction of the Republican Party will allow Hillary Clinton to ※gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle.§ The rich are about to get their best deal yet. Hillary＊s ※Big Tent§ is Obama＊s ※Grand Bargain§ on Steroids by BAR executive editor Glen Ford \n※ The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class.§ \nWhen Donald Trump took a wrecking ball to the Republican Party he provided the unexpected catalyst for completion of the corporate project begun by Bill Clinton, Al Gore and other white Democrats in the 1980s, with the founding of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). To counter relentless attrition of whites to the GOP in their home states, these beleaguered, mostly southern Democrats sought national corporate funding to turn their party decisively to the right. They reckoned, correctly, that a steady stream of corporate capital would allow them to control the new wave of Black voters and politicians that had been mobilized by Rev. Jesse Jackson＊s two presidential campaigns, while strengthening the hand of the South in national Democratic Party calculations. \nBill Clinton became the first DLC president in 1992, and moved swiftly and methodically to narrow the ideological differences between the duopoly parties. He completed much of Ronald Reagan＊s agenda, claiming it as his own; destroyed welfare ※as we knew it§; vastly expanded the mass Black Incarceration regime; pushed NAFTA through Congress over the objections of majorities in his own party; engineered the corporate monopolization of broadcast media; and removed the last safety straps from Wall Street banks. \n※Clinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo.§ \nIn foreign affairs, Clinton initiated what was to become the doctrine of ※humanitarian§ military intervention, dismantling and partially occupying the socialist nation of Yugoslavia. In the process, Clinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo, thus keeping operational the network created by the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Pakistan during the previous decade in Afghanistan. In Africa, Clinton conspired with Uganda and exiled Tutsi rebels to overthrow the Hutu majority government in Rwanda, setting off a bloodbath in 1994, followed two years later by an invasion of Congo that has killed more than six million people -- and still counting. \nBarack Obama was the second DLC president (although he lies about his membership). He, too, moved with unseemly haste to reach a ※Grand Bargain§ with the GOP -- not of necessity, since he had won a huge electoral mandate with the overwhelming financial backing of Wall Street, but as a matter of ideological principle. In January of 2009, before even taking the oath of office, Obama told the editorial boards of the New York Times and the Washington Post that all ※entitlements,§ including Medicare and Social Security, would be ※ on the table § for cutting in his administration. Obama＊s first project, now considered the centerpiece of his legacy, was to resurrect the rightwing Heritage Foundation＊s corporate health insurance scheme, adopted by Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole in 1996, and made into state law by Republican Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, in 2006. Obama＊s Affordable Care Act was, literally, written by lobbyists for the insurance and drug industries, and is now collapsing like a poorly constructed house at the end of its mortgage. \n※For the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his ＆Grand Bargain.＊§ \nWith the Democratic majority in Congress in no mood to tamper with Social Security and Medicare, Obama tried to maneuver the targeted entitlements into a financial crisis trap. He named two dependable reactionaries, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, as co-chairmen of his National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility, also called the Commission on Deficit Reduction. They dutifully recommended $4 trillion in budget cuts, mostly to social programs, including cuts to Social Security. Although the full commission did not endorse the chairs＊ recommendations, and the Congress failed to pass bills modeled on the document, Obama used the Simpson-Bowles formula as a basis for negotiating what he hoped would be a ※bipartisan§ (GOP plus Obama and a minority of Democrats) massacre of entitlements. For the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his ※Grand Bargain.§ Congressional Black Caucus chairman Emanuel Cleaver, of Kansas City, called the deal a ※ Satan＊s Sandwich ,§ but Obama continued to pursue a political marriage made in hell until the 2012 reelection campaign clock called a halt to the spectacle. \n※A de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie.§ \nThe quest for a Grand Bargain was Barack Obama＊s failed attempt to best Bill Clinton in erasing the distinctions between the two major parties 每 to create a de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie. It was the Republicans who ran away from the altar. And the Democrats did eat much of the Satan＊s Sandwich, through sequestration and austerity that ravaged social programs by other means. \nWhy did the Republicans reject the deal? Although both halves of the duopoly ultimately answer to Wall Street, the Republicans, like any other party, have an institutional interest in winning office. It is true that Obama had crafted a deal that any Republican would love, but it was still his deal, and he planned to run for reelection as an historical dealmaker. Probably just as importantly, the Republican Party is the White Man＊s party, meaning, white supremacy is its organizing principle, central to its identity among much of the masses. To embrace Obama, no matter how advantageous to their big business patrons, was a hug too far for the GOP. Racism doomed the Grand Bargain 每 Hallelujah! \nA New, Bigger Bargain \nRecently released Wikileaks emails reveal Hillary Clinton speaking to bankers at Morgan Stanley in 2013, a year after the debacle. ※The Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right,§ she said. \nThanks to Donald Trump＊s demolition of the Republican Party, the conditions have been created for Hillary Clinton, as DLC President #3, to achieve what #1 and #2 could not: gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle. With most of the ruling class and its attendants having vacated the building, the Republican Party has been reduced to Donald Trump and his ※deplorables,§ as Hillary calls them. Trump＊s opposition to corporate trade deals violated the Holy Grail against prohibiting capitalists from moving money and jobs around the world as they see fit, and his reluctance to support regime change as an inherent right of American exceptionalism has frightened and outraged the military industrial complex, the national security establishment, and all sectors dependent on the maintenance of empire. \n※An inherently unstable arrangement.§ \nClinton＊s Big Tent is not a temporary, election season dwelling.

    "text": "2016 presidential campaign by BAR executive editor Glen Ford \nBarack Obama tried to woo Republicans into a ※Grand Bargain§ that would have gutted Social Security. Bill Clinton let loose the banks. But Donald Trump＊s destruction of the Republican Party will allow Hillary Clinton to ※gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle.§ The rich are about to get their best deal yet. Hillary＊s ※Big Tent§ is Obama＊s ※Grand Bargain§ on Steroids by BAR executive editor Glen Ford \n※ The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class.§ \nWhen Donald Trump took a wrecking ball to the Republican Party he provided the unexpected catalyst for completion of the corporate project begun by Bill Clinton, Al Gore and other white Democrats in the 1980s, with the founding of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). To counter relentless attrition of whites to the GOP in their home states, these beleaguered, mostly southern Democrats sought national corporate funding to turn their party decisively to the right. They reckoned, correctly, that a steady stream of corporate capital would allow them to control the new wave of Black voters and politicians that had been mobilized by Rev. Jesse Jackson＊s two presidential campaigns, while strengthening the hand of the South in national Democratic Party calculations. \nBill Clinton became the first DLC president in 1992, and moved swiftly and methodically to narrow the ideological differences between the duopoly parties. He completed much of Ronald Reagan＊s agenda, claiming it as his own; destroyed welfare ※as we knew it§; vastly expanded the mass Black Incarceration regime; pushed NAFTA through Congress over the objections of majorities in his own party; engineered the corporate monopolization of broadcast media; and removed the last safety straps from Wall Street banks. \n※Clinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo.§ \nIn foreign affairs, Clinton initiated what was to become the doctrine of ※humanitarian§ military intervention, dismantling and partially occupying the socialist nation of Yugoslavia. In the process, Clinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo, thus keeping operational the network created by the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Pakistan during the previous decade in Afghanistan. In Africa, Clinton conspired with Uganda and exiled Tutsi rebels to overthrow the Hutu majority government in Rwanda, setting off a bloodbath in 1994, followed two years later by an invasion of Congo that has killed more than six million people -- and still counting. \nBarack Obama was the second DLC president (although he lies about his membership). He, too, moved with unseemly haste to reach a ※Grand Bargain§ with the GOP -- not of necessity, since he had won a huge electoral mandate with the overwhelming financial backing of Wall Street, but as a matter of ideological principle. In January of 2009, before even taking the oath of office, Obama told the editorial boards of the New York Times and the Washington Post that all ※entitlements,§ including Medicare and Social Security, would be ※ on the table § for cutting in his administration. Obama＊s first project, now considered the centerpiece of his legacy, was to resurrect the rightwing Heritage Foundation＊s corporate health insurance scheme, adopted by Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole in 1996, and made into state law by Republican Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, in 2006. Obama＊s Affordable Care Act was, literally, written by lobbyists for the insurance and drug industries, and is now collapsing like a poorly constructed house at the end of its mortgage. \n※For the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his ＆Grand Bargain.＊§ \nWith the Democratic majority in Congress in no mood to tamper with Social Security and Medicare, Obama tried to maneuver the targeted entitlements into a financial crisis trap. He named two dependable reactionaries, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, as co-chairmen of his National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility, also called the Commission on Deficit Reduction. They dutifully recommended $4 trillion in budget cuts, mostly to social programs, including cuts to Social Security. Although the full commission did not endorse the chairs＊ recommendations, and the Congress failed to pass bills modeled on the document, Obama used the Simpson-Bowles formula as a basis for negotiating what he hoped would be a ※bipartisan§ (GOP plus Obama and a minority of Democrats) massacre of entitlements. For the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his ※Grand Bargain.§ Congressional Black Caucus chairman Emanuel Cleaver, of Kansas City, called the deal a ※ Satan＊s Sandwich ,§ but Obama continued to pursue a political marriage made in hell until the 2012 reelection campaign clock called a halt to the spectacle. \n※A de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie.§ \nThe quest for a Grand Bargain was Barack Obama＊s failed attempt to best Bill Clinton in erasing the distinctions between the two major parties 每 to create a de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie. It was the Republicans who ran away from the altar. And the Democrats did eat much of the Satan＊s Sandwich, through sequestration and austerity that ravaged social programs by other means. \nWhy did the Republicans reject the deal? Although both halves of the duopoly ultimately answer to Wall Street, the Republicans, like any other party, have an institutional interest in winning office. It is true that Obama had crafted a deal that any Republican would love, but it was still his deal, and he planned to run for reelection as an historical dealmaker. Probably just as importantly, the Republican Party is the White Man＊s party, meaning, white supremacy is its organizing principle, central to its identity among much of the masses. To embrace Obama, no matter how advantageous to their big business patrons, was a hug too far for the GOP. Racism doomed the Grand Bargain 每 Hallelujah! \nA New, Bigger Bargain \nRecently released Wikileaks emails reveal Hillary Clinton speaking to bankers at Morgan Stanley in 2013, a year after the debacle. ※The Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right,§ she said. \nThanks to Donald Trump＊s demolition of the Republican Party, the conditions have been created for Hillary Clinton, as DLC President #3, to achieve what #1 and #2 could not: gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle. With most of the ruling class and its attendants having vacated the building, the Republican Party has been reduced to Donald Trump and his ※deplorables,§ as Hillary calls them. Trump＊s opposition to corporate trade deals violated the Holy Grail against prohibiting capitalists from moving money and jobs around the world as they see fit, and his reluctance to support regime change as an inherent right of American exceptionalism has frightened and outraged the military industrial complex, the national security establishment, and all sectors dependent on the maintenance of empire. \n※An inherently unstable arrangement.§ \nClinton＊s Big Tent is not a temporary, election season dwelling. It is how she plans to govern. The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class, while at the same time the party nominally represents most of the folks who are abused and misused by that ruling class. It is an inherently unstable arrangement, and will soon be wracked by splits, as a post-Trump GOP attempts to lure its fat cats back and the darker and poorer constituencies consigned to the latrine area of Hillary＊s high class tent break to the Left for air. \nBut in the interim, Clinton will have a unique opportunity to cut grand austerity deals with all the ※big elements§ of Simpson-Bowles, to renege on her corporate trade promises, and to wage war with great gusto in the name of a ※united§ country. Ever since the Democratic National Convention it has been clear that the Clintonites are encouraged to consider everyone outside of their grand circle to be suspect, subversive, or depraved.

    "title": "Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary＊s Benghazi Hearing",
    "text": "Trending Articles: Trending Articles: Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary＊s Benghazi Hearing   Zero Hedge \nIn the latest revelation sure to reignite accusations of collusion between the Clinton campaign and the DOJ, among the recent batch of hacked emails released by Wikileaks, we learn that the day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, Hillary's campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik , who is currently a top official at the US Justice Department serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs. \nPeter Kadzik, with lobbyist Tony Podesta, brother of John Podesta . \nThe post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the Wikileaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just one day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee . \nPodesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta＊s home, another email shows . Another email sent on May 5, 2015 , Kadzik＊s son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. \nAs the Daily Caller notes , the dinner arrangement \"is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state＊s email practices.\" As one former U.S. Attorney tells told the DC, the exchanges are another example of the Clinton campaign＊s ※cozy relationship§ with the Obama Justice Department. \nThe hacked emails confirm that Podesta and Kadzik were in frequent contact. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta＊s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik＊s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. \n※The political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don＊t think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,§ says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. \n※ It＊s the kind of thing the American people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of Hillary Clinton ,§ he added, comparing the Podesta-Kadzik meetings to the revelation that Attorney General Loretta Lynch met in private with Bill Clinton at the airport in Phoenix days before the FBI and DOJ investigating Hillary Clinton. \nKadzik's role at the DOJ, where he started in 2013, is particularly notable Kadzik, as helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. \nA Long, Friendly History \nPodesta and Kadzik have a long history, one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing Clinton email scandal. As DC helps summarize, Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. \nThat history is cited by Podesta in another email hacked from his Gmail account. In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a ※fantastic lawyer§ who ※ kept me out of jail.§ \nAs the DC Chuck Ross notes, it is unclear to which case Podesta was referring and whether he was joking about prison. But Podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the Lewinsky affair and the Rich pardon scandal. As deputy chief of staff to Clinton in 1996, Podesta asked then-United Nations ambassador Bill Richardson to hire the 23-year-old Lewinsky . In April 1996, the White House transferred Lewinsky from her job as a White House intern to the Pentagon in order to keep her and Bill Clinton separate. But the Clinton team also wanted to keep Lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with Clinton. \nRichardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered Lewinsky the position but that she declined it. \nPodesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. ※He did lie to me,§ Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. \nPodesta had been promoted to Clinton＊s chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. \nKadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that ※Kadzik was recruited into Marc Rich＊s lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.§ \nThe report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich＊s pardon. \nOn top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich＊s ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton＊s New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. \nKadzik's current role \nIn his current role as head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. \nBut Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation . \nIn a Feb. 1, 2016 letter in response to Kadzik, Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis noted that Kadzik had explained ※that special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the Attorney General when an investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice would create a potential conflict of interest.§ \nDeSantis, a Republican, suggested that Lynch＊s appointment by Bill Clinton in 1999 as U.S. Attorney in New York may be considered a conflict of interest. He also asserted that Obama＊s political appointees 〞 a list which includes Kadzik 〞 ※are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as Department of Justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. § \nIt is unknown if Kadzik responded to DeSantis＊ questions. \nKadzik＊s first involvement in the Clinton email brouhaha came in a Sept. 24, 2015 response letter to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the DOJ was investigating Clinton. Last month, Politico reported that Kadzik angered Republican lawmakers when, in a classified briefing, he declined to say whether Clinton aides who received DOJ immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes. \nKadzik also testified at a House Oversight Committee hearing last month on the issue of classifications and redactions in the FBI＊s files of the Clinton email investigation.

    "text": "Goldman Sachs Endorses Hillary Clinton For President   Shadowproof \nHe＊s with her. On Sunday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein 〞an endorsement she had been working toward for years. \nAs was revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation. \nOn October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for ※political reasons§ because Congress needed to look like it was doing something about the crisis. She said, ※There＊s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.§ \nYes, she essentially endorsed Wall Street writing the rules because Wall Street knows its business best and complained to Goldman Sachs that regulations had frightened bankers. \n※I mean, right now, there are so many places in our country where the banks are not doing what they need to do because they＊re scared of regulations, they＊re scared of the other shoe dropping, they＊re just plain scared, so credit is not flowing the way it needs to to restart economic growth,§ Clinton said. ※So people are, you know, a little 〞 they＊re still uncertain, and they＊re uncertain both because they don＊t know what might come next in terms of regulations, but they＊re also uncertain because of changes in a global economy that we＊re only beginning to take hold of.§ \nMusic to Wall Street＊s ears. For Goldman Sachs, was there really any other choice this cycle? After all, they did pay Hillary Clinton $675,000 for those three speeches, and have generously supported her political career. \nDespite her private comments to Goldman Sachs, Hillary Clinton has taken a tough public position on Wall Street during the campaign, likely due to Senator Bernie Sanders＊ success in the primaries. Of course, Wikileaks also revealed that Clinton told the National Multi-housing Council in a private speech that ※you need both a public and a private position.§ \nSo the real question is, what do Blankfein and Goldman want in return and what is Clinton＊s private position on giving it to them?

    "text": "Trending Articles: Trending Articles: 21 Things We＊ve Learned About Hillary Clinton from Wikileaks That the MSM Won＊t Share＃But YOU Can!   Daisy Luther \nLet＊s talk about Wikileaks. \nFirst of all, the organization was founded by Julian Assange back in 2006. Their website explains what they are all about: \n※WikiLeaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war, spying, and corruption. It has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses.§ \nIn the 11 years that they＊ve been publishing documents, they have not been disproven a single time. Their record for authentication is perfect. (Learn more here and here .) \nSo this means that a person would be pretty silly to disregard anything in the reams of information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, the Clinton Foundation, and the political shenanigans that would put the Machiavellis to shame. \nHere are 21 of the most important things that have come out about Hillary Clinton, that unfortunately, no one is reporting on in the mainstream. In the interest of brevity, each topic has a link to an article that goes deeper into the leak. (In no particular order.) John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign had a nice cozy dinner with Peter Kadzik, one of the top officials in the Department of Justice＃the day after the Benghazi hearing . Kadzik＊s son also asked for a job on the Clinton campaign, and, the icing on the corruption cupcake? Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch, who famously met with Bill Clinton on her private plane right before Hillary＊s interrogation about Emailgate. ( source ) We all knew that the Clinton Foundation was just a way for the Clinton family to launder money, and now there＊s proof. Zero Hedge writes, ※＃today＊s Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band＊s firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family＊s private business endeavors.§ A pundit called this leak ※The Rosetta Stone of the Clinton Foundation,§ meaning that with this document, all of their shady financial dealings could be unraveled and translated. ( source ) Clinton is unable to speak for very long without a podium to lean on . Numerous leaked emails reference how certain interviews have to be kept short because she＊d be without one. And this article references a very interesting reason why this may be the case 每 surprisingly it isn＊t related to her health. ( source ) The leaks also show that Clinton intends to do her best to restrict the Second Amendment. Brian Fallon, the national press secretary for the Clinton campaign, wrote, ※ Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President 每 universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability .§ According to an analysis on The Daily Sheeple, ※Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook, Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold.§ ( source ) The campaign was concerned that the sexual escapades of Bill Clinton could be likened to those of another disgraced celebrity, Bill Cosby . Political operative Ron Klain sent an urgent email saying that Hillary should anticipate the following questions, § How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did? Is his conduct relevant to your campaign? You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused him? Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?§ ( source ) Clinton＊s campaign deliberately leaked an embarrassing photo of a swimsuit-clad Bernie Sanders to the press, ironically insinuating that it was proof he was bought off by Wall Street. Perez Hilton wrote, ※ Bernie Sanders lounges at elite Martha＊s Vineyard pool, summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists .§ ( source ) Clinton admitted she is out of touch with the middle class in a speech to Goldman-Black Rock in 2014. ※And I am not taking a position on any policy, but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. And I never had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean, were there really rich people, of course there were. My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We had accessible health care. We had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn＊t believe in mortgages. So I lived that. And now, obviously, I＊m kind of far removed because the life I＊ve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy , but I haven＊t forgotten it.§ ( source ) She made this rather NWO remark at a 2013 paid speech to Brazilian bank Banco Itau: ※ My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders , some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.§ ( source ) In a leak of yet another paid speech, this time to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013, Clinton said that Jordan and Turkey ※ can＊t possibly vet all those refugees so they don＊t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.§ Meanwhile, if Clinton has her way , we will be warmly welcoming 65,000 refugees a year, which makes Obama＊s 10,000 a year look like small potatoes. ( source ) Clinton blackmailed the Chinese by telling them that the US would base missiles in the region if they didn＊t exert some control over North Korean aggression. ※ So China, come on. You either control them or we＊re going to have to defend against them ,§ she purportedly told the audience at a Goldman Sachs conference in June 2013. ( source ) In May 2015, Clinton was no longer Secretary of State but was ready to announce she was running for President when she was invited to attend a summit in Morrocco. The implication from the leaked emails was that a $12 million ※donation§ from the king of Morocco was dependent on Clinton attending the summit. Human Abedin, usually loyal to her boss, had concerns . ※ If HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter. She created this mess and she knows it. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this,§ Abedin wrote to Robbie Mook in a November 2014 email. Incidentally, Clinton didn＊t attend. Bill and Chelsea went instead and the $12 million donation was not forthcoming. (source ) Podesta attacked Clinton＊s primary election rival Bernie Sanders for criticizing the Paris climate change agreement. ※ Can you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it? § said Podesta. ( source ) Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria . ※ My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,§ she told employees of the bank in South Carolina, which had paid her about $225,000 to give a speech. ※We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can＊t help themselves. They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we＊re doing and I want credit for it. § (source ) There is indeed a definite link between the Clinton campaign and what MSM is allowed to say. The campaign has colluded directly with media spokespersons that read like a Who＊s Who in American Media : Dan Merica from CNN, Haim Saban of Univision, John Harwood of CNBC and the NY Times, Rebecca Quick of CNBC, Maggie Haberman of NY Times and Politico, John Harris of Politico, Donna Brazile formerly of CNN, Roland Martin of TV-One, Marjorie Pritchard of The Boston Globe, and Louise Mensch of Heat Street. ( source ) As everyone knows, the DNC deliberately screwed Bernie Sanders out of the nomination ( Bonus: Wikileaks also released some of the DNC＊s voicemails on the topic ). There are emails that prove who is actually pulling HRC＊s puppet strings and that puppeteer is George Soros . The shadow government is not just a conspiracy theory 每 it really exists and Hillary＊s job is to keep George Soros happy. ( source ) Excerpts from her speeches to Wall Street read like a guide to two-faced treachery. In them, she clearly points out that sometimes you ※need§ to lie. ※If everybody＊s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.§ ( source ) Wikileaks emails show that back when she still worked for CNN and before she became an employee of the Clinton campaign, Donna Brazile gave Hillary the questions in advance for her ※impromptu§ CNN Town Hall questions. ( source ) The campaign got to ※approve§ articles in influential publications like NY Times, HuffPo, CNN, NBC, CBS, NYT, MSNBC, and Politico, showing a massive collusion with the mainstream media, who has hounded Trump relentlessly in an effort to distract from HRC＊s abysmal candidacy. ( source ) Through the treasure trove of Wikileaks emails, we can gain an accurate picture of how Hillary really feels about us all (spoiler: basket of deplorables, basement dwellers and right wing conspirators) ( source ) President Obama knew the whole time that her emails were not coming from the secure State Department server. Cheryl Mills wrote to John Podesta, ※W e need to clean this up 每 he has emails from her 每 they do not say state.gov .§ You see, Obama＊s emails all have to be from§whitelisted§addresses. So someone, somewhere, added her nonsecure email to his whitelist. ( source ) \nAnd finally, here＊s the real reason that treacherous shrew is involved in politics. And let me tell you, it isn＊t because she yearns to make things better for anyone but herself. (emphasis mine.) \nAt the Goldman Sachs Builders and Innovators Summit, Clinton responded to a question from chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, who quipped that you ※go to Washington§ to ※make a small fortune.§ Clinton agreed with the comment and complained about ethics rules that require officials to divest from certain assets before entering government. ※ There is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives, § Clinton said. ( source ) \nTogether, we cannot be ignored. \nI am on a mission between now and the Presidential Election on November 8th and I hope that you will join me. \nI am going to work day and night to provide the coverage that the mainstream media is not. It isn＊t until we combine all of our voices that we can make people listen to the scandals, the rigging, and the corruption, not only in this election but in the system in general. Please join your voice with mine by liking, sharing, and spreading the word. \nTogether, we cannot be ignored. Together, we are an army. Share This Article...",

    "text": "Schools All Over America Are Closing On Election Day Due To Fears Of Violence \nWill this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News, ※voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.§ Just a couple days ago, I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th.",

    "text": "Blockbuster Audio From '06 of Hillary Proposing RIGGING Palestine Election   Observer \n\nOn September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton＊s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is ※rigged.§Hillary Clinton listens to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speak during the third U.S. presidential debate at the Thomas & Mack Center on October 19, 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada.Hillary Clinton listens to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speak during the third U.S. presidential debate at the Thomas & Mack Center on October 19, 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada.Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).※I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,§ said Sen. Clinton. ※And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.§",

    "title": "John Podesta＊s Sister-in-Law Lobbied For Raytheon While Hillary Was Secretary of State",
    "text": "John Podesta＊s Sister-in-Law Lobbied For Raytheon While Hillary Was Secretary of State   Michael Krieger, Liberty Blitzkrieg \nThe Podesta family seems particularly adept at earning extraordinary sums of money via selling out the American public. Earlier this year, I highlighted how John Podesta＊s brother Tony was paid $140,000 per month by the medieval monarchy of Saudi Arabia. After all, who cares about women＊s rights when the pay is good? \nHere＊s a excerpt from the post, ※Getting Things Done§每 The Brother of Hillary Clinton＊s Campaign Chair is a Major Lobbyist for Saudi Arabia : \nThe kingdom employs a total of eight American firms that perform lobbying, consulting, public relations and legal work. \nFive of the firms work for the Saudi Arabia Embassy, while another two 〞 Podesta Group and BGR Group 〞 have registered to represent the Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court, an arm of the government. PR giant Edelman, meanwhile, is working for the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority to encourage international investment. \nThe Podesta Group is billing Saudi Arabia $140,000 a month for its public relations services. During the last few months of 2015, it sent 27 emails, had two phone calls and one meeting with lawmakers and staffers, journalists, and organizations including Human Rights Watch and the Center for American Progress, disclosure forms show. \nDLA Piper receives $50,000 a month from the kingdom and sent hundreds of emails to top congressional staffers between September and the end of February regarding meeting requests and, more generally, ※issues affecting U.S.-Saudi Arabia national security interests.§ \nNotice the firm DLA Piper mentioned above. You＊ll want to remember that for later. \nMoving along, the Podestas are diligent about making sure everyone gets to feed at the trough, including extended family. \nAs James Rosen of Fox News uncovers: \nAmid the tumult of the 2016 presidential campaign, John Podesta is best known as Hillary Clinton＊s campaign chairman and the individual from whose private account WikiLeaks is presently publishing some 50,000 hacked emails. \nFor several months in 2012, Clinton＊s final year as secretary of state, Raytheon, the leading defense contractor, hired Podesta＊s sister-in-law, Heather Podesta, as a lobbyist, federal records show. \nRaytheon was looking to enlarge its share of foreign military sales 每 transfers of advanced weapons systems to other countries that are reviewed and approved by the Department of State, then implemented by the Department of Defense 每 and was beefing up its lobbying operation to accomplish that goal before Secretary Clinton left office. \nAt the same time, Raytheon retained two other lobbyists, John Merrigan and Matt Bernstein, both associated with the powerhouse D.C. law firm DLA Piper. All three of these lobbyists, including Ms. Podesta, were major donors or bundlers to Hillary Clinton＊s 2008 and 2016 campaigns. Federal records show they have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Clinton＊s campaigns and earned hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying her State Department. \nThere＊s DLA Piper again. They appears to have their fingers in all realms of the military-industrial complex cookie jar. \nIn the final three quarters of 2012, DLA Piper earned some $360,000 in lobbying fees from Raytheon, courting the State Department and other agencies, while Ms. Podesta, within that same time frame, received $100,000 from Raytheon for the same purpose. \nThe gambit appears to have worked: Records maintained by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the arm of the Defense Department that coordinates the transfers of weapons systems once they have received State＊s approval, show Raytheon as a prime contractor in at least seventeen foreign military sales in 2012, worth an estimated total of $26 billion. Of those contracts, three with the Gulf nation of Qatar 每 for missile defense, Apache attack helicopters and other materiel 每 accounted for $19 billion. \nThe individual at the State Department who was statutorily entrusted to approve foreign military sales was Andrew Shapiro, the assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs. Prior to his nomination to that job, Shapiro had served as Clinton＊s national security adviser in her Senate office. Today, Shapiro is a partner in a Washington consulting firm whose other co-founders include Philippe Reines, Clinton＊s longtime press aide. \nYou starting to see how all this works? \nThe firm mentioned above is Beacon Global Strategies, and I covered them in this summer＊s post: New York Times Fails to Disclose Op-Ed Writer＊s Ties to Hillary Clinton＊s ＆Principal Gatekeeper＊ . \nAfter Clinton stepped down as secretary of state in February 2013, Raytheon discontinued the services of Heather Podesta + Partners, and ceased its use of DLA Piper at State. \nWhile experts do not believe any laws were broken, the affair illustrates how Washington worked in the first Obama term, and particularly at the Clinton State Department. The Raytheon operation bears some similarity to a pop-up store that materializes to serve a seasonal need, such as Halloween candy or July Fourth fireworks, then vanishes once that need has been met. \nSimply incredible. \n※I think this is as close an example of pay-to-play as we＊ve seen,§ said Raj Shah, deputy communications director at the Republican National Committee. ※And that＊s why [Raytheon] made these hires [of Heather Podesta, Merrigan and Bernstein]. ＃ Their experience was getting access to Hillary Clinton and raising money for her.§ \nBut hey＃",

    "title": "These Blast Points on Hillary's Campaign... Only The Deep State Is So Precise",
    "text": "These Blast Points on Hillary's Campaign... Only The Deep State Is So Precise   Charles Hugh Smith \nThe Deep State's most prescient elements must derail Hillary's campaign to clear a path to Trump's executive team. \nBack in August, I asked Could the Deep State Be Sabotaging Hillary? I think we now have a definitive answer: \"These blast points on Hillary's campaign... too accurate for the Mainstream Media. Only the forces of the Imperial Deep State are so precise.\" \nThe Mainstream Media is presenting the FBI investigation as a \"lose-lose\" situation for embattled FBI Director Comey. If Comey remained quiet until after the election, he would be accused of colluding with the Clinton campaign and its allies in the Department of Justice (sic). \nBut in going public, he stands accused by Democrats of \"intervening in an election,\" i.e. raising doubts about Hillary's judgement and veracity days before Americans go to the polls. \nAnother narrative has Comey's hand forced by the threat of disgusted FBI agents leaking information that would show the FBI caved into political pressure from the Democratic Party and Clinton campaign to keep relevant material out of the public eye until after the election. \nI submit another much more powerful dynamic is in play: the upper ranks of the Deep State now view Hillary as an unacceptable liability. The word came down to Comey to act whether he wanted to or not, i.e. take one for the good of the nation/Deep State/Imperial Project. \nAs a refresher: the Deep State is the unelected government (also called the invisible or shadow government) that is not as monolithic as generally assumed. \nThe neo-conservative globalists who want Hillary to continue pushing their agenda are the more visible camp, but another less visible but highly motivated camp realizes Hillary and her neo-con agenda would severely damage the nation's security and its global influence. It is this camp that is arranging for Hillary to lose. \nThe consensus view seems to be that the Establishment and the Deep State see Trump as a loose cannon who might upset the neo-con apple cart by refusing to toe the neo-con line. \nThis view overlooks the reality that significant segments of the Deep State view the neo-con strategy as an irredeemable failure. To these elements of the Deep State, Hillary is a threat precisely because she embraces the failed neo-con strategy and those who cling to it. From this point of view, Hillary as president would be an unmitigated disaster for the Deep State and the nation/Imperial Project it governs. \nWhatever else emerges from the emails being leaked or officially released, one conclusion is inescapable: Hillary's judgement is hopelessly flawed. Combine her lack of judgement with her 24 years of accumulated baggage and her potential to push the neo-con agenda to the point of global disaster, and you get a potent need for the Deep State's most prescient elements to derail her campaign and clear a path to Trump's executive team. \nOnce this path is clear, the management of Trump's executive team can begin in earnest, a management process aimed at disengaging the nation and its global Empire from neo-con overreach. \nIf you think this scenario is \"impossible,\" let's see how the election plays out before deciding what's \"impossible\" and what's inevitable.",

    "text": "GOOGLE PLANNED MASSIVE AI INTEGRATED SOCIAL NETWORK SPY TOOL FOR HILLARY CAMPAIGN IN 2014   Source: Higgins News Network \nA newly released Podesta email reveals that Google CEO Eric Schmidt contacted the Hillary campaign in 2014 to begin their partnership in sponsoring Clinton＊s campaign run for President in 2016. \nThe revelations come from a memo in the email sent to Cherry Mills which was then forwarded Robby Mook, John Podesta, and David Plouffe. \nSchmidt＊s memo outlines an overall campaign strategy for Hillary, Schmidt＊s vision for a massive cloud-based AI integrate software program and also reveals that Google colluded with the Obama administration in the 2012 election. \nThe memo goes on to layout plans to construct a massive cloud-based database, along with programs that leveraged machine learning (aka Artificial Intelligence) that would be used to first to track users online to create a partial digital voter ids. \nThose partial digital ids contain a collection of attributes about the users online behavior which Schmidt explains will all eventually be tied to a real voter id file by leveraging machine learning. \nSchmidt details the procurement of a development team and the use of outline money to create software that will be connected to users smart phones on 2016 that would allow volunteers the ability to access any and all voter data. \nSchmidt also outlines ideas for the using the integrated tool to monitor social media and news stories to help promote positive articles and target the source of ※rumors§ and negative articles. \nGiven Google＊s massive collection of personal user data combined with previous revelations that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg and Facebook COO were colluding with Hillary raises series concerns above user privacy, media manipulation and host of other problems. \nThat combined with the fact that just about every other Silicon Valley company and executive is behind the Hillary Campaign makes this a chilling memo that should be getting much more attention than it is. \nPresented in full: \nSecondary verification by google.com DKIM key \nFwd: 2016 thoughts \nDate: Tue, Apr 15, 2014 at 1:56 PMSubject: 2016 thoughts \nCheryl, I have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and I havescheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better. This is simply a draft but dolet me know if this is a helpful process for you all. Thanks !! Eric \n\nNotes for a 2016 Democratic CampaignEric Schmidt \nHere are some comments and observations based on what we saw in the 2012campaign. If we get started soon, we will be in a very strong position toexecute well for 2016. \n1. Size, Structure and Timing \nLets assume a total budget of about $1.5Billion, with more than 5000 paidemployees and million(s) of volunteers. The entire startup ceasesoperation four days after November 8, 2016 . The structure includes aChairman or Chairwoman who is the external face of the campaign and aPresident who is the executive in charge of objectives, measurements,systems and building and managing the organization. \nEvery day matters as our end date does not change. An official campaignright after midterm elections and a preparatory team assembled now is best. \n2. Location \nThe campaign headquarters will have about a thousand people, mostly youngand hardworking and enthusiastic. Its important to have a very largehiring pool (such as Chicago or NYC) from which to choose enthusiastic,smart and low paid permanent employees. DC is a poor choice as its full ofdistractions and interruptions. Moving the location from DC elsewhereguarantees visitors have taken the time to travel and to help. \nThe key is a large population of talented people who are dying to work foryou. Any outer borough of NYC, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston are all goodexamples of a large, blue state city to base in. \nEmployees will relocate to participate in the campaign, and will find lowcost temporary housing or live with campaign supporters on a donated basis.This worked well in Chicago and can work elsewhere. \nThe computers will be in the cloud and most likely on Amazon Web services(AWS) . All the campaign needs are portable computers, tablets and smartphones along with credit card reader s. \n3. The pieces of a Campaign \na) The Field \nIts important to have strong field leadership, with autonomy andempowerment. Operations talent needs to build the offices, set up thesystems, hire the people, and administer what is about 5000 people.Initial modeling will show heavy hiring in the key battleground states.There is plenty of time to set these functions up and build the humansystems. T he field is about organizing people, voter contact, and get outthe vote programs. \nFor organizing tools, build a simple way to link people and activities as aworkflow and let the field manage the system, all cloud based. Build asimple organizing tool with a functioning back-end. Avoid deep integrationas the benefits are not worth it. Build on the cloud. Organizing isreally about sharing and linking people, and this tool would measure andtrack all of it. \nThere are many other crucial early investments needed in the field:determining the precise list of battleground states, doing early polling toconfirm initial biases, and maintaining and extending voter protectionprograms at the state level. \nb) The Voter \nKey is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates allthat is known about them. In 2016 smart phones will be used to identify,meet, and update profiles on the voter. A dynamic volunteer can easilyspeak with a voter and, with their email or other digital handle, get thevoter videos and other answers to areas they care about (※the benefits ofACA to you§ etc.) \nThe scenario includes a volunteer on a walk list, encountering a potentialvoter, updating the records real time and deepening contact with the voterand the information we have to offer. \nc) Digital \nA large group of campaign employees will use digital marketing methods toconnect to voters, to offer information, to use social networks to spreadgood news, and to raise money. Partners like Blue State Digital will domuch of the fund raising. A key point is to convert BSD and other partnersto pure cloud service offerings to handle the expected crush and load. \nd) Media (paid), (earned) and (social), and polling \nNew tools should be developed to measure reach and impact of paid, earnedand social media. The impact of press coverage should be measurable inreach and impact, and TV effectiveness measured by attention and othersurveys. \nBuild tools that measure the rate and spread of stories and rumors , andmodel how it works and who has the biggest impact. Tools can tell us aboutthe origin of stories and the impact of any venue, person or theme .Connect polling into this in some way. \nFind a way to do polling online and not on phones. \ne) Analytics and data science and modeling, polling and resourceoptimization tools \nFor each voter, a score is computed ranking probability of the right vote.Analytics can model demographics, social factors and many other attributesof the needed voters. Modeling will tell us what who we need to turn outand why, and studies of effectiveness will let us know what approaches workwell. Machine intelligence across the data should identify the mostimportant factors for turnout, and preference. \nIt should be possible to link the voter records in Van with upcomingdatabases from companies like Comcast and others for media measurementpurposes. \nThe analytics tools can be built in house or partnered with a set ofvendors. \nf) Core engineering, voter database and contact with voters online \nThe database of voters (NGP Van) is a fine starting point for voter recordsand i s maintained by the vendor (and needs to be converted to the cloud ).The code developed for 2012 (Narwahl etc. ) is unlikely to be used, andreplaced by a model where the vendor data is kept in the Van database andintermediate databases are arranged with additional information for a voter. \nQuite a bit of software is to be developed to match digital identities withthe actual voter file with high confidence . The key unit of the campaignis a ※voter§, and each and every record is viewable and updatable byvolunteers in search of more accurate information . \nIn the case w here we can＊t identify the specific human , we can still have a partial digital voter id , for a person or ※probable-person§ with attributesthat we can identify and use to targe t. As they respond we can eventuallymatch to a registered voter in the main file. This digital key iseventually matched to a real person . \nThe Rules \nIts important that all the player in the campaign work at cost and there beno special interests in the financing structure . This means that allvendors work at cost and there is a separate auditing function to ensure noone is profiting unfairly from the campaign. All investments and conflictsof interest would have to be publicly disclosed. The rules of the auditshould include caps on individual salaries and no investor profits from thecampaign function. (For example, this rule would apply to me.) \nThe KEY things \na) early b uild of an integrated development team and recognition that thisis an entire system that has to be managed as suchb) decisions to exclusively use cloud solutions for scalability, and choiceof vendors and any software from 2012 that will be reused.c) the role of the smart phone in the hands of a volunteer. The smartphone manages the process, updates the database, informs the citizen, andallows fundraising and recruitment of volunteers (on android and iphone).d) early and continued focus of qualifying fundraising dollars to build thefield, and build all the tools. Outside money will be plentiful andperfect for TV use. A smart media mix tool tells all we need to know aboutmedia placement, TV versus other media and digital media .",

    "title": "Not Just Hillary, Entire Obama Administration Exposed for Using Private Email to Avoid FOIA Requests",
    "text": "Not Just Hillary, Entire Obama Administration Exposed for Using Private Email to Avoid FOIA Requests   Source: Jack Burns \nWikileaks is helping President Obama keep his 2008 campaign promise 〞 to be the most transparent administration in U.S. history 〞 whether he likes it or not. And, once again, we＊re learning more about the inner sanctum of the administration and its communication practices. As FBI Director James Comey announced Friday, a new investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s email scandal has been launched, just days before the presidential election. Comey＊s move drew fire instantly from the Democrats who claim Comey is attempting to sway the election in Donald Trump＊s favor. While many are focused on Comey＊s actions and renewed investigation, Wikileaks has uncovered what may prove to be a systemic problem of executive branch accountability not merely limited to the former secretary of state＊s emails. \nAccording to former State Department official Tom Nides, in a 2015 email to John Podesta (Clinton campaign manager), everyone in Obama＊s cabinet and every White House staffer uses their personal email for government business. Nides should know as he worked under Hillary Clinton in the State Department from 2011 to 2013, according to one source . \nWhile keeping email hidden from the public may seem like no big deal to folks who simply don＊t care, ALL correspondence which is related to governmental business is the property of the federal government and is supposed to be accessible by anyone wishing to inquire within the archive of records. \nThe Federal Records Act defines a record as anything, ※regardless of whether it exists in physical, digital, or electronic form, is a record as defined in subsection (a) shall be binding on all Federal agencies.§ This includes all communication of state agents (like the POTUS) who work in the executive branch of government, as well. \nBut the Obama administration, according to Nides, has long since avoided the Federal Records Act by using private Gmail accounts. Nides wrote Podesta and said, ※There is only one thing that needs to be done on this email thing. (Which I am sure nobody wants to do). Get a state dept career lawyer to go through all the emails and pull the official ones.§ That admission seems to be on the level with what is expected for compliance with the Federal Records Act. But it was Nides＊ next admission which is the talk of many major media outlets. \nNides wrote, ※Btw you know as well as I every god damn cabinet officer and WH staff uses their [sic] gmail account!§ The former Department of State employee revealed what many already suspected. The Obama administration is anything but transparent. Just ask Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. His organization routinely sues the Obama administration in federal court using the Freedom of Information Act as warrant for inquiry, and says the administration stonewalls his efforts at every turn. Fitton＊s organization gave the Obama administration a failing grade on transparency and says his administration is even less transparent than when Bush was president. \nFitton wrote in 2015 , ※There are about 18 lawsuits, 10 of which are active in federal court, and about 160 Judicial Watch FOIA requests that could be affected by Mrs. Clinton and her staff＊s use of secret email accounts to conduct official government business. In our various FOIA lawsuits, our lawyers have informed attorneys for the Obama administration that Hillary Clinton＊s account and any other secret accounts used by State employees should be secured, recovered and searched.§ JW actively seeks out those files through official methods, using FOIA and the Federal Records Act, but has been met with delay after delay from FOIA requests to the Obama administration. \nWhile the Obama administration is on its way out, groups like Judicial Watch aren＊t going anywhere, and presumably have all the time in the world to FOIA their way into digging up those deleted Clinton emails, as well as securing Gmail accounts from the Obama administration cabinet and staffers. This story is definitely a long way from being over. \nIt＊s no wonder why so many free thinkers are now questioning the story lines they＊re being told. With the president and all his men (and women), hiding their communications within their Gmail accounts, the truth is never going to be told, at least not the real truth. And by the time organizations like Judicial Watch are successful in obtaining the electronic communications records that rightly belong to the people, it will be way too late to hold anyone accountable for breaking both the Federal Records Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Julian Assange, we salute you. Thank you for forcing the Obama administration to be transparent. Keep up the valiant work!",

    "text": "Hillary Clinton＊s Wall Street Fundraising Benefited From Loophole In Federal Anti-Corruption Rule   Source: IBT \nDespite an anti-corruption rule that was designed to reduce the financial industry＊s political power, top officials from the investment firm BlackRock hosted Hillary Clinton at campaign fundraisers earlier this year. \nThe cash 〞 which poured in through a loophole in the law 〞 came in as BlackRock＊s federal contracts to manage billions of dollars of retiree assets will be up for renewal during the next president＊s term. \nIn 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission looked to stop campaign donations to public officials from financial firms seeking to convince those officials to hire them to manage public employees＊ retirement assets. The agency enacted a pay-to-play rule that applied such a restriction to state and local officials. The rule, however, was structured in a way that effectively exempted federal agencies from its restrictions 〞 and it was created even though a major federal agency had just been plagued by an investment-related influence-peddling scandal. \nIn practice, the gap in the rule allows BlackRock executives to raise big money for presidential candidates who 〞 if they win 〞 will appoint the officials that run the federal Thrift Savings Plan, which awards contracts to manage retirement assets for nearly 5 million current and former federal employees. The loophole also allows Wall Street executives to give cash to presidential candidates, even as those executives＊ firms get deals to manage 〞 and earn fees from 〞 investments for the federal government＊s separate pension insurance agency, which is run by presidential appointees. \nIn all, the loophole in the SEC rule effectively leaves nearly a half-trillion dollars of retirement assets unprotected by the nation＊s major anti-corruption measure. Clinton＊s presidential campaign has raised more than $1 million from financial firms that are contracted to manage those assets.",

    "title": "Breaking: FBI Reopens Investigation Into Hillary Email Scandal As New Emails Were Found",
    "text": "The FBI recently decided to reopen their investigation of Hillary Clinton after more emails from her private email server during her time as head of the State Department were leaked.\nSenior news editor and writer for NBC Bradd Jaffy , among others, just tweeted the document hours ago, showing the letter to members of Congress and outlining how the FBI is investigating additional emails.\n※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,§ Comey wrote to the chairmen. ※I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.§ \nYou can read the full letter here .\n \n\nThe FBI still has yet to assess the importance of the material to see if any classified material was leaked, and if so, how significant it was.\nComey has also been criticized by lawmakers and others who are saying that the investigation has been downplayed and mishandled.\nThere are also some other strange allegations emerging. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal , Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe sent more than half a million dollars in campaign funds and material support to the wife of an FBI official who was a part of the investigation of Hillary Clinton＊s personal email server. It was recently revealed that Clinton performed all of her business as Secretary of State from this server, including sharing classified information.\nYou can read more about that here .\nWhy Does This Matter? With all the information that has come out recently exposing the truth behind Western politics, it＊s shedding light on the fact we are being misled and that there are extreme amounts of corruption in politics. Politicians are being used by big corporations and banks to push elitist agendas.\nThis is a time for reflection for us all as the external happenings of our world show us what is really going on. As things become more obvious it gives us a chance to see it VERY clearly -it＊s happening for a reason. Is it time to discuss taking a different approach to our world? I think so.\nThis is a great quote that fits perfectly here:\n※The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society . Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.§ \n每 Edward Bernays, The Father of Public Relations, Propaganda , 1928 \nWhat Are We Focusing On? Every four years we turn our attention to the presidential race, while the fact remains, as Bernie Sanders told us earlier in the year, that ※no matter who is elected to be president, that person will not be able to address the enormous problems facing the working families of our country. They will not be able to succeed because of the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, and the power of campaign donors is so great that no president alone can stand up to them.§ ( source )\nInstead of ※standing up to them,§ they simply do what they are told. One example would be the transcripts of Hillary Clinton＊s paid speeches to Goldman Sachs .\nPoliticians seem to now function as mere frontmen for these corporations, the ones to answer our questions, alleviate our fears, and ultimately, bear the brunt of our anger.\nBut at the end of the day there is something we must not forget:\n※ a power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves, consisting of many, and various, and powerful interests, combined into one mass, and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks.§ John C. Calhoun ( source )\nShadow Government It＊s no longer a secret that the global consolidation of power lies in the hands of very few 〞 a small group of people and the corporations they run, all held together by the world of finance 〞 or that this few controls every aspect of our lives.\nBelow is a great clip from the Thrive documentary by Foster Gamble, heir to the Proctor Gamble corporation. He was groomed for the establishment, but chose a different path.\nThese are the ones we need to shed more light on if we are going to turn things around. The power these corporations and banks have is unacceptable, and politics, at the end of the day, although a good tool that can be used to wake up the masses, is a distraction and waste of time.\nIt takes the power out of our hands, and places it in the hands of others 〞 while we watch what they do with it and hope it benefits us.\nAwareness! This is about awareness. Awareness so we can begin having discussions about what to do next and pulling our consciousness away from the illusion that is before. It is becoming more and more obvious so we can let it go.\nIt＊s fitting to leave you with this last quote from Theodore Roosevelt. Combined with all of the evidence, it＊s interesting to think about.\n※Political parties exist to secure responsible government and to execute the will of the people.\nFrom these great tasks both of the old parties have turned aside. Instead of instruments to promote the general welfare, they have become the tools of corrupt interests which use them impartially to serve their selfish purposes. Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government, owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.\nTo destroy this invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.§ ( source )",

We＊ve seen this with Al-Qaeda, and various documents that have tied them to U.S. intelligence agencies like the CIA. We＊ve also seen a lot of shady circumstances surrounding the ※terrorist§ attacks that occurred on 9/11; the evidence alone has approximately half of the American people believing it was an inside job 每 a simple Google search of the polls will show you that, and for the evidence we are referring to, you can access our articles on that topic here . ※All three buildings were destroyed by carefully planned, orchestrated and executed controlled demolition.§ 每 Professor Lynn Margulis, Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts at Amherst and National Academy of Science member, one of many academics who has been very outspoken regarding 9/11 ( source ) ( source ) All of this activity continues to be used as more justification for a heightened national security state, one in which citizens are being forced to give up their freedoms and privacy in order to be ※protected§ from such attacks. The entire national security state would crumble if people found out that it was their own government perpetrating these attacks, and this realization is finally beginning to leave the realm of conspiracy and enter into the realm of reality in the minds of the masses. It＊s about time. ※Most terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We＊ve become a lunatic asylum.§ 每 David Steele, a 20-year Marine Corps intelligence officer, and the second-highest-ranking civilian in the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence ( source )   The ※terrorists§ we are pointing our fingers at (or so I believe, along with many others, after having done careful research) are a creation of Western intelligence, used to justify the infiltration of other countries for ulterior motives. Those who usually do not believe that, almost one hundred percent of the time have not actually done any research, or examined the information for themselves. This is the power mainstream media has over us 每 if something is depicted on television, it＊s instantly believed without question. Any other explanation which does not come from a major mainstream media outlet (like CNN, for example), or fit the framework of accepted knowledge, seems to be met with harsh resistance. This resistance comes despite the fact that a tremendous amount of evidence is available in the form of videos, documents, and whistle-blowers, yet a large majority of people still refuse to do any research for themselves, or again, believe something contrary to what Western media is telling them. ※The truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, and any informed intelligence officer knows this. But, there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an intensified entity representing the ＆devil＊ only in order to drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism. The country behind this propaganda is the United States.§ 每 Former British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook",

    "text": "Posted by Lindsay Hayward | Nov 4, 2016 | Breaking News Hillary Clinton says Trump is ※unstable§ to be president and will start a nuclear war. \nFormer president, Bill Clinton, allowed rangers to die in Somalia because he wouldn＊t send air support. There were actually 4,417 military deaths from 1993-1996 alone under the reign of Clinton. He obviously rubbed off on his wife for not having any respect at all for our brave men and women in uniform. How to turn $12,000 in retirement savings into $1.3 Millon over the next 5 years.... Read More \nHillary also denied air support to soldiers in Benghazi who died horrific deaths while she was Secretary of State. \nAmbassador Chris Stevens was brutally beaten to death and murdered in Benghazi, his lifeless body dragged throughout streets of full-fledged violence, terrorists cheering and applauding. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton and President Obama did nothing . \nExcept for blame the tragedy on a video at the victims＊ military funeral ceremony as their coffins crossed in front of the stage, where Hillary Clinton stood. \nIt was a terrorist attack- the attack came in two separate waves, including suicide bombers. WikiLeaks confirms that Hillary told her daughter that she knew it was not because of ＆some video＊. \nSo, how else does Bill influence Hillary? Does he encourage her to lie because it＊s what he personally does? Or does lying simply come naturally for her? \nOver the past month, WikiLeaks has poured out incriminating evidence proving corruption within our liberal government. \nThey＊ve also released countless emails exposing the fraudulent activities tied to the Clinton Foundation, which is currently being investigated by the FBI. \nWhat other shocking lies have been revealed about the Clintons by WikiLeaks? \n※Instead of dark and divisive, it＊s hopeful and inclusive. It＊s big-hearted, not small-minded. It is about lifting people up, not putting them down,§ Hillary Clinton stated in front of a ※massive§ crowd in Ohio, unveiled to be photo-shopped to include more people than were actually present by duplicating the ones that were already there. Hillary Clinton crowd in Ohio, photoshopping to make her rally look bigger \n※It＊s a vision that says, and I believe this with all my heart, we are stronger together.§ Concludes former Secretary of State. \nWords like ※hopeful,§§big-hearted,§ and ※lifting people up§ are the same cliches she fed the people of Haiti. They bought what she was selling- Americans should not make this grave mistake. This will actually bring about the civil war she speaks of- instead of Haitian immigrants protesting in front of the Clinton Foundation office in NY, all Americans will be protesting in front of the White House in D.C.. \nClinton warned that Trump could bring the nation to war ※because of his unstable character,§ which is hilarious. \nAccording to Breitbart , ※Clinton specifically referred to the Civil War, suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from Donald Trump.§ \nBreitbart continues, ※Clinton warned that it would only take a few minutes of instability from Trump launching the United States into a full scale nuclear war.§ \nHow can she make a leader of another nation so distrusting of her after she sells them 20% of American uranium, aiding them in building the very nuclear technology she claims they will use? Putin hates her and she＊s not even president! \nHillary Clinton also said, ※Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges 每 the challenge posed by slavery 每 and we fought a civil war.§ \nCrooked Hillary Clinton doesn＊t reserve the right to quote the great Abraham Lincoln. She is the one with the track record of inflicting people to slavery backed by her actions in Haiti. \nShe is full of hypocrisy, her lack of character is exhausting from what＊s been provided by WikiLeaks via her own email correspondence. But her own words are what incriminate her the most. \n※It was called Hillarycare before Obamacare!§ Then she claims she never supported Obamacare. \n※Chelsea was jogging at the twin towers when they were hit.§ No, Hillary, Chelsea was just at home, in bed, cited by you after people called you out for lying. Hillary Clinton is a pathological liar. \nShe lies about everything, it＊s in her nature. Hillary Clinton is a sociopath that lies for no apparent reason. \nSpeaking of lies, WikiLeaks also proved that the women suddenly accusing Donald Trump of sexual misconduct were paid by the Clintons. \nIt doesn＊t take the support of deleted emails to show that women suddenly coming forward (against the only other candidate) with just weeks left until a huge election are obviously meant to shift attention away from the real issues of Hillary＊s email server. \nTrump has overcome lies and scandals perpetrated by Hillary Clinton, spewed by the mainstream media as well as our very own president and guess what? He has kept his cool. Donald J. Trump, American strength and integrity. \nDonald Trump has overcome adversity throughout this presidential campaign and shown incredible strength in his character. He＊s had to humbly address obvious lies and falsely organized scandals, media slander, biased-coverage, rape-allegations by women he met once and the list just keeps going. \nNot once did President Donald Trump, I mean, republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, get enraged and act like a looney. With everything thrown at him over the past few weeks, he has handled these vicious attacks swimmingly well. \n※Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis,§ she told her supporters. ※Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin.§ \nWe need a strong leader, one that is going to bring about change. We need someone who can remain calm when dealing with a crisis, not act petty or prioritize covering up corruption to saving lives. America needs Donald Trump as president. \nHillary Clinton encourages our own people to fight with one another instead of come together. Vote for Donald Trump, let＊s truly stand together as one, against the corruption Americans currently face. \nIt＊s time American citizens stopped sitting back, accepting another apology from Hillary Clinton for lying. We need to break up with her, not appoint her as leader of our nation. \nLet＊s truly make America great again.",

    "text": "Posted by Lindsay Hayward | Nov 2, 2016 | Liberal Corruption Assange exposes John Podesta and Hillary Clinton \nFrom a young age, Americans learn what ※basic behavior§ is accepted in modern society. Part of that learning curve teaches children to never lie. These children grow up into successful, trustworthy adults, right? How To Make An Organic Super Food For Survial At Home - Watch Video Click Here \nLawyers, doctors, government officials, and so on are all supposed to be upstanding citizens. They are supposed to represent truth and freedom for our nation. \nWhere there is great responsibility, there is also opportunity to abuse this power. Hillary Clinton＊s appointed chairman, John Podesta, is familiar with this all too well. \nTruth seeker and founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has released Hillary Clintons deleted emails from her private server to make Americans aware of what＊s going on. \nIn a world where it＊s difficult to tell what＊s right and what＊s wrong anymore, its natural to feel fear. However, ※fear§ is what people like Hillary Clinton thrive on. \nThe FBI is revisiting the initial Clinton email scandal and has provided newly declassified information about the Clinton Foundation via the FBI Vault . \nIn an email sent to Cheryl Mills from John Podesta the evening of March 2, 2015, hours after the New York Times reported that Clinton possibly violated federal record requirements by using the private server, a shocking revelation has been uncovered. \nAccording to the latest batch of Podesta＊s hacked emails, Podesta writes, ※Not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later.§ \nMills responded, ※Think you just got your new nick name.§ \nThe ※Lanny§ reference is to lawyer Lanny Davis, who served as special counsel to former President, Bill Clinton. Lawyers, unfortunately, are not always the most honest individuals and have been known to cover up for their guilty clients. Hillary Clinton is one of these lawyers. \nCheryl Mills is the same woman who oversaw the controversial construction of a South Korean sweat shop being built in Haiti. A week after this email exchange took place, Hillary Clinton announced that she would love nothing more than to share her emails with the general public, claiming she had nothing to hide. At least, she didn＊t think she did. \nAfter being subpoenaed by federal court, Hillary Clinton acid-washed her private server, deleting thousands of emails. She denied, under oath, that classified information was ever on the server or sent/discussed via her private email address. Do you think Hillary Clinton ever gets tired of lying, each lie covering up the next? \nAcid-washing a server costs a pretty penny. If she truly had nothing to hide, why did she completely bleach her server free of everything? \nThanks to leaked emails from WikiLeaks, it has been proven that Hillary lied when she said no classified information had ever been involved with her private server- Not only was there classified information stored and talked about, but hackers were able to intercept the data and correspondence. \nNew York Post comments, ※Democrats on the House Oversight Committee point to Clinton tweeting on March 4, 2015, calling on the State Department to release her 55,000 pages of work files.§ \n※I want the public to see my email,§ Hillary wrote two days after the Podesta message. \nAt the time, the real Lanny Davis was in support of Clinton addressing her emails. \nAnother WikiLeaks email displays members of the Clinton Organization getting frustrated with Davis＊ public voicing. \n※We gotta zap Lanny out of our universe,§ campaign manager Robby Mook wrote Podesta March 8, 2015. ※Can＊t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.§ \nGood thing for Lanny Davis, ※zap§ doesn＊t equate to ※wet-work.§ \nAlthough Davis may have been rash to announce and support Hillary Clinton＊s innocence, the DNC had major issues with it. \nDavis told Fox News host Chris Wallace, during a televised interview, about Hillary Clinton＊s private email server- ※there can be a neutral party to review all these records 每 nothing unlawful.§ \nApparently, Davis wasn＊t given the memo by Hillary Clinton＊s team regarding her bleached server and it＊s true contents. \n※I think it is a reasonable idea if anybody has any doubts that there＊s a delete on a hard drive- to have an independent go inspect her private e-mail?§ Davis added. \nHillary Clinton is known for lying, her own chairman doesn＊t even believe her when she claims she ※forgets§ things. Even Podesta Knows She Is A Liar \nHillary Clinton wouldn＊t know honesty if it slapped her in the face. She is a psychopathic liar that thirsts for ways to obscenely scam on a global spectrum. \nShe calls out Donald Trump for ※using the system§ but in no way has he abused the system in the grand scale that the Clintons have. He＊s a business man, he was simply following the laws that government had implemented. \nFloods of emails and documents are being leaked every day by Anonymous, WikiLeaks and the FBI. These are desperate cries for help mostly from whistle blowers who have been intimately involved with the government, trying to warn American citizens of certain madness and despair that awaits us if Hillary Clinton wins presidency. \nDonald J. Trump genuinely cares for the American people. He is a natural leader, he enjoys helping people because he believes in bettering America, not policies that encourage ＆pay for play＊. \nHillary Clintons transparency is starting to become blurred. Shatter the busted deception and lock everyone involved with the Clinton scandals in prison. \nDonald Trump recognizes the need for America to rebuild, which starts with depleting government corruption and replacing government officials. This is something Hillary could never accomplish. Hillary Clinton would just hire her friends and abuse her position of power, as she＊s done for nearly four decades. \nJohn Podesta suggested that Hillary Clinton delete her emails- he must believe she is capable of worse than sharing classified information and as president of the United States, who would stop her from committing even more crime? She would put each and every one of our lives on the line and not think twice. \nJohn Podesta doesn＊t even believe in her, why should America?",

    "text": "Posted by Elliot Bougis | Nov 16, 2016 | Breaking News Just when you thought it was safe to go back on the Internet＃ \nI have been reporting for weeks now about the D.C.-based ※pizza pedophilia§ ring that is being exposed based on thousands of ※Podesta emails§ released by Wikileaks in the past month or two. \nAs of last week, the case became even more explosive. \n〞 Thomas Bernpaine (@ThomasBernpaine) November 11, 2016 \nNow, don＊t get nervous because it looks like computer mumbo-jumbo. You only need to remember two things. \n1 每Every picture file is actually a code/pattern of numbers that our computers ※translate§ into images on the screen. \n2 每 Some ※extra§ information has been discovered in at least one picture code/pattern from a Wikileaks email. \nI reported weeks ago about this ※pedo ring§ something called ※photo steganography,§ which is just the fancy term for the two points I explained just now. \nThe image (.jpg) of the two girls eating pizza was discovered as an attachment in the Podesta emails by Wikileaks. Data can be hidden in a .jpg file. In that image, a zipped directory (PK) was hidden inside. That doesn＊t happen by accident. The directory likely contains illegal imagery and/or discussion. It is highly suggestive of illegal activity connected to child pornography, child exploitation, and child abuse. \nSome have objected that the pizza.jpg file size is simply too small to contain any useful data (like an image, a link, a message, etc.), but the point is this: all the file would have to ※smuggle§ is a short password to open a secret website or .zip file. The hidden data could literally just be a few bits of information but it could open up thousands of gigabytes of data in the right website or compressed file. That＊s how the users would access the dirty pictures, videos, messages, etc. \nSo, from a technical angle, this method is very possible, and it makes sense of why the Podesta emails include so many strange photo attachments. Are all those attachments little ※Trojan ponies§ for sharing images, videos, passwords, payment resources, etc.? \nWATCH (Language/NSFW Warning): ※Why do we even have an FBI? Is the FBI just covering for these people?§ \nLet me be honest: \nI have researched corruption cases like this for many years, whether in current events or from historical records. So, I believe I have a somewhat thick skin when it comes to facing human sinfulness and evil like this. \nLast Friday night, however, I won＊t lie: I totally lost it. \nAll of a sudden, too many lightbulbs went off at once, too many connections hit me at once, too many implications dawned on me at once每and I just went into a kind of panic attack about how massive this whole cartel is, how well protected it is, and how truly destructive it is in real children＊s lives. \nIf you want to get an idea of what set me off, let me show you three images. \nBUT I WARN YOU: When you understand the context, these images are EXTREMELY DISTURBING. \nFirst, here is a photo of Tony Podesta＊s favorite work of art in his home: \nTony Podesta is a big fan of ※The Arch of Hysteria§ \nNext, here is an ad from Ping Pong Pizza, a restaurant in D.C. that has numerous, very disturbing connections to pedophilia and D.C. elites like the Podestas. Another ※arch of hysteria§? \nNext we come to a police photo from the Jeffrey Dahmer case. \nVIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED: \nI wonder if Tony Podesta would also like this ※arch of hysteria§＃ \nFinally, here is the logo for Comet Pizza, another D.C. restaurant with deep connections to Ping Pong Pizza and the Podestas. Can you see now why I ※lost my [bleep]§ last Friday? \nWorse, in terms of how protected this satanic ring of perverts is, I recently reported that even the DOJ is compromised . \nA man named Arun Rao has shown a disturbing interest in some sexually ※creepy§ images and expressions that are connected to the Podestas and this pedo ring. The problem is that Rao is an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the DOJ. \nSpecifically, Rao is Supervisor of the Southern (※Greenbelt§) Division office for the DOJ＊s District of Maryland in Chevy Chase, Maryland. This means that Rao＊s district is virtually on top of the area in D.C. where Besta Pizza operates. In addition, Besta Pizza and two other associated properties are directly over abandoned underground tunnels, many of which could easily connect to Chevy Chase. \nOn top of his social and geographical proximity to Alefantis, Rao＊s DOJ division handles cases that seem tailor-made for busting〞or covering up〞the dark circles that sex traffickers hide in: federal racketeering, conspiracy, national and international fraud and corruption, immigration violations, counterfeiting, and 〞wait for it〞child pornography . \nIn closing I will leave you with three ※infographics.§ \nThey are very complicated and ※dense§ so I don＊t expect everyone to examine them. \nHowever, even if you don＊t look into the details yourself, I want you to be aware of how vast this whole network of evil is, and, therefore, of how many hands and prayers we need on deck to expose it and bring it down. \n(NOTE: You don＊t have to download these images to view them.

Moreover, she was observed nearly collapsing to the ground during a Sept. 11 memorial event in New York City. \nSpecifically, a video recorded from the event showed her propped up on a barrier, trying to remain upright as her security phalanx prepared to help her into her van. \nAs Clinton began walking toward the van, however, she began stumbling. Her campaign later first blamed this behavior on dehydration but subsequently attributed it to pneumonia . \nCombined, both the email revelations and the Democrat candidate＊s behavior have led many critics to speculate on her health, with some going so far as to claim that she suffers from Parkinson＊s disease or a similar ailment.

    "text": "Hillary Clinton＊s Exploits in McCarthyism November 8, 2016 \nThe New Cold Warriors who surround Hillary Clinton have made Russia-bashing and McCarthyism the go-to tactics to silence the few voices warning of the grave and unnecessary risks of a new Cold War, notes James W Carden. \nBy James W Carden \nNow that the 2016 election campaign is at long last over, an examination of the reckless, fact-free, innuendo-laden McCarthyite rhetoric which Hillary Clinton＊s campaign surrogates deployed over the past several months is in order. \nThe first and most obvious point to be made is that the anti-Russia hysteria that characterized the election, particularly in its final weeks, did not come out of nowhere; in fact, it should be seen as part of a natural progression of the elite media＊s Russophobia which took root in and around the Ukraine crisis of late 2013-early 2014 and led, almost ineffably, not only to charges of Russian election-rigging in the United States but in the identification, in the pages of Newsweek and the Washington Post , of Russian fifth-columns within the United States. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \nHow the Ukraine crisis poisoned America political discourse is by now well known. As I reported in The Nation almost 18 months ago, the cottage industry of unscrupulous neo-McCarthyites which has grown up around Washington, London and Manhattan in recent years has sought to stifle debate by bandying charges of unpatriotic disloyalty against anyone questioning the wisdom of U.S. policy toward Russia. (It bears noting that something similar regarding Syria policy is happening as I write, driven, for the most part, by the usual suspects.) \nAs one long time political scientist told me at the time, ※The atmosphere here in the U.S. created by the Ukraine crisis is poisonous 每 and I say this having been an academic for 37 years.§ \nThe millennial careerists who help staff the ranks of the New Cold Warriors instinctually reach for ad hominem attacks over reasoned argument 每 and in so doing helped make way for the tactics the Clinton campaign unleashed in 2016. \nBy the time the nominating conventions rolled around this summer, the Clinton campaign was engaged in a Twenty-first Century witch hunt against any Trump adviser who had so much as visited Russia. Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and foreign policy adviser Carter Page were both hounded out of the campaign by Clinton-inspired media smears. \nClinton＊s campaign, which was run by Robby Mook, a 36-year-old hot shot who clearly relished his role as a kind of millennial Roy Cohn, repeatedly attacked former Ambassador to Germany and arms control negotiator under Ronald Reagan, Richard Burt. \nBurt was singled out, not only by the Clinton camp, but by Salon and Newsweek, because he had served as an adviser to Alfa Bank, the Russian bank which played a starring role in former New Republic editor＊s Franklin Foer＊s thoroughly debunked article on the Trump Organization＊s (non-existent) ※secret§ email server. \nYet what is most interesting isn＊t so much the smears 每 phrases like ※useful idiot§ and ※Kremlin stooge§ which are mostly warmed-over fare from the first Cold War 每 but the mindset of the New Cold Warriors. How is it that these self-anointed crusaders for ※humanitarian intervention§ and ※democratization,§ these self-appointed enemies of tyranny, end up on the side of neo-Nazis in Ukraine, Al Qaeda and al-Nusra affiliate in Syria, all the while stirring up sectarian and nationalist pathologies across the Middle East and Eastern Europe? \nCold War Nostalgia \nThe first thing to recognize is that our New Cold Warriors suffer from la nostalgie de la guerre froide . The historian John Lukacs has written at length on this pathology. In his destined to be classic The End of The Twentieth Century, Lukacs cast a gimlet eye on what he saw as the tendency of academic and media types during the first Cold War to practice ※anti-Communism at a safe distance.§ Russian President Vladimir Putin answering questions from Russian citizens at his annual Q&A event on April 14, 2016. (Russian government photo) \nThis tendency, according to Lukacs, sprang from two sources: first, from a ※sense of self-satisfaction: knowing that one is on the right side, on the respectable side together with all of those right-thinking people.§ \nLukacs, himself no apologist for Communism, also observed that this tendency is driven by ※the exaggeration of the diabolical powers and machination of Communism and the Communists.§ Substitute ※Communism and the Communists§ for ※Putin and the Kremlin§ and you have a perfect precis of New Cold Warrior thinking. \nNo better example of this tendency to talk a tough game against post-Communist Russia by academics and journalists safe in the knowledge that they will never be called upon to fight, was a conference convened by Franklin Foer＊s New Republic in Kiev in May 2014. \nSome background may be in order: The Ukrainian crisis 每 involving the violent ouster of elected President Viktor Yanukovych on Feb. 22, 2014 每 escalated into a full-scale civil war in and around April 6 in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk. The Western-supported government in Kiev, depicting the indigenous anti-coup movement for a Russian invasion, sent its military and privately funded militias to crush the uprising in what was called an ※Anti-Terrorism Operation§ or ATO. \nTo some, it was a tragedy of the first order that Kiev chose war and missed an opportunity to earn 每 via negotiation and compromise 每 much needed legitimacy in the east for what was, after all, a junta government. \nYet others, like Yale University historian Timothy Snyder and the New Republic＊s literary editor Leon Wieseltier, embraced the ouster of Yanukovych and were positively exultant; so much so that they wasted little time in making their way to Kiev, ※rallying to democracy＊s side.§ \nThe conference, ※Ukraine: Thinking Together,§ featured several luminaries of the liberal-interventionist left including Franklin Foer; Iraq War apologist Paul Berman; National Endowment for Democracy President Carl Gershman; a founding father of Poland＊s Solidarity movement, Adam Michnik; a historian of Eastern Europe, Timothy Garton Ash; and the preening cheerleader of NATO＊s war on Libya, Bernard Henri Levy. \nIn a note announcing the conference, Wieseltier, sounding an awful lot like Christopher Hitchens in the run-up to the Iraq War, declared: ※We cannot just sit back and watch Putin＊s imperialism and repression. There are times and places where one must stand up and be counted.§ \nFrom where did this impulse to ※stand and up and be counted§ arise? Well, Wieseltier＊s remarks in Kiev are revealing and are worth quoting at length. In his rhetoric we can hear a not-so-faint echo of Edward Arlington Robinson＊s Miniver Cheevy: \n※I watched the progress of Putin＊s imperialism beyond his borders and fascism within his borders, I ruefully remarked to Frank Foer that the moment reminded me of what I used to call my Congress for Cultural Freedom-envy 〞 my somewhat facile but nonetheless sincere regret at having been born too late to participate in the struggle of Western intellectuals, some of whom became my teachers and my heroes, against the Stalinist assault on democracy in Europe. And all of a sudden, pondering the Russian aggression in Crimea, and the Russian campaign of destabilization in Ukraine, I realized that I had exaggerated my belatedness. I was not born too late at all.§ \nThat explains rather a lot. Wieseltier 每 and in all likelihood Levy and Foer 每 were suffering from a bad case of history-envy and saw in the crisis in Ukraine a chance to assuage their consciences and prove their worth on the world-historical stage. It is, it must be admitted, an odd way to go about it, socializing in Kiev with a Facebook billionaire , your friends and neocon fellow travelers from the magazine all the while homes, schools and hospitals in eastern Ukraine were being shelled to bits by the very government you traveled so far to ※ demonstrate solidarity § with. \nPutin Hatred \nIf Cold War nostalgia plays a role in shaping the weltanschauung of the New Cold Warriors, so too does their uncritical embrace of anyone who opposes Russian President Vladimir Putin. The New Cold Warriors are, in effect, blinded by pseudo-solidarity for Putin＊s ※victims§ like the crass performance artists Pussy Riot and the wondrously corrupt former oligarch-turned-sainted dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Screen shot of the fatal fire in Odessa, Ukraine, on May 2, 2014, that killed scores of ethnic Russians while Ukrainian nationalists cheered. (From RT video) \nAnd then, of course, there is the new Ukraine where the government, so enthusiastically embraced by Franklin Foer＊s New Republic, has embarked on program of de-Communization which, since Ukraine and Communism parted ways a quarter of a century ago, means, in practice, a program of de-Russification, with all that entails, including, a conscious erasure of the Soviet Union＊s role in defeating the Nazis and a whitewashing of Ukraine＊s ugly history of anti-Semitism, including the role of Stepan Bandera, the wartime leader of the nationalist OUN which was responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews and Poles. \nAs the magazine The Forward reported: ※The whitewashing, now a disturbingly widespread phenomenon, ramped up in earnest after Ukraine＊s 2013每2014 Maidan uprising and the ensuing conflict with Russia. On January 1, 2014, 15,000 ultra-nationalists marched through Kiev carrying placards with [Ukrainian nationalist Stepan] Bandera＊s image and chanting OUN slogans; today, marches honoring Bandera, the OUN and Ukrainian SS units take place regularly across Ukraine. \n※In the spring of 2015, Ukraine＊s parliament passed a highly controversial law , mandating that Bandera and his groups be regarded as Ukrainian patriots, and making denial of their heroism a criminal offense.§ \nIn a way, these developments were probably a long time in coming and have been facilitated by the effective disenfranchisement of a large share of the Russo-phone east. Consider the spike in nationalist sentiment in Eastern Europe in the post-Cold War years. \nWe return briefly to the historian Lukacs who observed in 1993 ※a growing nostalgia and appreciation of nationalist Eastern European governments before and during the Second World War.§ He observed that in the years following the fall of the Berlin Wall, ※schools and streets§ in Slovakia and Croatia were being renamed in honor of Nazi collaborators, while in Romania ※the murderous Iron Cross now enjoys a recurrent wave of nostalgic prestige.§ \nThe American media has willfully turned a blind eye to these similar and ominous developments in Ukraine (to say nothing of the recent torchlight parades in NATO-allied Estonia ) because what matters among the New Cold Warriors is to appear to be ※taking a stand§ against the Russian bogeyman. \nIgnoring Reality \nAnd then there is the inability or unwillingness of the New Cold Warriors to take realpolitik considerations into account when it comes to Russia. This is odd, since they are as of one mind when it comes to far more sinister regimes like Saudi Arabia, where people quite literally have their heads chopped off in the middle of the street in broad daylight. Nazi symbols on helmets worn by members of Ukraine＊s Azov battalion. (As filmed by a Norwegian film crew and shown on German TV) \nBut, they will say, the U.S. needs Saudi Arabia because a) they have oil and b) they oppose the Iranians. As arch-neoconservative Bret Stephens recently said in an exchange with Sen. Rand Paul on MSNBC＊s ※Morning Joe,§ we are ※lucky§ to have the Saudis as allies. \nLeave that nonsense aside for the moment: the point is that the facility to think in terms of geo-strategy abandons the New Cold Warriors when it comes to Russia and Vladimir Putin. And so, the fact that Russia does not threaten American interests in our hemisphere; that it did more than most NATO allies to assist in the fight in Afghanistan (via the Northern Distribution Network); that it was a crucial player in the Iranian P5+1 negotiations (which the New Cold Warriors probably hold against the Russians, since they are nearly all opposed to the deal); and that it brokered the deal to dismantle Bashar al-Assad＊s chemical weapons program in Syria are all studiously ignored in their analyses. \nIn other words, panic and handwringing over the alleged ※cyber war§ aside, Putin＊s Russia does not threaten U.S. interests, properly defined. Indeed, Russia has, whether we find its domestic politics and widespread government corruption distasteful or not (and I do), proved to be an important partner when its core interests coincide with ours 每 which is more often than not. \nInterests should drive policy not ephemeral, so-called ※shared values§ to which the New Cold Warriors themselves only fitfully adhere . \nTwenty-five years ago, one U.S. president sketched out an alternative path to the one that the U.S. has been pursuing since Bill Clinton took office. In a speech much derided by those who practiced ※anti-Communism at a safe distance,§ President George H.W. Bush traveled to Kiev on Aug. 1, 1991, to warn against succumbing to the siren song of ethno-nationalism. \n※Freedom, democracy, and economic liberty,§ said Bush , ※No terms have been abused more regularly, nor more cynically than these. Throughout this century despots have masqueraded as democrats, jailers have posed as liberators.§ He continued in a vein almost unthinkable by an American president today: ※Americans will not support those who seek independence in order to replace a far-off tyranny with a local despotism. They will not aid those who promote a suicidal nationalism based upon ethnic hatred.§ \nBush was prescient: the steady diet of Russophobia and anti-Putin hysteria now underway (and de rigueur among the New Cold Warriors) is fanning the flames of ethno-nationalist hatred within Europe. Does this development enhance or detract from pan-European stability and U.S. national security? \nThe answer is clear. And yet the new crusaders persist, and worryingly, as of Tuesday, may have a commander-in-chief who completely shares their views waiting in the wings. \nJames W Carden is a contributing writer for The Nation and editor of The American Committee for East-West Accord＊s eastwestaccord.com.

    "title": "Stopping Hillary＊s Coming War on Syria",
    "text": "Email \nWith Hillary Clinton＊s victory in the bag, there＊s a growing fear that her presidency will begin with a bang: regime change in Syria. Clinton has said as much. Last year Reuters reported that ※removing President Assad§ would be Clinton＊s ※top priority.§ \nThis regime change sentiment was echoed more recently by her foreign policy adviser, Jeremy Bash, who said that Clinton would ※＃work to get Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, ※out of there.§ \nMore spectacularly has been Clinton＊s repeated insistence during debates that a ※no fly zone§ should be implemented in Syria, which, as the Libyan experiment proved, is a euphemism for regime change and war. \nThe fact that such blatant warmongering can go unchallenged is itself a major PR victory for the establishment. The anti-war movement seems speechless, immobile in the face of yet another war. \nThis paralysis is due, in part, to the Left＊s splintering over Syria, where vicious infighting over a consistent anti-war perspective has spoiled debate. \nInstead of focusing on stopping the next war, the Left continues to bicker about who deserves the most blame for the Syrian catastrophe. As a result, working people are left in the dark about the U.S. role in the Syrian war. They don＊t know the U.S. has been leading a proxy war against the Syrian government, and they are unprepared for the full-scale military intervention that remains a real possibility. \nThe vast educational void around Syria is being filled, in part, by mainstream politicians, such as moderate Congressional Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, who sounds ※radical§ when she recently wrote in an online petition: \n§The war to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad is creating more devastation, human suffering, and refugees＃Have we learned nothing from Iraq and Libya? We must end our [U.S.] war to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad now.§ \nIf only most Left groups spoke as clearly as Gabbard about Syria, whose petition is only radical because the Left has so thoroughly minimized the U.S. role in funding, arming, training, and coordinating the proxy war against the Syrian government. \nA key mistake some Left groups make is focusing their anti-war actions on ※all sides,§ wrongly believing that this alone is an internationalist approach against imperialism and war. But a critical component gets ignored when this principle is clung to. \nStopping the U.S. war on Syria requires that U.S. activists actively educate and focus on the U.S. role, so that people can be agitated into action and mobilized by the tens of thousands. The principled ※pox on both houses§ approach leads, in practice, to inaction, making it an empty phrase when what is needed is a concrete strategy for effective on the ground organizing. \nThe essence of a revolutionary, internationalist approach to anti-war strategy was summarized by Leon Trotsky, when he said ※In the struggle against imperialism and war the basic principle is: ＆the chief enemy is in your own country.＊§ \nThe quote is a guide to action for those living in imperialist countries, and the U.S. remains the world＊s foremost imperialist country. Syria is not an imperialist country. \nThe focus, therefore, for U.S. anti-war activists should be on the U.S.＊ actions abroad in order to mobilize to stop it. An internationalist approach is working to minimize the harm that your imperialist country can do to the working class abroad. \nAll anti-war organizers should base their actions on this premise, since this truism allows for the most effective anti-war strategy when put into practice. Straying from this principle can get you into serious trouble. \nIt＊s in your own country where you actually organize people on the ground, where they can be educated and mobilized directly against the government to apply direct pressure. \nWriting the occasional anti-war article that analyzes the various bad actors is fine, but when it comes to the realm of action and organizing, focus is required. You cannot organize effectively against all sides. Your efforts must be prioritized where you can have the most impact, and where your efforts cannot be co-opted by your government as war propaganda. \nYour own government is the enemy because its foreign policy is dictated by the same U.S. corporations that exercise power domestically, who exploit workers in the U.S., who don＊t pay taxes in the U.S., and who fund anti-worker legislation domestically. \nSome of these same corporations want raw materials, contracts, and new markets abroad, and will bomb the world to smithereens to get it. The fight against war always starts at home. \nAs Fred Halstead wrote in the groundbreaking work ※Out Now,§ the anti-Vietnam war movement was strong when it focused on educating and mobilizing U.S. society, from students, veterans, union members, etc., while also directly agitating U.S. troops stationed in Vietnam, who were emboldened by the mass rallies they saw at home. When U.S. soldiers began organizing against their officers by refusing to fight, the war could no longer continue. The excellent documentary ※Sir No Sir§ shows the power of organizing active duty military personnel. \nThe anti-Vietnam war movement didn＊t focus on the violence of the North Vietnamese, or the role played by China and the U.S.S.R., they focused on the role played by the U.S., and because of this they were able to effectively educate and mobilize hundreds of thousands of people, stop the war, and effect a cultural change in the U.S. where for decades it was politically impossible to enact direct military intervention. \nA similar approach was used by the Russian revolutionaries in World War I, where a massive anti-war movement was created, not by agitating against the Germans 〞 who were arguably the aggressors 〞 but by focusing first on the Czar of Russia, and then on the Russian capitalists who wanted to continue the war after the Czar＊s downfall. The mobilization for ※peace§ grew to be one of the pillar demands of the successful revolution. \nU.S. Left groups needn＊t focus on the ※evils§ of Russia or the Syrian government; huge resources are already spent on this by multi-billion-dollar media conglomerates. Demonizing the enemy of U.S. imperialism doesn＊t help U.S. workers in terms of mobilizing to stop the war. In fact, demonizing ※the enemy§ helps keep workers passive, since it makes the war appear ※moral.§ \nA good example of this grave mistake comes from the International Socialist Organization (ISO), whose recent article criticizes the new antiwar coalition ＆Hands Off Syria.§ The article reads: \n※U.S. Hands Off Syria is exclusively focused on opposing U.S. military intervention and what it claims is Washington＊s determination to achieve regime change in Syria. But this means the coalition and those who endorse it ignore the main source of the barbaric violence and repression in Syria today: the Assad government, its allies within the region and the Russian empire that backs Assad to the hilt＃.§ \nHands Off Syria keeps true to the antiwar maxim ※the chief enemy is in your own country,§ and the ISO ridicules them for it. \nThe same article goes on to slander Hands Off Syria by accusing them of ※＃supporting a dictator like Assad and an imperialist power like Vladimir Putin＊s Russia.§ This ※pro-Assad§ slander has been aimed at anyone 〞 this writer included 〞 who focuses their fire on the U.S. involvement in the Syrian conflict. The smear campaign has ruined the discussion around Syria, helping to mis-educate people who might otherwise be organized into action. \nThe ISO fails to mention in its article that Hands Off Syria specifically mentions that ※It is not our business to support or oppose President Assad or the Syrian government. Only the Syrian people have the right to decide the legitimacy of their government.§ \nThe ISO calls Hands Off Syria ※pro-Assad§ because the group says, correctly, that Syria has the right to self-determination. In a nutshell ※self-determination§ means that non-imperialist countries, like Syria, have a right not to be interfered with by imperialist countries, such as the United States. \nAll revolutionaries have a duty to uphold this core tenant of anti-imperialism. Watering this principle down 〞 because ※Assad is a brutal dictator§ 〞 is another example of undercutting both theory and action around anti-war work. \nThe main demands of the Hands Off Syria coalition are completely supportable from an internationalist, socialist perspective, and deserve mention, since they went unmentioned in the ISO article that attacked them: \n1 An immediate end to the U.S. policy of forced regime change in Syria and full recognition and compliance by the U.S., NATO and their allies with principles of international law and the U.N. Charter, including respect for the independence and territorial integrity of Syria. \n2 An immediate end to all foreign aggression against Syria, and serious efforts toward a political resolution to the war. \n3 An immediate end to all military, financial, logistical and intelligence support by the U.S., NATO and their regional allies to all foreign mercenaries and extremists in the Middle East region. \n4 An immediate end to economic sanctions against Syria. Massive international aid for displaced people within Syria and Syrian refugees abroad. \nHands of Syria is a united front coalition that should have existed for several years; its late arrival is due to the gutter-level Syria debate among Left groups. So attacking this big step forward in anti-war work only detracts from the anti-war movement, and thus empowers the U.S. government to act with a freer hand in Syria. \nA consistent antiwar approach means combining theory with action, going beyond intellectual exercises and into organizing. If an antiwar theory equals inaction in the face of war, that perspective is exposed as moribund, lifeless. An antiwar approach must have practical applications to movement politics, a way to connect with and mobilize the masses. \nBlaming ※all sides§ has the unintended consequences of pacifying working people in the face of war, since the kind education that might agitate them into action 〞 their own government＊s actions 〞 is being either minimized or crowded out by nonstop comparisons with the ※worse§ actions of other governments (those in the cross-hairs of U.S. imperialism). \nTo put anti-war work into practice, every effort must be made to explain the history of the U.S. intervention in Syria, and how this intervention continues today, and how the logic of this intervention inevitably leads to a full scale military confrontation, as very nearly happened in 2013 when Obama backed down from attacking the Syrian government. \nA revolutionary approach to war lies in exposing the lies of the capitalist media and politicians, so that workers understand the propaganda that is leading them into war, so they can be prepared to mobilize against it when war breaks out. Anything less is an academic exercise, divorced from the realities of the class struggle in the U.S. \nMost conflicts have several precipitating factors, so ascribing blame to who fired the first shot or who was the ※most savage§ cannot be a guiding force in anti-war work. It serves mainly to distract, to disorient. By focusing on Russia and Syria, the U.S. war propaganda goes unchallenged, and thus can maintain a powerful stultifying force on working people in the face of war. \nAny mass movement for peace wields revolutionary implications. Especially in the U.S., whose global empire of military bases acts as a stifling conservative political force across the globe, while the domestic politics have been stifled by this same ※military industrial complex.§ This behemoth of concentrated power will require an equal power to demobilize it, and that power can only be the working class mobilized. \nAny effective anti-war work must stay true to the basic principles elaborated by Trotsky decades ago: \n※The transformation of imperialist war into civil [class] war is that general strategic task to which the whole work of a proletarian party during war should be subordinated.§ \nThe enemy remains at home.",

    "title": "The Hillary Era is Coming: Worry!",
    "text": "Photo by Veni | CC BY 2.0 \nI trust that I am not the only one to have noticed that in rural areas and economically distressed neighborhoods in towns and cities, lawn signs for Donald Trump are everywhere, while Hillary signs are rarer than Teslas and Maseratis. \nI think I understand the Trump signs: they are cries of defiance. \nHillary＊s supporters are harder to figure out. I suspect that most of them would just as soon not advertise their intentions November 8. Even if they think that there is no other way to stop Trump, they understand that, by voting for Hillary, they are embarrassing themselves. \nLawn signs apart, the evidence that Trump is kaput is, by now, overwhelming. He seems finally to have done his campaign in 每 to such an extent that even diehard anti-Trump fear mongers concede the inevitability of the Clintons＊ return to the White House. \nTrump＊s campaign had been on life support for weeks when the pussy grabbing tape surfaced, followed by a seemingly endless stream of women 每 a dozen or so already 〞 accusing the Donald of groping them and worse. \nThen, in the third debate, Trump announced that he would ※wait and see§ before accepting the legitimacy of a Clinton victory. This seems to have been the final straw for all but the most bona fide ※deplorables.§ \nAnd so, the writing is on the wall: Hillary will win just as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow 每 well, not quite, but almost. \nThere is no reason to rejoice in her victory, only in Trump＊s defeat. \nAnd even that isn＊t as obvious as it seems . Hillary probably the lesser evil all things considered. But Trump is very likely the less dangerous of the two. \nThe man is an adolescent in a septuagenarian＊s body, with a tendency to act out. But at least he is not a Russophobe or a neocon or a ※humanitarian§ intervener intent on regime change in countries that resist American domination. \nThis would include not only the usual victims, countries incapable of harming the United States militarily, but Russia and China as well. \nIt is relevant too that the supposed lesser evil is a committed neoliberal and a Wall Street toady, and that Trump＊s ※crooked Hillary§ taunts hit the target more often than not. \nThese considerations, and others like them, should cause concern to those who are fine with lesser evil voting in general, but who think that there are thresholds beneath which lesser evil considerations should not apply. \nThere is no need to agonize over these issues, however; not in this case. When Trump became the Republican nominee, lesser evil arguments became moot. \nThis would still be the case even if more voters were not quite so willfully blind to the dangers inherent in Clinton＊s determination to maintain American world domination by any means necessary, and to her fondness for military ※solutions.§ \nLesser evil considerations are irrelevant because Trump is and always has been bound to lose to any Democrat, even to her. \nI have been pressing this point and its corollary 〞 that anti-Trump hysteria is a distraction 每 from Day One. As recently as a month ago, hardly anyone agreed with me. \nIf only I had a dollar for every time I have been taken to task for not seeing the parallels between the Trump phenomenon and the rise of Nazism in the final years of the Weimar Republic! I would be a rich man today. \nBut because it is now recognized that Trump＊s chances of becoming President are, for all practical purposes, nil, no one is pressing that line these days. I used to be out on a limb; I no longer am. \nIt would be only natural to take pleasure in this turn of events, and I would 〞 but for the fact that a Trump defeat implies a Clinton victory. That prospect is, at best, only slightly less nightmarish. \nWorse, it doesn＊t seem to matter that all but the most flagrant worrywarts now finally concede that there will never be a President Trump. Liberals and centrists and even a few foolish leftists are still going all out for Hillary. \nFrom the dead center to the soft left, the consensus view is still that now is a time to boost, not knock, Hillary＊s campaign 〞 especially in the dozen or so states where the Electoral College outcomes could not have been determined years ago with absolute certainty. \nIt is remarkable that so many people cannot let anti-Trump hysteria go; that they are so focused on Trump＊s misogyny, temperamental instability, and narcissistic blather that they don＊t see that the only thing we need fear, where Trump is concerned, is, so to speak, the fear itself. \nHowever, in Hillary＊s case, there really is something to fear: that she is about to become the Commander-in-Chief of the most lethal military force in the history of the world. \nOn that point, her supporters are in denial, and even people who know better than to support her for her own sake remain determined to waste their votes by adding to her totals. Apparently, they think that this is a way to send the message that Trumpian ※fascism§ shall not pass. \nHow much better it would be if they would use their votes to build alternatives to the neoliberal perpetual war regime that Hillary and Bill and their co-thinkers have helped fashion! \nThe best chance for that, at this point, is Jill Stein＊s campaign on the Green Party ticket. \nStein cannot win, of course; a vote for her is only a protest vote. But there is nothing wrong with that. Hillary needs to know that she has no mandate to end the world ※as we know it,§ and this is one of many ways to convey that message. \nPundits who claim otherwise are dead wrong. Those who pile on for Hillary are wasting their votes; protest votes aimed at Hillary are not wasted at all. \nI would imagine that at least some Trump voters are thinking along similar lines. But the racism, nativism and Islamophobia of their candidate tarnishes the messages their votes will convey. They therefore cannot register with any real clarity. \nThe message protest votes for Stein convey is, on the other hand, as clear and distinct as can be. \nAnd if she garners at least five percent of the total votes cast, the Greens will have access to federal funding in future elections, and will have a much easier time gaining ballot access in all fifty states. \nThis would not make for much of a ※political revolution,§ even in Bernie Sanders＊ highly attenuated sense of the term, but it would make future elections less mind-numbing and degrading, and it could ultimately lead to more far-reaching transformations of the political scene. \nNow that Trump has all but killed off the GOP, the duopoly party system is in jeopardy, and all kinds of political realignments have, at last, become feasible. *** \nI wasn＊t just being contrarian when I went out on a limb about Trump＊s chances; and my confidence was in no way based on inferences from polling data or statistical extrapolations. \nLet the blogosphere＊s ※political junkies§ and the corporate media＊s talking heads knock themselves out with that. What they do is useful only for entertaining people who care about the horse race aspect of presidential elections. It is distressing how many Americans indulge in that spectator sport. Most of them are essentially apolitical. \nI was confident that I was right about Trump＊s chances because I knew that what people tell pollsters when an election seems far off is basically irrelevant for predicting the election＊s outcome. Information about how they and people like them voted in the past is more relevant, but not by much. \nThis is especially true when, as in this case, disdain for one or the other candidate, or for both, is a dispositive factor in many voters＊ minds. \nI was also fairly sure that, rightly or wrongly, more people fear and loathe Trump than fear and loathe Hillary; and that, if they didn＊t at the outset, they would before long 每 because Trump was all but certain to undermine himself, and because there is so much dirt out there on the Donald＊s sleazy connections and moral turpitude that even God-fearing Republicans, capable of believing almost any nonsense, were bound eventually to be repulsed. \nI suspected too that Trump never really wanted to be President; that he only got into the race to promote his brand, and because he is an egotist and publicity-hound. \nTrump hates to lose, however 〞 especially to the likes of Hillary 〞 and so, at some point, he must have decided to give the campaign his all, even if it meant bringing the Trump brand down with him. \nShould it come to that, I will shed crocodile tears for his brood, Ivanka especially. A worthwhile thing to do in the months ahead would be to work to make that happen; to do everything possible to assure that the damage done to all things Trump will be irreversible. What a delightful irony that would be! \nThere are plenty of Hillary-haters in the Donald＊s base who hate Hillary because they consider her the embodiment of coercive goody-goodyism, or because they think she is disdainful of people like them (people in the ※deplorables§ demographic), or because they think that she is too leftwing. \nThe idea that she is too leftwing is nonsense, of course; she is not nearly leftwing enough. That anyone would think otherwise is a testament to the media＊s ability to shape public perceptions and to the degree of political ignorance rampant in some quarters of the American electorate. \nBut ※vast rightwing conspiracy§ Hillary-haters are spot on right about the rest of it 〞 and two out of three isn＊t bad. \nEven so, there are better reasons than theirs to dread the prospect of a Clinton presidency. They all have to do with the service Hillary has done, and will go on doing, for the miscreants who control the commanding heights of America＊s and the world＊s capitalist order, and with her untrammeled, ideologically-driven bellicosity. \nHillary knows how to game the system; and she and Bill know how to benefit from doing so. But, for all her vaunted ※experience,§ she is clueless about the world. And although she and her fans boast of her ※pragmatism,§ that woman is seriously inept. \nMost of what she undertakes to do is ill conceived, and nearly all of it turns out badly. \nIn short, the lesser evil, if that is what she is, is a very great evil indeed. \nIt won＊t take long, once she moves back into the White House and starts putting her stamp on the empire＊s depredations, for the scales to fall from the eyes of all but her most gullible supporters. \nI am even more sure of this than I was of Trump＊s defeat, but I will take even less joy in being proved right again. What lies ahead, with Hillary in control, is too horrible to contemplate.

    "title": "Hillary, Trump and Sartre: How Existentialism Disrobes the Major Presidential Candidates",
    "text": "Email \nIn the US, the political system has now disgorged two candidates the citizenry cannot be less enthusiastic about. Driven by ambition more than a love of the people or a sincere desire to serve, one can be forgiven for wondering if they are just as trapped by their motivations as the public in its two-party myopia. No authentic leader among the two ＃ \nThese thoughts lead to the rage of my youth, existentialism, and to Jean-Paul Sartre, who died 36 years ago last April. More than 50,000 mourners lined the streets and packed Montparnasse cemetery at his funeral, many quite young 〞 improbable they would exhibit a similar interest in the successor philosophies, notably the current preoccupation with deconstruction, a focus on whether the written or spoken word is successful (or not) in clarity of meaning. \nDifficult as existentialism may be to pin down, there are a few necessary elements: the individual, free will as crucial to human existence, the subsequent responsibility for action that accompanies it, leading to an unavoidable anxiety as a consequence. The authentic life then is one chosen freely rather than imposed by society. No wonder it appealed to the young. \nWhat triggered this meandering into Sartre and his philosophy was Hillary Clinton＊s two-minute summing up at the end of the last debate. She attested to her lifelong concern (her latest claim) for improving the lives of children 〞 a phrase bringing to mind a balancing scale. One one side the improved lives of children in Arkansas and the benefits of subsidies to children in general, and on the other the deaths of hundreds of thousands in Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere 〞 the most vulnerable that is the old, the sick and the children bearing the brunt. Politicians are a breed apart, unconcerned with ＆responsibility＊ and undisturbed by Sartre＊s ＆anxiety＊. \nNot so long ago there was another US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, who, when asked about the 576,000 children who had died (according to a UN report) as a result of the Iraq embargo, simply dismissed the question as a price to be paid to be rid of Saddam Hussein. The embargo failed in that regard, and when Saddam was removed by the successor US government＊s military intervention, it resulted in chaos and the birth of ISIS. \nThe Republican candidate, Donald Trump, is unique, in that responsibility washes over him and into the shower drain like a layer of dirt; he is devoid of it even in personal interaction. The only rational explanation of his behavior is the term ＆prolonged adolescence＊ used by professionals. \nHis basic issue over several decades has been bad deals 〞 bad deals in defending allies who he feels do not pay enough for their defense and bad trade deals. Trying to peel off some voters, Hillary Clinton in the last debate pointed out that he took out an ad in The New York Times opposing the right＊s iconic Ronald Reagan over it. Like any business owner or high level executive, he intends to issue orders expecting them to be carried out. Good luck! It might explain the absence of concrete policy. \nThe American public has been short changed into picking either the lesser of two evils, casting a protest vote with the minor left or right party, or just sitting this election out. \nSartre offered personal bliss in the few post-war years of hope and promise before America＊s fear of ideologies and overweening sense of power plunged us into successive wars punctuated with interludes of peace. The wars continue, bleeding the country of an estimated $5 trillion in the present cycle ＃ the death and destruction the worst since the Second World War.",

    "text": "Email \nElections in the United States are far and away the most expensive in the entire world. In 2012, the Federal Election Commission reported that $7 billion was spent on the presidential campaign. By the time the ink is dry on the 2016 election, the number will likely be even higher. American voters take for granted that political campaigns provide value that allows them to choose the candidate that best represents their ideology and policy positions. But, is this really the best system? Is it even a good one? \nThe astronomical cost of campaigns in the U.S. prohibits all but a small handful of individuals with the celebrity and access to obscene sums money the realistic opportunity to compete. It should be no surprise that the two finalists for president in 2016 are both multi-millionaire oligarchs. Even so, they are dependent on raising hundreds of millions of dollars from big business and other special interests. \nIs it reasonable to expect that after such a process the winner of the election will be able to represent the interests of the average citizen rather than the super-wealthy elite individuals and corporations whose patronage allowed them achieve victory at the polls? \nA recent Princeton University academic study disputes this notion. Martin Giles and Benjamin Page write that statistical measures demonstrate that elites and business interests have an impact on policy directly correlated to their wealth, while the average voter has no discernible impact on policy at all. The influence of regular citizens is so low, the authors argue, that it would be inaccurate to characterize the American political system as a democracy. \nAs greater economic power necessarily translates to greater political power, a reasonable remedy to the situation would be to decrease inequality in the United States. If inequality was drastically rolled back to a level closer to that found after the end of WWII 每 through massive taxes on wealth, income and capital gains, along with the abolition of inheritance 每 perhaps the conditions would exist for fair elections based on competitive campaigns. \nBut absent such a drastic realignment of the politico-economic system, are there better possibilities for American citizens to elect officials that represent their interests? The nation has seen that Barack Obama＊s promises in 2008 to represent ※hope and change,§ to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, close Guantanamo, operate transparently, limit domestic surveillance and reform taxes were, in reality, little more than hot air. \nWhat if instead of being allowed to create his own narrative, a summary of his undistinguished record as an lawyer from elite universities and corporate-friendly record state representative and politician was what voters had to guide their expectations of how he would govern? \nPerhaps the U.S. could look to Cuba, where the Revolutionary government 每 facing unrelenting subversion and destabilization for decades by its imperial neighbor to the north 每 has managed to eliminate money from politics entirely. At the municipal level, candidates spend no money and do not campaign at all. Instead, voters are presented with short biographies to reference in determining who they believe would better represent them. \nAs the U.S. prepares for its latest electoral spectacle in a few weeks, I offer sample bios for the two presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, based on what they may look like if they were running for office in Cuba . ***",

    "text": "Given the shameless, over-the-top, almost breathtakingly cloying pro-Hillary promotional hype that Michael Moore has been spouting recently (roughly, since mid-July), the only explanation is that this man〞this pride of Flint, Michigan, this modest film documentarian who grew up middle-class but is now worth upwards of $50 million〞secretly harbors a desire to play a role in a Hillary Clinton administration.\nIf not a Cabinet post, then something else. It＊s more likely he has his eye on an ambassadorship. Maybe he covets being posted in a fun country, preferably a ※resort country,§ a country with a temperate climate and friendly people, a country where they speak English and don＊t get all carried with civil unrest. The Honorable Michael Francis Moore, U.S. Ambassador to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. You have to admit, it has a nice ring to it.\nDon＊t laugh. How do you think people get these ambassadorships? It＊s never been about anything having to do with ※qualifications.§ Ambassadorships are handed out in return for loyal service, in return for an important political favor, in return for keeping a potential troublemaker quiet, and in return for helping to raise a shit-pot of campaign donations. It＊s ※quid pro quo§ writ large.\nOf course, when it comes to countries that might actually require a modicum of diplomatic ability, the administration has to be careful. You can＊t just take someone off the street and make them ambassador to a place like Russia or China or Brazil, not if the U.S. wishes to maintain its credibility. But still, there are plenty of places in the world where you can pretty much dump anybody.\nTake President Clinton＊s administration, for example. In 1994, Bill Clinton rewarded congresswoman Maxine Waters for her long-time support, along with her role in securing African-American votes, by appointing her husband, Sidney Williams, to the post of U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas. Prior to becoming an ambassador, Williams played football in the NFL, and ran a Cadillac dealership in Los Angeles. Life in Nassau was good.\nAgain: ※Michael Francis Moore: U.S. Ambassador to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas§ has a nice ring to it. If not the Bahamas, then how about Barbados? There＊s whole array of places to pick from. Granted, picturing Moore in a silk top hat and coattails instead of his usual baseball cap and sweatshirt is a bit of a stretch, but with a little coaching, there＊s no doubt he can pull it off. After all, isn＊t that why people in these positions have ※personal assistants§?\nSo best of luck to you, Michael. Let＊s hope that when you or your ※people§ casually mention to Hillary that being an ambassador would be a cool job, she gets the hint. On the other hand, don＊t count your chickens before they hatch (to coin a phrase). Because this is big-time politics, there will be a long list of people seeking the same job. Debbie Wasserman and Donna Brazile immediately come to mind.\n David Macaray is a playwright and author.

    "text": "All is fair in love and war, and this particular electoral battle in US politics has assumed more belligerent proportions than most. Neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton genuinely deserve to be in the White House, but elections are rarely fought, let alone won, on the issue of the deserving.\nAs the election moves into it＊s the cracker phase, Trump is scrapping his way back in the polls, ever the immeasurable factor in this election. For the establishment, the battle is already won, creating a dangerous sense of entitlement for the Democratic nominee.\nThat sense of entitlement shone through in the latest fury from the Clinton campaign, nervous about the FBI＊s foray into the last days of this election. As ever, it was that seedy matter of emails sent on a private server when she was Secretary of State that came bobbing back up.\nOn Friday, Director James B. Comey sent a letter to the US Congress noting that he was wishing, due to ※recent developments§ to ※supplement§ previous testimony on the previous and closed investigation into Clinton＊s use of a private server. ※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.§ [1]\nThat unrelated case involved emails discovered on the laptop of disgraced former congressman Anthony D. Weiner, and a Clinton aide and Weiner＊s estranged wife, Huma Abedin. Clinton found herself back in the frame.\nImaginations started to gallop, notably at the open nature of the remarks. The investigation would involve the old issue of whether classified information had been involved, and whether relevant emails would be pertinent to the investigation.\nNo sense of scope, length or frame of the investigation was given: ※Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.§\nPreviously, Comey railroaded efforts to bring charges against Clinton＊s misuse of classified material despite noting ※evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of information.§ In so doing, he did acknowledge that prosecutors ponder a ※number of factors before bringing charges.§ These include ※the context of a person＊s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past§ and ※the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent.§\nWhile his then recommendation for non-prosecution was hardly binding on the Attorney-General, it would have been irregular to expect a prosecution in absence of hearty approval from the FBI. The result, or so thought those manning the barricades of the Clinton campaign, was permitted to rest.\nThis naturally unleashed a hailstorm of speculation from such figures as Rush Limbaugh, who pondered whether there had been an element of connivance between the Obama administration, Comey and Clinton. Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch saw ※a disconnect between Comey＊s devastating findings and his weak recommendation not to prosecute Hillary Clinton.§ [2]\nThis ※disconnect§ has been a feature of the entire discussion about Email Gate. For one, President Barack Obama, despite being an enthusiast for prosecuting whistleblowers who disclose classified information for a perceived higher ideal for information transparency, did not see a legal problem with Clinton＊s use of a personal email server.\nIt was ※not a situation in which America＊s national security was endangered§ even if it was imprudent. [3] Rather confidently, and in a manner befitting premature judgement, Obama insisted in April this year that Clinton ※would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy.§\nCertain outlets of legal commentary, notably Lawfare , have taken note about the entire background surrounding Comey＊s moves as murky and compromising for a range of parties. Attorney-General Loretta Lynch, for one, had been compromised by the President＊s certitude on the subject of Clinton＊s behaviour, a point made even more complicated by a promise 每 albeit one made by Clinton 每 that Lynch would continue to remain AG in her administration. [4]\nIn then testifying before Congress about his own decision not to prosecute, an investigation was essentially being given dramatic air time. Truly, we were bearing witness to another Clinton saga, the legal equivalent of constipation in an ailing Republic. ※As a general matter,§ lamented Benjamin Wittes of the Brookings Institution, ※when prosecutors and investigators decline to indict someone, we don＊t want a report, much less congressional oversight of the unindicted conduct. We want them to shut the heck up.§ [5]\nThere was, however, no shutting up Comey, who is making more electoral history than is customary for a law enforcement organisation. It baffled Clinton, who has persistently wished the email matter to disappear in a confusing haze. Nor did Comey listen to senior Justice Department officials, who attempted to dissuade the move to send the letter. [6] ※Never in recent history,§ claimed the New York Times , ※has the FBI been so enmeshed in a presidential race.§ [7]\nThe FBI director＊s intervention has already inflicted range of shocks, though it is imprecise to what extent his own announcement will alter set minds or convince the confused. Trump, most certainly, was emboldened, and the unpopularity contest is set for a few more hiccups prior to the November 8 poll.\nNotes.\n[1] http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/28/us/politics/fbi-letter.html?_r=0\n[2] http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/07/05/republicans-and-conservatives-assail-fbis-decision-not-to-indict-hillary-clinton/\n[3] http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/us/politics/obama-tells-60-minutes-hillary-clinton-made-email-mistake.html\n[4] https://www.lawfareblog.com/james-comey-hillary-clinton-and-email-investigation-guide-perplexed\n[5] https://www.lawfareblog.com/comeys-testimony-precedent\n[6] http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/us/politics/comey-clinton-email-justice.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news\n[7] http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-emails.html\n Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.

Share on : Tua Pui Poh \nYes. Finally, America can be GREAT AGAIN under TRUMP who would trump, triumph and fires those unfit to represent the silent majority people in America! I can be proud of America once again all the way from Belgium!",

    "text": "Listen up everybody \nIt is literally less than two weeks till the election. \n@Colonel-Gunter.Brumm has had a brilliant idea. For the remainder of the race we need to focus on one last Glorious Memetic Campaign. It should primarily be focused on social media for widest distribution. \nSpecifically via a ＆NORMIE FRIENDLY＊ assault. \nOur Orders: Add a shortcut to this article to your desktop. Check the BBS for great posts and send them out across your networks. Make a new folder on your desktop just for this campaign. Archive, create, distribute Go through ALL of your archives for the best memes you have. ONLY NORMIE FRIENDLY stuff. Anti Hillary and Glorious Trump stuff. NO Hakenkreuzes, chicken and watermelons or Daily Stormer watermarks, etc. Then assemble them all along with PNGs, blank backgrounds, finished products, etc so that we can mobilze and go full Klendathu Drop on her ass for the rest of the campaign. Because this is the ONLY TIME THAT COUNTS FOR MOST SHEEPLE. We need to reach the sheeple that we all? know personally and get them laughing, angry, emoting, etc. Deploy these normie friendly memes to flood your own personal social media, twitter etc. Put them into the hands of all of your colleagues at work, friends, relatives and their friends to flood the planet for the next 2 weeks. Again- NO Nazi stuff, just intense anti Hillary stuff right up to the edge of what we normally do and our best of the best Trump stuff we have. Make many posts, every day for the rest of the presidential campaign. Saturate all your networks (i.e. FB, Twitter etc.) Deploy all your accounts, IRLs, sockpuppets, etc. Reach out to other Alt-Right communities and have them join us. \nCheck back here on this article every day to get more ammo and to leave more for others. \nAnyone that blocks you is a Hillary voter so don＊t worry about them. Anyone that＊s pro Trump will not block you and will share your stuff. Anyone undecided will read and can be swayed by the humor and horror and beauty of our memes. \nRemember this is about reaching the undecided, the fence sitters, the people who supported other candidates. The reason why they have to be specifically Normie friendly is so that everyone here feels comfortable enough to blast them into their own personal social networks. \nThere are millions of us, blasting them into our networks extend their reach to billions. Stuff that your aunt and uncle can share with their friends too. We want them laughing and horrified. \nWe think the best stuff to focus on is每 Highlight her desire for war with Russia..每 Highlight her corruption每 Highlight Trump＊s heroism and genius and glory每 Highlight that all the smart and cool and sexy people support him. \nThis is for real now. Get off your ass and do your duty for the Fatherland. \nTo our Non American Brothers: This is your election too. The same orders apply. Help us so that we can help you. The US is the vampire heart of ZOG. If we bring it down here, you are free. Simple as that. \nAlso here are some simple tools to make stuff and modify stuff you already like. Use them, make them and then post them here for others to deploy as well.",

Through subsidization and affirmative action that makes up centuries of mean-spirited discrimination, they＊ve shown their grit in a number of fields the Old Boys Club never thought possible. They＊ve blown past the fitness tests which lives hinge on as firefighters , they demonstrate amazing coolness and discipline as police officers , and have become billionaires revolutionizing blood work as we know it. \nAnything you can do, women can do better! I don＊t know why men even exist anymore! \nA majority of women are, according to most polls, hopeful that they will be able to push new frontiers by electing the first female president of the United States. And while the Patriarchy has in the past asserted that a world run by women would essentially mean world peace, sexist bigots will be proven wrong if Hillary takes office and makes good on her promise to start a nuclear war with Russia over Syria for no coherent reason. Gen X and single women, who are too confident and smart for any man to want to marry, are the biggest Hil fanatics. \nRawwrrr, come turn off this Pussy Riot, Putin! \nYet, even with all this progress, there＊s still one last He-Man Woman-Hater＊s club that looks down on women from their glass ceiling, hogging up all the glory for themselves. Did I say glass ceiling? I meant grass floor: Mmmm , Man Tears \nThe only place in modern American culture where you will see a white male portrayed with dignity, honor and pride is in military recruitment ads. In these ads, the black man is shown at best as a white man＊s equal, rather than as a smarter, better-looking, more masculine superior, in contrast to many movies, TV shows and most commercials. In the last Iraq War, white privilege and racism meant that in our very diverse country, non-Jewish white males were overrepresented among fatalities, and are heavily over represented in frontline and infantry roles. \nWhile Neo-conservative (((Jennifer Rubin))) and others of her (((ilk))) dedicate their columns to mocking, attacking and threatening white males based on nothing but who you are, the mange-inflicted yentl buckles at the knees when you put on that uniform and die in one of the many wars she pushes for. \nGet it through your thick skull you racist, privileged, baby-dicked white boy goyim: the only thing you＊re good for is to fight for Israel! \nIn light of this institutional patriarchy and privilege, #DraftOurDaughters has emerged to raise consciousness. This social media campaign is composed of Hillary Clinton＊s coalition of non-whites and women 每 shut out of military combat roles by worthless racist rednecks 每 eager to make her dream of a World War with an emerging and more advanced superpower come true. \nWe need women, blacks, Mexicans, and especially Jews (.02% of the US military while 2% of the US population) to come on in. Women especially, who have been shut out of Selective Service for the draft, should be given priority over men when the draft comes in order to mitigate decades of discrimination. \nHere are some of the memes already floating around. #DraftOurDaughters is grassroots progress Martin Luther King Jr. (Peace Be Upon Him) would be proud of. I encourage you to make your own and put them up on Twitter, we＊ll show that rude bigot Vladimir Putin what the New America can do:",

    "text": "Hillary Screwed by a Jew Weiner \nAndrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 29, 2016 \nSo the story is that the Jew Weiner was actually having Skype jerk-off sessions with a jailbait on the same laptop his wife uses for work, and after the Daily Mail did a report on this (which contains some really raunchy quotes, including ※I would bust that tight pussy§), the FBI seized the computer. I＊m not sure why the FBI is dealing with jailbait Skype camgirls, but I guess it＊s because they were in different states. \nOn that computer we have the documents which the FBI is now claiming are of some import to the Clinton email scandal. No one knows what the documents are, or why they are relevant, and officials who have made statements on it have been pretty cagey. One said that it had something to do with collusion between the State Department and the FBI. \nThe thing here is, I don＊t really see how there could be anything on the laptop that wasn＊t already reviewed by the FBI. Unless I guess it＊s some of those 33,000 that are missing (though I personally have a hard time believing they never recovered those). \nSo the official story is that they found something on this laptop so damning that they had to immediately reopen the investigation. Something that couldn＊t wait 11 days. \nHowever, much more likely in my opinion is the ※FBI revolt§ theory. That theory would be that the FBI agents were freaking out about the miscarriage of justice, and in some way forced the hand of Comey. Because it seems to me that the guy already totally buried so much criminality, that there is no way, whatever it was, that he wouldn＊t personally be willing to bury it. \nOverall, details are very scarce at this present hour. \nBut something is going to come out in the next couple of days. You can be certain of that. If the agents themselves pressured Comey into doing this, then they believe in justice, meaning they are on the TRUMP TRAIN. So one of them is probably waiting to leak it to the media himself 每 just at the right time. \nBut get this: if Hillary goes down, Obama is going down with her. I can guarantee it. \nIf Hillary goes down, the entire system comes down. \nDonald Trump has blown the whole thing up. \nThere is swamp juicy everywhere, and everyone is seeing just how sickening the whole thing is. \nThe only thing left to do is drain it.",

    "text": "WOW: Indictment ＆Likely＊ in Clinton Foundation Case, Hillary＊s Server Hacked by FIVE Foreign Entities By: November 3, 2016 \nUh-oh. \nAccording to Bret Baier of Fox News, the FBI has been investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year, and that investigation has been deep and wide 每 and just as importantly, the FBI is on the verge of indictment for ※pay-for-play§ with regard to Hillary＊s State Department. The FBI investigation has uncovered laptops from Clinton top aides and the material on those laptops is being analyzed. \nAnd most importantly of all , the sources at the FBI have apparently told Baier with ※99 percent accuracy§ that Hillary＊s server was hacked at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and information was withdrawn. \nMeanwhile, we now know that the Department of Justice attempted to pressure the FBI into shutting down the investigation into the Clinton Foundation entirely. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI deputy director even asked the DOJ if they truly wanted to shut down a ※validly predicated investigation.§ \nThis is devastating information for Hillary. \nDonald Trump is now leading in Florida, Ohio, Nevada, Iowa, and North Carolina. Trump is within spitting distance in Colorado and Pennsylvania, and two new polls show Trump up in Virginia and New Hampshire, respectively. If Trump picks off any of those latter states, he wins the election. \nThe best case scenario for Hillary Clinton just days ago was simple: hunker down and wait out these scandals. Assume that as time goes on, the race will revert back to its pre-Comey normal, with Hillary hovering between a two and four percent lead. But each new day brings a new revelation about her corruption and the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and State Department. Each new day demonstrates the extent of the cover-up by the Obama administration. \nHillary＊s running out of days to recover. \nThe only question is whether she can hang on with her fingernails now, especially if the American public is upset enough about her pay-for-play and exposure of American classified material to put Trump in the White House, not trusting Loretta Lynch＊s DOJ to prosecute Hillary for her crimes.

Why do everybody hate her,\" Dice asks the first woman who replies, \"Because she's a criminal.\" \n\"She's a liar and I hate her voice,\" another woman tells him, adding, \"Her voice drives me crazy.\" \nA few more ladies tell Mark that Hillary is a liar, she's terrible, with one woman adding, \"She lost to Obama eight years ago so why is she still running. It's kind of absurd to me.\" \nThe women also had problems with Hillary's constant scandals, dirty money, bad policies, and her relentlessly playing the gender card. \n\"I just believe in more personal freedom and less government control,\" one jogger told the host, while another summed it up with, \"It's time for a change, Hillary's out of here.\" \nExit thought from Dice: \nHillary Clinton is not a woman.

The camera person yells, \"Happens when you vote Trump, dummy,\" while a woman next to him shouts, \"You voted Trump? You voted Trump? Damn! Yeah, he voted Trump! Damn!\" \n\n\nThe man continues to struggle against his two attackers until he gets up and sees that a woman, presumably associated with the attackers, is going through the his car looking for valuables. \n\"Get out of my car,\" the man yells as he approaches the women, who shouts back, \"You're gonna pay for my shit!\" One of the attackers returns and starts punching the man from behind in the back of the head and then continues swinging as the man turns around. \nThe camera man and his companion continue their color commentary by laughing and yelling, \"Beat his ass! Don't vote Trump! Don't vote Trump!\" \nThe video ends with the group acknowledging that they should leave before the police arrive. \nIn the longer version of the video (below) posted on Twitter, one of the attackers gets into the driver's seat and closes the door. The beaten Trump supporter stands at the car window, presumably telling the thief to get out, as the woman starts to punch him in the back of the head and is joined by the second attacker. \nThe criminal then hits the gas and takes off in the car as the man desperately holds on from outside through the rear door's window while being dragged through the streets. \n(Warning: strong language) Blacks beat white man, steal car, dragging his body.

    "text": "Poll: Sexism Was NOT A Factor In Hillary's Loss By: Aaron Bandler November 11, 2016 \nSome leftists still reeling from Hillary Clinton's stunning defeat on Tuesday are blaming her defeat on supposed sexism against a woman president. However, a new poll suggests that sexism did not play a role at all in Clinton's loss. \nThe poll, conducted by Conquest Communications Group and published on Just Facts , featured a question specifically geared toward gauging potential sexism: \"If you were faced with a choice between a male and a female presidential candidate, who would you vote for?\" \nHere were the results (emphasis added): \nOverall, 69% of voters said ※It does not matter,§ 15% preferred a female, 12% preferred a male, 3% were unsure, and 1% refused to answer. \nMale voters and Trump voters were more likely than any other groups to say ※It does not matter,§ at 73% and 72% respectively. The other groups were not far behind and within the margins of error, with rates of: 67% for Clinton voters. 66% for undecided voters. 64% for females. \nNaturally, supporters of Trump were more likely to support a male president than a female president每25 percent to 2 percent, respectively每and Clinton supporters were more likely to support female president than a male president, 27 percent to 5 percent, respectively. \nThe survey was conducted from October 11-23, so it was taken a couple of weeks before the election. But it's hard to imagine a majority of voters all of a sudden turned into a bunch of sexists. \nThere is a little bias towards a male president among Trump voters and a little bias towards a female president among Clinton voters, but the results of the survey suggest that overall, the genitalia of a candidate is not a significant factor involved in most voters when it comes to choosing the next president of the United States. \nDemocrats will have to find a different strategy for identity politics since the gender card doesn't work. Speaking of identity politics, it looks like the race card seems to be in trouble as well . Tags",

    "text": "Wikileaks Just Released Her Full Isis Donor List With Names! \nWikiLeaks just finished the job that started few months ago! Hillary just got killed! She is not going to survive this! It＊s too much! Pure treason! \nAccording to Conservative Daily Post: Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founders of ISIS. We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it. \nAfter all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done. \nBecause of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed. \nAn email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: ※Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region§ to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of ※providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.§ \nCiting the need to ※use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets,§ said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were ※important to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country.§ \nOdd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when Hillary＊s largest donations come from those two countries. \nIn another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai, set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 ※birthday check.§ \nThe email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would ※welcome the Clinton Foundation＊s suggestions for investments in Haiti 〞 particularly on education and health.§ Desai added that while Qatar had already ※allocated most of their $20 million ＃ they were happy to consider projects we suggest.§ Like this?

    "title": "Muslim Radical Salman Hossein says Hillary will win",
    "text": "( henrymakow.com ) ※Salman Hossein (left) was forced to flee Canada in 2010 with police on his tail for antisemitic activities. From his exile in Dhaka, Bangladesh, he says Hillary will win and lead the US to world war. Masonic Jewish central bankers can＊t allow Trump to win because he will turn on them. They are already losing world control and Trump would be the final nail in their coffin.§ 〞 Henry Makow \nLD: Salman was a prolific commenter on this site whose posts had to be carefully monitored because of their constant obscenities and bloodcurdling threats of mass extermination. A Muslim radical, to put it mildly. \nSalman＊s prediction that Hillary will win is not, in my opinion, a far-fetched one. I think it is a distinct possibility if all this, as I suspect, is pure theater. A huge surprise could be in store for us in the next few days. \nA sudden announcement by FBI Director James Comey, two days before the election, giving Hillary a clean bill of health over her problematic emails, could result in a last-minute surge in support of Hillary that could sweep her into the White House. According to one report, the FBI ※may be able to sift through them [the emails under investigation] before election day .§ Additional information harmful to Trump, involving ※ his close links to the Kremlin ※, could also be manufactured in a bid to help Hillary. \nAll this, however, is pure speculation. [LD] \nSALMAN HOSSEIN : After 9-11, there were eight regimes that had not submitted to the authority of the Jewish bankers. Four of them either got taken out or bullied/bribed/coerced into bowing down 每 Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan. The only problem is that recently China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Turkey have broken out of the sphere of control. Syria is still independent and fighting to maintain its sovereignty against Israeli expansionism and Banker domination. \nPutin recently put out an arrest warrant for George Soros for currency manipulation and has issued a decree banning the Rothschild clan from Russia. Russia is also causing problems for the Israelis and the West by defending the regime of Bashar Al Assad from Nusra and Da＊esh/ISIS. Israeli expansionism has been kept in check by Russia. China has also more or less wrested free of control from the International Jewish oligarchy. As a pro-Israeli asset , Trump is not a threat to Israeli expansionism in Gaza and the West Bank. He has even opened up a campaign office in Israel. He is essentially aligning white gentile power with the Israeli-Jewish supremacist camp. He only cares about Israel and will facilitate even worse oppression of Arabs and Muslims not only in Palestine and the rest of the Greater Middle East but in the Western world as well. He consistently repeats the false ※ Muslim terrorist ※ narrative. He is even worse than George W. Bush Junior . As the alternative to the US Dollar, the new BRICS monetary system is also challenging Jewish control of international finance. The heavyweights in the BRICS alliance are Russia and China. There are those who claim that BRICS is also covertly run by the Jewish bankers. I don＊t buy this. The Chinese are fully aware of the Jewish question . The Russians kicked out Jewish criminals . They won＊t be able to penetrate the economy as well as they have done in the Western world. THE DILEMMA OF JEWISH SUPREMACISM Jewish supremacists view European gentiles as either pawns for their game of global conquest and perpetual warfare or if that is not feasible 每 their targets of destruction and hatred. Historically speaking, Jews have been expelled over 109 times in history. 105 of these times have been in Europe. That is why left-wing Jewish groups are so vehemently pushing for the replacement and liquidation of indigenous Europeans by either making them a minority or making those countries uninhabitable via the anticipated thermonuclear warfare which they are instigating . Most White Americans, Australians, Canadians, and New Zealanders are also of European ancestry 每 and are also targets for destruction/revenge by these Jewish extremists/supremacists for many decades now. The influx of refugees by Jewish groups with the assistance of organized crime gangs is Talmudic vengeance par excellence. For the Diaspora Jews, its an all-or-nothing zero sum game. They either take their chances with NATO and go all in against China, Iran, Russia, and eventually Turkey or eventually risk losing more countries from their grip and/or control. However, going head on against them will lead to World War Three. Their hatred for white gentiles is so great (due to past perceived historical injustices) that they are willing to risk death themselves in the process of getting others killed. There is no where the so-called (Jewish dominated) elite can really hide or travel to. All their contingency plans are being exposed . TRUMP IS LESSER OF TWO EVILS Trump is the lesser of the two evils because he does not appear insane enough to go after China and Russia at the same time. However, I personally prefer NATO going up against China and Russia. The West has been killing defenseless people as target practice alone for the last few centuries alone 每 they need a challenge this time. Russia along with assistance from China will put them in their place. The great news is that the Jewish war-mongers have already won! Hillary has already been declared the war president of the United States. I support Hillary Clinton in her desire to go to war against Russia. I have been praying for the day this would happen. In fact, thermonuclear warfare is just right around the corner. Nobody should be complaining about this. Without thermonuclear warfare, there is no way International Jewry＊s grip on temporal power can be crushed. That is the other reason I left Canada! I＊d like to end this piece by sending out the following Halloween message to everyone: Enjoy the party while it lasts! Make sure you have a blast! Hasta La Vista Baby!!! Like this?

    "title": "For every argument the media make against Trump, Hillary＊s worse",
    "text": "By ANN COULTER 13 reasons for voting for Donald Trump \n(1) Eleven years ago, Trump said on a secretly recorded tape that celebrities can do anything 〞 even grab a woman＊s p*ssy. \nHillary, born-again Victorian virgin, campaigns with Beyonce, who performs a duet with the words ※curvalicious, p*ssy served delicious.§ \nHillary is thrilled to have the support of Madonna 〞 who has publicly offered to give blow jobs to anyone who votes for Hillary. (She＊ll even remove her teeth!) \nHillary＊s campaign has deployed Miley Cyrus to canvas for her 〞 when Cyrus is not busy inviting men in the audience to reach up and grab her p*ssy. (Here＊s a video of delicate flower Miley Cyrus in action.) \nWhen Vernon Jordan was asked by CBS＊ Mike Wallace what he talked about while golfing with Bill Clinton 〞 aka Hillary＊s husband 〞 he answered: ※P*ssy.§ \nOh, and 11 years before Teddy Kennedy ran for president as the Conscience of the Democratic Party 〞 he killed a girl. After grabbing her p*ssy. \n(2) Trump＊s a sexual predator! \nHillary＊s husband is a well-established rapist, groper and pants-dropper. She＊s his fixer. \nUnlike the serial predations of her husband, leveled repeatedly throughout the decades, the timing of these 11th-hour allegations against Trump make them highly suspect. \nRecall that The New York Times spent months investigating Trump＊s treatment of women earlier this year. The Newspaper of Record put its best reporters on the job, interviewed a dozen women, and the paper splashed the story on its front page. But the best the Timescould come up with was a story about Trump, as a bachelor, publicly praising a model for looking great in a bikini at his pool party. Then they dated. The horror. \nFive months later, just days before the election, there doesn＊t seem to be a female Democrat who isn＊t claiming to have been groped by Trump 〞 and getting loads of fawning publicity. \n(3) Trump doesn＊t give enough to charity. \nThe media only counts ※charitable giving§ if it can be taken as a tax deduction with the IRS. When Trump spent time and money saving a Georgia family farm from foreclosure in the 1980s, for example, he didn＊t get any tax write-off. \nHillary, by contrast, was a big philanthropist because, at about the same time, she was taking a deduction for donations of Bill＊s used underwear 〞 the modern equivalent of smallpox-laden blankets. Today, the munificent Clinton Foundation spends less than 10 percent of its revenues on actual charity, using about 90 percent for salaries, offices and travel. \n(4) Several of Trump＊s businesses went bankrupt. \nTrump has created or helped create hundreds of businesses. Fewer than 10 went bankrupt. Hillary had one business, Whitewater Development Corp., and it went bankrupt 〞 after ripping off scores of ordinary Americans. Also, a dozen prominent Arkansans went to prison in connection with sleazy financial transactions involving Whitewater. \n(5) Trump University was a scam! \nApproximately 10,000 graduates of Trump University were thrilled with the program and said so in writing. But a law firm that paid Hillary and Bill Clinton $675,000 for three speeches managed to find a handful of disgruntled students to be the named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against it. \nTrump University was a minuscule portion of Trump＊s portfolio. Whitewater was a huge part of Bill and Hillary＊s get-rich-quick schemes, scamming the elderly, retirees and working-class Americans for the money-hungry Clintons. \nAs described by The Washington Post, people who bought property from the Whitewater Development Corp. were required to submit a down payment, followed by monthly payments, until the entire purchase price of the property was paid off. But if buyers missed a single payment for any reason, the entire transaction would be deemed null and void, and the property, as well as all prior payments, would be forfeited to the Whitewater corporation. No foreclosure proceeding, no court hearing, no due process. \nMore than half of Whitewater＊s customers lost their entire investment. (See ※Whitewater Repossessions; Sales Practice Benefited Clintons, Partners,§ The Washington Post, April 21, 1994.) \nThough Hillary had long claimed to have nothing to do with the operation of the business, when the books were finally opened, it turned out that the monthly checks were mailed to the Whitewater Development Corp. 〞 ※care of Hillary Rodham Clinton.§ (See ※Records Show Wider Role for Hillary Clinton; Whitewater Papers Detail Involvement,§ The Washington Post, April 21, 1994.) \n(6) We can＊t allow Trump access to nuclear codes! \nHillary is the one who is champing at the bit to go to war with Russia, which, I am reliably informed, is a nuclear power. \nAt least Hillary＊s adept at dealing with sensitive digital information. Huma! Quick! Are the nuclear launch codes on my Blackberry, my desktop thingy or my Facebook page? \nCompared to Hillary, we＊d be safer if the nuclear codes were held by Miley Cyrus (unless she kept them in her p*ssy). \n(7) Trump＊s temperament will get us into World War III. \nHillary＊s temperament drove her to push for intervention in the Libyan civil war against Moammar Gadhafi for the sole purpose of giving her a foreign policy success that could be all her own. \nObama was skeptical. Libya was Hillary＊s baby. (Sidney Blumenthal＊s email to Hillary: ※First, brava! This is a historic moment and you will be credited for realizing it.§) \nAfter Gadhafi was killed, Hillary＊s temperament led her to go on TV and laughingly say, ※We came. We saw. He died.§ \nUnfortunately, Hillary hadn＊t given the slightest thought to what would come next. What came next was: the Muslim Brotherhood, the murder of Americans in Benghazi and millions of refugees pouring into Western Europe. \n(8) Trump failed to denounce David Duke with the ferocity deemed sufficient by our media. \nNo one even knows if Duke actually exists or is just a phantom produced by the media every four years to smear Republicans. \nI know that no one has ever been incited to commit murder after listening to a David Duke speech. Lots of people have been murdered by someone who＊d just heard an Al Sharpton speech: seven at Freddy＊s Fashion Mart in Harlem, and one Orthodox Jew, plus one Italian mistaken for a Jew, in Crown Heights. \nHillary has not disavowed Sharpton 〞 nor would our media be so rude as to ask. \nThe mother of Ferguson thug Mike Brown, Lesley McSpadden, campaigns with Hillary 〞 she even took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. The father of Omar Mateen, the Orlando nightclub shooter, appeared on stage behind Hillary at a rally. \nIf the media won＊t ask her to ※disavow§ the relatives of criminals and terrorists featured at her events, could they at least ask her if she approves of their parenting techniques? \n(9) Trump is a ※racist§ because of his plan to remove Muslim jihadists, Mexican drug dealers and rapists from our country. \nApart from the fact that ※drug dealer,§ ※rapist§ and ※jihadist§ are not races, we didn＊t do anything to Muslims or Mexicans, except send them billions of dollars in foreign aid. The only ※racism§ Americans care about is that toward black Americans. We did something to them. \nHillary asks blacks to vote for her, then vows to bring in millions of Muslims and Mexicans to take their jobs 〞 the ones that ※Americans just won＊t do.§ That＊s racism. \n(10) Trump ※fat-shamed§ Miss Universe! \nNo, he didn＊t 〞 he saved her crown and she was grateful. It＊s on tape. \nBut more importantly, the Miss Universe in question is Alicia Machado, well-known in Venezuela as a publicity-seeking clown. \nMachado is credibly accused of: driving the getaway car in an attempted murder; threatening to kill a federal judge; and being the baby mama to drug cartel kingpin Gerardo Alvarez-Vazquez, who was on the State Department＊s ※Most Wanted§ list under 〞 let＊s see, checking my notes 〞 Hillary Clinton. \nUntil 1975, everyone would have realized that it＊s stupid to bring in single mothers with no marketable job skills, to add to the dependent class. If we did bring them in, politicians wouldn＊t proudly introduce them at rallies. \nBut Machado is Hillary＊s model immigrant. Her only job skill is voting. Upside: Hillary gets another vote. Downside: You＊ll be supporting Machado and her anchor baby for the rest of their lives, America. \n(11) Trump is challenging the very foundation of our democracy by saying elections are rigged! \nThey are rigged 〞 ask former Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota, whose 2008 election was provably stolen from him when more than a thousand ineligible felons voted for Al Franken in a race Coleman lost by 312 votes. (At least it wasn＊t an important election: Franken provided the 60th, and deciding, vote to pass Obamacare.) \nIn any event, Hillary says the election is rigged, too 〞 by the Russkies! \nThe Democrats and the media have gone full John Birch Society on us. There＊s a fifth column in America 〞 and their leader is Donald Trump!!! \nThis is a marked departure from their previous cosmopolitan sangfroid about communism. We could have really used this fighting spirit during the Cold War. Instead, we got Jimmy Carter warning Americans about their ※inordinate fear of communism.§ \nToday, bad-ass, eye-rolling journalists are somberly announcing: ※I have in my hand a list 〞 a list of Donald Trump supporters, who are a conscious, articulate instrument of the Russian conspiracy ＃§ \n(12) Trump is shallow, has a microscopic attention span and has not studied political issues deeply. \nOn the other hand, he has a good heart, good judgment and wants the right outcome for America: limits on immigration, fair trade deals, the elimination of Wall Street tax breaks and no more pointless Middle East wars. \nHillary doesn＊t want any of these things. She is good at memorizing all her little facts, but is deeply evil. She wakes up early in the morning to make sure she does the wrong thing for America. \n(13) Trump has personal baggage. \nThis election is not about Trump. It＊s never been about Trump. Anyone running on his platform of putting Americans first would be torn to shreds. \nThere are probably lots of bad things Trump＊s done in his personal life in the past. The ruling class wants Hillary to do bad things to our country in the future.",

    "title": "Explosive Assange/Pilger Interview on US Election: Expect Riots if Hillary Wins",
    "text": "Other Writers RT : ※Whistleblower Julian Assange has given one of his most incendiary interviews ever in a John Pilger Special [released late yesterday] courtesy of Dartmouth Films. Here he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of Clinton emails leaked by WikiLeaks this year.§ \nLD : Despite the enormous populist support for Trump and the extraordinary loathing in which Hillary Clinton is held by millions of American, Assange says that ※Trump cannot be allowed to win.§ \nTrump has already indicated that he will not recognize the result of the election if he loses, given the enormous enthusiasm he has generated during his speeches, compared to the relatively tepid and anaemic response evoked by Hillary Clinton on similar occasions. Recent news reports reveal that ※election related violence is increasing and Right-wing armed militia groups are even preparing for unrest if Mrs Clinton ＆steals＊ the election, as they fear will happen.§ \nIf Hillary Clinton wins this election, as Assange predicts, we can expect riots to erupt all across America. Violent insurrection, in the circumstances of a rigged election, would appear to be more than justified. Hillary Clinton clearly belongs behind bars, not in the White House. [LD] John Pilger ( left ) conducted the 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy where Assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the US. Here is a transcript of the interview followed by the YouTube interview itself. THE SECRET WORLD OF THE US ELECTION John Pilger: What＊s the significance of the FBI＊s intervention in these last days of the U.S. election campaign, in the case against Hillary Clinton? \nJulian Assange: If you look at the history of the FBI, it has become effectively America＊s political police. The FBI demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the CIA General David Petraeus over classified information given to his mistress. Almost no-one is untouchable. The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that no-one can resist us. But Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBI＊s investigation, so there＊s anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak. We＊ve published about 33,000 of Clinton＊s emails when she was Secretary of State. They come from a batch of just over 60,000 emails, [of which] Clinton has kept about half 〞 30,000 〞 to herself, and we＊ve published about half. \nThen there are the Podesta emails we＊ve been publishing. John Podesta is Hillary Clinton＊s primary campaign manager, so there＊s a thread that runs through all these emails; there are quite a lot of pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations. These emails are combined with the cover up of the Hillary Clinton emails when she was Secretary of State, which has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI increases. \n＆Russian government not the source of Clinton leaks＊ \nPILGER : The Clinton campaign has said that Russia is behind all of this, that Russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for WikiLeaks and its emails. \nASSANGE : The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source. \n＆Saudi Arabia & Qatar funding ISIS and Clinton＊ \nPILGER : The emails that give evidence of access for money and how Hillary Clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically, are quite extraordinary. I＊m thinking of when the Qatari representative was given five minutes with Bill Clinton for a million dollar cheque. \nASSANGE : And twelve million dollars from Morocco ＃ \nPILGER : Twelve million from Morocco, yeah. \nASSANGE : For Hillary Clinton to attend a party. \nPILGER : In terms of the foreign policy of the United States, that＊s where the emails are most revealing, where they show the direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East. Can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of ISIL, are actually those who have helped create it. \nASSANGE : There＊s an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, not so long after she left the State Department, to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Now this is the most significant email in the whole collection, and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation. Even the U.S. government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL, or ISIS. But the dodge has always been that, well it＊s just some rogue Princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. \nBut that email says that no, it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS. \nPILGER : The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the Saudis and the Qataris, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation while Hilary Clinton is Secretary of State and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to Saudi Arabia. \nASSANGE : Under Hillary Clinton, the world＊s largest ever arms deal was made with Saudi Arabia, worth more than $80 billion. In fact, during her tenure as Secretary of State, total arms exports from the United States in terms of the dollar value, doubled. \nPILGER : Of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called ISIl or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation. \nASSANGE : Yes. \nPILGER : That＊s extraordinary. \n＆Clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition＊ \nASSANGE : I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of the reaction to their ambitions. She represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. The question is how does Hilary Clinton fit in this broader network? She＊s a centralising cog. You＊ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street, and Intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis. \nShe＊s the centraliser that inter-connects all these different cogs. She＊s the smooth central representation of all that, and ＆all that＊ is more or less what is in power now in the United States. It＊s what we call the establishment or the DC consensus. One of the more significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed and how half the Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from City Bank. This is quite amazing. \nPILGER : Didn＊t Citybank supply a list＃ ? \nASSANGE : Yes. \nPILGER : Which turned out to be most of the Obama cabinet? \nASSANGE : Yes. \nPILGER : So Wall Street decides the cabinet of the President of the United States? \nASSANGE : If you were following the Obama campaign back then, closely, you could see it had become very close to banking interests. So I think you can＊t properly understand Hillary Clinton＊s foreign policy without understanding Saudi Arabia. The connections with Saudi Arabia are so intimate. \n＆Libya is Hillary Clinton＊s war＊ PILGER : Why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of Libya? Can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us 每 told you 每 about what happened there? Because Libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in Syria: the ISIL, jihadism, and so on. And it was almost Hillary Clinton＊s invasion. What do the emails tell us about that? \nASSANGE : Libya, more than anyone else＊s war, was Hillary Clinton＊s war. Barak Obama initially opposed it. Who was the person championing it? Hillary Clinton. That＊s documented throughout her emails. She had put her favoured agent, Sidney Blumenthal, on to that; there＊s more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand Hillary Clinton emails that we＊ve published, just about Libya. It＊s not that Libya has cheap oil. She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state 〞 something that she would use in her run-up to the general election for President. \nSo in late 2011 there is an internal document called the Libya Tick Tock that was produced for Hillary Clinton, and it＊s the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state, which resulted in around 40,000 deaths within Libya; jihadists moved in, ISIS moved in, leading to the European refugee and migrant crisis. \nNot only did you have people fleeing Libya, people fleeing Syria, the destabilisation of other African countries as a result of arms flows, but the Libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. Libya faces along to the Mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of Africa. So all problems, economic problems and civil war in Africa 〞 previously people fleeing those problems didn＊t end up in Europe because Libya policed the Mediterranean. That was said explicitly at the time, back in early 2011 by Gaddafi: ＆What do these Europeans think they＊re doing, trying to bomb and destroy the Libyan State? There＊s going to be floods of migrants out of Africa and jihadists into Europe, and this is exactly what happened. \n＆Trump won＊t be permitted to win＊ \nPILGER : You get complaints from people saying, ＆What is WikiLeaks doing? Are they trying to put Trump in the White House?＊ \nASSANGE : My answer is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he＊s had every establishment off side; Trump doesn＊t have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence agencies, arms companies＃ big foreign money ＃ are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves. \nPILGER : There is the accusation that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians. Some people say, ＆Well, why doesn＊t WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia?＊ \nASSANGE : We have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our Russia documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up. \nPILGER : Do you yourself take a view of the U.S. election? Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump? \nASSANGE : Let＊s talk about Donald Trump. What does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind? He represents American white trash, which Hillary Clinton called ＆deplorable and irredeemable＊. It means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are like the red necks, and you can never deal with them. Because he so clearly 〞 through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies 〞 represents people who are not the middle, not the upper middle educated class, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting Trump in any way, including any criticism of Hillary Clinton. If you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, that makes absolute sense. \n＆US attempting to squeeze WikiLeaks through my refugee status＊ \nPILGER : I＊d like to talk about Ecuador, the small country that has given you refuge and political asylum in this embassy in London. Now Ecuador has cut off the internet from here where we＊re doing this interview, in the Embassy, for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the U.S. election campaign. Can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on Ecuador＊s support for you? \nASSANGE : Let＊s let go back four years. I made an asylum application to Ecuador in this embassy, because of the U.S. extradition case, and the result was that after a month, I was successful in my asylum application. The embassy since then has been surrounded by police: quite an expensive police operation which the British government admits to spending more than ㏒12.6 million. They admitted that over a year ago. Now there＊s undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds 〞 so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of London between Ecuador, a country of sixteen million people, and the United Kingdom, and the Americans who have been helping on the side. So that was a brave and principled thing for Ecuador to do. Now we have the U.S. election campaign, the Ecuadorian election is in February next year, and you have the White House feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing. \nWikiLeaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of Ecuador, from this embassy or in the territory of Ecuador; we publish from France, we publish from, from Germany, we publish from The Netherlands and from a number of other countries, so that the attempted squeeze on WikiLeaks is through my refugee status; and this is, this is really intolerable. It means that [they] are trying to get at a publishing organisation; they try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the American people and others about an election. \nPILGER : Tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy. \nASSANGE : I would be immediately arrested by the British police and I would then be extradited either immediately to the United States or to Sweden. In Sweden I am not charged, I have already been previously cleared by the Senior Stockholm Prosecutor Eva Finne. We were not certain exactly what would happen there, but then we know that the Swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the United States we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the U.S. has requested since at least 2000. So over the last fifteen years, every single person the U.S. has tried to extradite from Sweden has been extradited, and they refuse to provide a guarantee [that won＊t happen]. \nPILGER : People often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here. \nASSANGE : Look, one of the best attributes of human beings is that they＊re adaptable; one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable. They adapt and start to tolerate abuses, they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses, they adapt to adversity and they continue on. So in my situation, frankly, I＊m a bit institutionalised 〞 this [the embassy] is the world ＃ it＊s visually the world for me. \nPILGER : It＊s the world without sunlight, for one thing, isn＊t it? \nASSANGE : It＊s the world without sunlight, but I haven＊t seen sunlight in so long, I don＊t remember it. \nPILGER : Yes. \nASSANGE : So , yes, you adapt. The one real irritant is that my young children 〞 they also adapt. They adapt to being without their father. That＊s a hard, hard adaption which they didn＊t ask for. \nPILGER : Do you worry about them? \nASSANGE : Yes, I worry about them; I worry about their mother. \n＆I am innocent and in arbitrary detention＊ \nPILGER : Some people would say, ＆Well, why don＊t you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to Sweden?＊ \nASSANGE : The U.N. [the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention] has looked into this whole situation. They spent eighteen months in formal, adversarial litigation. So it＊s me and the U.N. verses Sweden and the U.K. Who＊s right? The U.N. made a conclusion that I am being arbitrarily detained illegally, deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the United Kingdom and Sweden, and that those countries must obey. It is an illegal abuse. It is the United Nations formally asking, ＆What＊s going on here? What is your legal explanation for this? Assange says that you should recognise his asylum.＊ And here is. \nSweden formally writing back to the United Nations to say, ＆No, we＊re not going to recognise the UN ruling, so leaving open their ability to extradite. \nI just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press, because it doesn＊t suit the Western establishment narrative 〞 that yes, the West has political prisoners, it＊s a reality, it＊s not just me, there＊s a bunch of other people as well. The West has political prisoners. Of course, no state accepts that it should call the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons, political prisoners. They don＊t call them political prisoners in China, they don＊t call them political prisoners in Azerbaijan and they don＊t call them political prisoners in the United States, U.K. or Sweden; it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self-perception. \nASSANGE : Here we have a case, the Swedish case, where I have never been charged with a crime, where I have already been cleared by the Stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric? \nPILGER : Yes, it＊s different. \nASSANGE : The rhetoric is pretending, constantly pretending that I have been charged with a crime, and never mentioning that I have been already previously cleared, never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up. \nThe rhetoric is trying to avoid the truth that the U.N. formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, I am subject to persecution by the United States.",

    "title": "Comment on When Asked about Undercover Videos, Hillary Walks Out on Press Conference by Matibob",
    "text": "Posted on October 26, 2016 by Michael DePinto \nFor anyone who has heard about, but not yet had a chance to learn the details about the undercover operation produced by James O＊Keefe ＊s Project Veritas about the inner workings of the Democrat Party, you＊re in luck. I have written two different posts covering the subject from different angles, and this will be the third, covering Hillary＊s response. Each post include at least some, if not all of the undercover recordings released so far by James O＊Keefe . \nFor over a year, O＊Keefe risked his life by going deep undercover into the Democrat Party＊s factory of corruption, and just this week after everyone laughed at Trump for calling the election rigged, O＊Keefe began releasing portions of the SHOCKING video he took while undercover. In the videos, some of the highest ranking members of the DNC make some of the most jaw-dropping admissions of guilt you＊ve EVER heard in your lives, not the least of which is, ※[w]e have a call with Hillary＊s campaign EVERY DAY to go over what areas need more focus.§ \nIn the first post I wrote titled, George Soros＊ Master Blueprint to Conquer the West Gets Caught on Camera , I go into detail about how the money funding all the illegal operations caught on film comes from Hillary Clinton ＆s largest donor, none other than George Soros . One very high ranking Democratic operative explains what happens with the money once it comes in. Upon receipt: \n※[t]he campaign (Hillary Clinton campaign) pays the DNC, the DNC pays Democracy partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval group, and the Foval Group goes and executes the sh** on the ground.§ \nWOW! Then, when questioned about the legality, the response was: \n※It doesn＊t matter what the friggin＊ legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherf**ker.§ \nThat＊s just the beginning. The evidence gets infinitely worse. Then, in the second post I wrote titled, This Video Guarantees a Trump Win Even With Hillary＊s Fraud Machine , I present an honest look at both candidates, and how they operate. The post contains 100% of the released undercover footage so far, so you learn EXACTLY who is prescribing what to whom, and I assure you that nothing can prepare you for what James managed to catch on film. You＊ll be sick. \nThen, I contrast the criminal enterprise Hillary is running with a montage of videos taken over a 30 year span of Donald Trump , and in each of the clips spanning all those years, Trump is asked about potentially running for the Presidency some day. Some of the answers are 30 years old, and all are spontaneous. Unlike the scripted (and now we know, totally false) statements we consistently get from Hillary, it is painfully obvious the answers Trump gives are genuine, and from the heart. \nLove him or hate him, good luck arguing that Trump isn＊t authentic in the video. You get a good look at who would be in the Oval Office, and it＊s not the caricature that Team Hillary has tried so hard to create. On the other hand, Team Hillary＊s behavior is utterly indefensible, and she knows it, which is why she runs like hell in the video below the second reporters begin to ask her about the recordings. \nThere＊s nowhere to run now though Hillary＃ You and your staff have a lot to answer for＃ much of which is criminal in nature (go figure!) \nArticle posted with permission from The Last Great Stand \nMichael DePinto is a member of the fast growing un-silent American majority that is sick of the insanity going on in this country right now.

    "title": "Wikileaks: Bill Clinton BOASTS of Hillary＊s ＆Working Relationship＊ with Muslim Brotherhood",
    "text": "Posted on October 27, 2016 by Pamela Geller \nThe bombshells about this criminal are now breaking daily. It＊s not a question of Trump, it is an imperative that Hillary be defeated. If the people choose Hillary, then they must and will be punished. ※Wikileaks: Bill Clinton Boasts of Hillary＊s ＆Working Relationship＊ with Muslim Brotherhood,§ By John Hayward, Breitbart , October 26, 2016: \nIn a speech Bill Clinton gave at the home of Mehul and Hema Sanghani in October 2015, revealed to the public for the first time by WikiLeaks, former President Bill Clinton touted Hillary Clinton＊s ※working relationship§ with the Muslim Brotherhood＊s Mohamed Morsi in Egypt as an example of her diplomatic skills.President Clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the Iran nuclear deal, in a passage that began with the standard Democrat ※stuff happens§ shrugging defense for foreign policy failures: \nFinally, we live in a world, as I said, that＊s full of good news and bad news. The United States cannot control it all, but we need a president who＊s most likely to make as many good things happen as possible, and most likely to prevent big, bad things from happening. You can＊t keep every bad thing from happening; who＊s most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way. Even the people who don＊t like the Iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadn＊t been for the sanctions. Hillary negotiated those sanctions and got China and Russia to sign off 每 something I thought she＊d never be able to do. I confess. I＊m never surprised by anything she does, but that surprised me. I didn＊t think she could do it. The Chinese and the Russians to see past their short-term self-interest to their long-term interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race. \nAnd when the Muslim Brotherhood took over in Egypt, in spite of the fact that we were (inaudible), she developed a working relationship with the then-president and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a full-scale shooting war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which on top of what was going on in Syria and the (inaudible) Jordan would have been a calamity for the world. \nAnd when we were trying to reset our relations with Russia under President Medvedev, she and her team negotiated a New START Treaty, which limits warheads and missiles. And she lobbied it through the Senate. She had to get 67 votes, which means a lot of these Republicans who say that they don＊t like her now are just kidding for election season. They trusted her, and she got it passed. You can＊t get 67 votes in the Senate without a lot of Republican support. And I don＊t know about you, but with all this tension and Mr. Putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in Syria, I think it＊s a very good thing that we＊re in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the Russians. She did that. \nYou＊ll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the Iran debacle than Bill Clinton boasting that the sanctions Barack Obama lifted were super-awesome, as even those who don＊t think those sanctions should have been lifted agree. \nMr. Clinton＊s version of the Iran sanctions leaves out a few details , such as Russia＊s keen financial interest in keeping Iranian energy out of the European market, and China＊s desire to use Iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip. \nBut the part about the Muslim Brotherhood is most interesting. If anything, he is selling Hillary Clinton＊s ※working relationship§ with Egyptian Islamists short, because she used American diplomatic leverage for Morsi＊s benefit even before he got elected, warning Egyptians about ※backtracking§ to a military regime at a key moment of the post-Mubarak campaign, when Morsi was running against a former member of Hosni Mubarak＊s military. There have long been rumors that more subtle forms of U.S. ※ pressure § were used to secure Morsi＊s office, as well. \nThen again, in public pronouncements, Clinton called Hosni Mubarak＊s tottering regime ※stable§ and cautioned her Obama Administration colleagues against ※pushing a longtime partner out the door.§ \nA few days ago, declassified State Department documents revealed Clinton＊s talking points for a 2012 meeting with Morsi hailed his election as a ※milestone in Egypt＊s transition to democracy,§ and stated that she was to offer the Muslim Brotherhood leader ※technical expertise and assistance from both the U.S. government and private sector to support his economic and social programs.§ \nClinton was also supposed to privately offer Morsi assistance with his police and security forces, which would be conducted ※quite discreetly.§ \nAfter Morsi was gone, she declared herself exasperated with Egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical ※realist.§ That is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the Obama Administration was saying while the ※Arab Spring§ was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but America-aligned (or at least America-fearing) regimes, which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long. \nAs for Clinton＊s superb working relationship with Morsi, that eventually ended with Morsi＊s wife railing against Clinton for supposedly dismissing him as ※a simpleton who was unfit for the presidency,§ and threatening to publish letters from Clinton to Morsi that would damage the former U.S. Secretary of State. Meanwhile, Mohammed Morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the Egyptian penitentiary system . \nEgypt has one of those icky military governments again, and while it won＊t have fond memories of Hillary Clinton＊s support for the Muslim Brotherhood regime, it will most likely work with whoever wins the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Therefore, a prospective President Hillary Clinton probably won＊t suffer too much from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton＊s appalling lapses in judgment. \nCourtesy of Pamela Geller Don't forget to follow the D.C.

What could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in Trump＊s just after the debate officially ended. \nThis led to lots of speculation on whether or not Hillary cheated during the first debate against Trump and other debates as well, having her comments fed to her. \nWell, if the Wikileaks Podesta emails are any indication, it＊s very possible. Why? \nBecause apparently Hillary can＊t give long speeches without a podium. \nIn fact, these emails (and this isn＊t even all of them, but enough for you to get the picture) prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept ※short and sweet§ unless Hillary has a podium. \nSo how are we supposed to believe she was able to speak at the 90-minutes debates without prepared notes being fed to her somehow? \nEspecially that final debate where she appeared to be reading more than writing, looking down all the time at some sort of lit screen embedded in the podium as pointed out in other debates, as shown in the video above.

    "text": "Posted on October 27, 2016 by Pamela Geller \nThe bombshells about this criminal are now breaking daily. It＊s not a question of Trump, it is an imperative that Hillary be defeated. If the people choose Hillary, then they must and will be punished. ※Wikileaks: Bill Clinton Boasts of Hillary＊s ＆Working Relationship＊ with Muslim Brotherhood,§ By John Hayward, Breitbart , October 26, 2016: \nIn a speech Bill Clinton gave at the home of Mehul and Hema Sanghani in October 2015, revealed to the public for the first time by WikiLeaks, former President Bill Clinton touted Hillary Clinton＊s ※working relationship§ with the Muslim Brotherhood＊s Mohamed Morsi in Egypt as an example of her diplomatic skills.President Clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the Iran nuclear deal, in a passage that began with the standard Democrat ※stuff happens§ shrugging defense for foreign policy failures: \nFinally, we live in a world, as I said, that＊s full of good news and bad news. The United States cannot control it all, but we need a president who＊s most likely to make as many good things happen as possible, and most likely to prevent big, bad things from happening. You can＊t keep every bad thing from happening; who＊s most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way. Even the people who don＊t like the Iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadn＊t been for the sanctions. Hillary negotiated those sanctions and got China and Russia to sign off 每 something I thought she＊d never be able to do. I confess. I＊m never surprised by anything she does, but that surprised me. I didn＊t think she could do it. The Chinese and the Russians to see past their short-term self-interest to their long-term interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race. \nAnd when the Muslim Brotherhood took over in Egypt, in spite of the fact that we were (inaudible), she developed a working relationship with the then-president and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a full-scale shooting war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which on top of what was going on in Syria and the (inaudible) Jordan would have been a calamity for the world. \nAnd when we were trying to reset our relations with Russia under President Medvedev, she and her team negotiated a New START Treaty, which limits warheads and missiles. And she lobbied it through the Senate. She had to get 67 votes, which means a lot of these Republicans who say that they don＊t like her now are just kidding for election season. They trusted her, and she got it passed. You can＊t get 67 votes in the Senate without a lot of Republican support. And I don＊t know about you, but with all this tension and Mr. Putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in Syria, I think it＊s a very good thing that we＊re in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the Russians. She did that. \nYou＊ll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the Iran debacle than Bill Clinton boasting that the sanctions Barack Obama lifted were super-awesome, as even those who don＊t think those sanctions should have been lifted agree. \nMr. Clinton＊s version of the Iran sanctions leaves out a few details , such as Russia＊s keen financial interest in keeping Iranian energy out of the European market, and China＊s desire to use Iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip. \nBut the part about the Muslim Brotherhood is most interesting. If anything, he is selling Hillary Clinton＊s ※working relationship§ with Egyptian Islamists short, because she used American diplomatic leverage for Morsi＊s benefit even before he got elected, warning Egyptians about ※backtracking§ to a military regime at a key moment of the post-Mubarak campaign, when Morsi was running against a former member of Hosni Mubarak＊s military. There have long been rumors that more subtle forms of U.S. ※ pressure § were used to secure Morsi＊s office, as well. \nThen again, in public pronouncements, Clinton called Hosni Mubarak＊s tottering regime ※stable§ and cautioned her Obama Administration colleagues against ※pushing a longtime partner out the door.§ \nA few days ago, declassified State Department documents revealed Clinton＊s talking points for a 2012 meeting with Morsi hailed his election as a ※milestone in Egypt＊s transition to democracy,§ and stated that she was to offer the Muslim Brotherhood leader ※technical expertise and assistance from both the U.S. government and private sector to support his economic and social programs.§ \nClinton was also supposed to privately offer Morsi assistance with his police and security forces, which would be conducted ※quite discreetly.§ \nAfter Morsi was gone, she declared herself exasperated with Egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical ※realist.§ That is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the Obama Administration was saying while the ※Arab Spring§ was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but America-aligned (or at least America-fearing) regimes, which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long. \nAs for Clinton＊s superb working relationship with Morsi, that eventually ended with Morsi＊s wife railing against Clinton for supposedly dismissing him as ※a simpleton who was unfit for the presidency,§ and threatening to publish letters from Clinton to Morsi that would damage the former U.S. Secretary of State. Meanwhile, Mohammed Morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the Egyptian penitentiary system . \nEgypt has one of those icky military governments again, and while it won＊t have fond memories of Hillary Clinton＊s support for the Muslim Brotherhood regime, it will most likely work with whoever wins the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Therefore, a prospective President Hillary Clinton probably won＊t suffer too much from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton＊s appalling lapses in judgment. \nCourtesy of Pamela Geller Don't forget to follow the D.C.

    "title": "Comment on It Is Happening Again America! Voting Machines Are Switching Votes From Donald Trump To Hillary Clinton by donaldbreaux",
    "text": "Posted on October 26, 2016 by Michael Snyder \nIs the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote. \nMost Americans don＊t realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney＊s chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state. \nUnfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a quote from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times ＃ \n※I don＊t know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,§ said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens. \nStevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney . \n※I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney＊s name,§ Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House. \nShe said that the first time she pushed ※Romney,§ the machine marked ※Obama.§ \nSo she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time. \n※Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,§ she told Fox News. \nAnd we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago. \nFor example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012. \nIf that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren＊t even worth mentioning. \nAnd of course this didn＊t just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country . \nThe reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again. \nIn Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper ＃ \nShortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes ※switched.§ The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday. \nAnd Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas ＃ \nGary and I went to early vote today＃I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn＊t get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don＊t hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed. \nI don＊t know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that. \nA similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas ＃ \nHey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone＊s vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit! \nAnd of course they weren＊t the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon ＃ \nSo is there a serious problem with the voting machines ? \nAccording to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots＃ \nChambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters . \nChambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a ※software update§ on ES&S machines that otherwise ※omit one race§ when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch. \nLet＊s keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump＊s column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done. \nBut if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else. \nDespite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are ※no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate※＃ In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country: Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote Close to 3 million registered in multiples states Approximately 24 million〞one of every eight〞voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state \nBut despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled ※ Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead ※＃ \nAlmost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. \nAmericans overall are more confident that the nation＊s votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner. \nUnfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media. \nAnd the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up ＃ \nU.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia＊s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud. \nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. \nBut hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. \nNow that is a real ※conspiracy theory§, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn＊t so serious. \nDuring this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it. \nThe American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us. \nAnd let＊s watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong. \nCourtesy of Michael Snyder Don't forget to follow the D.C. Clothesline on Facebook and Twitter.

    "title": "Apostate Evangelicals Are Poised To Become The Deciding Factor In A Hillary Clinton Election Victory",
    "text": "Posted on October 28, 2016 by Michael Snyder \nIf you look at the numbers, there is no way that Hillary Clinton could possibly win the election without the support of a substantial percentage of evangelical Christian voters. In fact, if evangelical Christians stuck together they could pretty much elect whoever they want as president. According to the Pew Research Center, 35 percent of all adults in the United States identify themselves as ※evangelical§ or ※born again§, and it has been estimated that there are 94 million evangelical Christian adults in this country. If evangelical Christians acted as a single voting block they could determine the outcome of every single presidential election. Unfortunately, that simply is not going to happen. \nA survey that was recently conducted by LifeWay Research found that only 45 percent of Christian evangelicals plan to vote for Donald Trump and 31 percent of Christian evangelicals plan to vote for Hillary Clinton. \nThat same survey discovered that moral issues are becoming increasingly unimportant to evangelical voters＃ Overall, the economy is the top concern for Americans regardless of religious affiliation (30%). National security (17%) and personal character (17%) also are significant issues. Supreme Court nominees (10%), immigration (5%), religious freedom (2%), and abortion (1%) are less important . ※For churchgoers and those with evangelical beliefs, their pocketbook and personal safety are paramount,§ said McConnell. ※Moral issues aren＊t a priority for many of them.§ \nI don＊t know how in the world abortion could come in at only 1 percent. Even if you add ※ Supreme Court nominees § and abortion together, you still only get a total of 11 percent. \nThis just shows that evangelicals in America have their priorities way out of order. \nAnd unfortunately for Donald Trump, he is getting a lot less support from evangelicals than other recent presidential candidates received. According to the New York Times , previous candidates have generally received about 80 percent support from white evangelical voters, but Donald Trump is only getting about 65 to 70 percent support, and his numbers among non-white evangelicals are absolutely dismal. \nIf you are an evangelical Christian and you have reservations about Donald Trump, I can respect that. But there will be other names on the ballot and you do not have to vote for Hillary Clinton. As I have said before, a vote for Hillary Clinton is an act of unmitigated wickedness. \nHillary Clinton has made support for abortion one of the central pillars of her long political career. In fact, I don＊t know if there is any politician in America that is more associated with abortion than Hillary Clinton. Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, more than 58 million babies have been murdered in the United States, and Hillary Clinton＊s hands are drenched with their blood. \nIf you vote for Hillary Clinton, your hands will be drenched with their blood too. \nNeedless to say, I am absolutely horrified that so many prominent evangelical leaders have come out in support of Hillary Clinton during this election season. For example, a group that represents over 6,000 Latino evangelical churches has just announced that they are endorsing Hillary Clinton ＃ \nAn organization representing more than 6,000 Latino evangelical churches in the U.S. is endorsing Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. \nIn a statement Thursday, the group OPEN USA says Clinton has proven her willingness to engage in difficult conversations, listen to contrasting opinions and engage faith leaders. \nMeanwhile, 75 evangelical leaders recently signed a petition on Change.org that strongly denounces Donald Trump＃ \nWe, undersigned evangelicals, simply will not tolerate the racial, religious, and gender bigotry that Donald Trump has consistently and deliberately fueled, no matter how else we choose to vote or not to vote. \nOne of the truly alarming trends that we have been seeing this election season is the number of prominent women in the evangelical movement that are openly rejecting Donald Trump and embracing Hillary Clinton. The following is a short excerpt from a recent Washington Post article that examined this phenomenon＃ \nWhen Jen Hatmaker speaks to stadiums full of Christian women, she regales them with stories about her five children and her garden back in Austin, Tex. 〞 and stays away from politics. But recently she took to Facebook and Instagram to blast Donald J. Trump as a ※national disgrace,§ and remind her legions of followers that there are other names on the ballot in November. \nAnd Christianity Today recently published an editorial from one of the top female evangelical leaders in the entire country in which she publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton. According to Christianity Today, Deborah Fikes is ※the former Permanent Representative to the United Nations for World Evangelical Alliance, which represents a constituency of 650 million with alliance offices in 129 countries.§ Fikes says that she stepped down from some of her leadership positions so that she could openly advocate for Clinton ＃ My recent resignations from evangelical leadership positions to endorse Hillary Clinton speaks volumes of how important I believe it is that she is elected in November. The toxic tone and atmosphere that surrounds Mr. Trump and is fueled among his supporters has done irreparable damage to not only our country and the future of the GOP but also to the public witness of evangelicals in America who are seen as some of his biggest supporters. There is no question in my mind or spirit that with the overwhelming challenges the next American president will face, Hillary Clinton is the most qualified person who has ever run for the Oval Office . On the issues of our national security, economic stability, seeing that healthcare reform continues to move forward, and tackling domestic challenges of poverty, inequality, and racism, we need her to be the person occupying this office. \nA lot of these women seem to think that abortion shouldn＊t be a major issue in this election, but that is like saying that the Holocaust shouldn＊t have been a major issue in Nazi Germany. \nLook, you don＊t have to vote for Donald Trump or anyone else to be a good Christian. \nBut if you cast a vote for Hillary Clinton, you are casting a vote for the most evil, wicked and corrupt politician that this nation has possibly ever seen, and you are publicly endorsing the sinful positions that she is proud to stand for. \nI know that I have been writing about the election a lot lately , but I feel that it is very important that I do so. Most of the media coverage has focused on Donald Trump , but I feel that this election is far more about Hillary Clinton. The things that her and her husband have done have been well documented, and if the American people willingly choose her they will know exactly what they are doing. \nUnfortunately, not even Christians are standing united against the Clintons. The political divide in the evangelical Christian world has grown so deep that it has even reached Liberty University. The following comes from the Atlantic ＃ \nThat＊s why it was such a big deal when, two weeks ago, a group of Liberty students put out a letter explaining why they＊re standing against the Republican presidential nominee. Jerry Falwell Jr., who has run the school since his father died in 2007, announced his support for Donald Trump back in January, and he has since spoken on the candidate＊s behalf in interviews and at events. ※We are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell＊s endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history,§ the students wrote. ※Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him.§ \nThousands of people signed onto the letter, including, the students said, roughly 2,000 students or alumni with liberty.edu email addresses.Dustin Wahl and Alex Forbes, two of the letter＊s authors, were featured on MSNBC and CNN. They said they received supportive emails and tweets from Russell Moore, the head of the political arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, and Erick Erickson, the conservative radio-show host. \nAnd the support for Clinton is particularly strong among young adult evangelicals. When I read the following paragraph on the website of the New York Times , I was absolutely astounded＃ \nKate Shellnutt, 30, the online editor of Christianity Today and editor of the CT Women section, said she had observed that ※the millennial generation has a lot less patience for Trump.§ Of the 33 influential millennial evangelicals she profiled for a cover story two years ago, she says she can now find only one, Lila Rose, who is pro-Trump, and even she has been publicly critical of him . Several have been using the hashtag #NeverTrump, Ms. Shellnutt said. \nThe frightening thing is that this election might be the last chance for evangelical Christians to shape the political direction of this nation, because the truth is that demographics are rapidly shifting, and this includes the demographics of the evangelical community ＃ \nAs Robert Jones has expertly documented in his recent book The End of White Christian America , the number of older, conservative, white male evangelicals is shrinking each year. Meanwhile, the number of younger evangelicals of all ethnic backgrounds 〞 whose moral and political views extend far beyond positions on gay marriage and abortion 〞 is on the rise. \nIf you follow my work regularly, then you already know that I have very little hope for the future of America. \nBut if Hillary Clinton is elected, there will be exactly zero hope. \nIf evangelical Christians stood united, they could stop her, but at this point it appears that is not going to happen. \nCourtesy of Michael Snyder Don't forget to follow the D.C.

    "title": "21 Things We＊ve Learned About Hillary Clinton from Wikileaks That the MSM Won＊t Share＃But YOU Can!",
    "text": "Posted on October 28, 2016 by Daisy Luther \nLet＊s talk about Wikileaks . \nFirst of all, the organization was founded by Julian Assange back in 2006. Their website explains what they are all about: \n※WikiLeaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war, spying, and corruption. It has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses.§ \nIn the 11 years that they＊ve been publishing documents, they have not been disproven a single time. Their record for authentication is perfect. (Learn more here and here .) \nSo this means that a person would be pretty silly to disregard anything in the reams of information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, the Clinton Foundation, and the political shenanigans that would put the Machiavellis to shame. \nHere are 21 of the most important things that have come out about Hillary Clinton, that unfortunately, no one is reporting on in the mainstream. In the interest of brevity, each topic has a link to an article that goes deeper into the leak. (In no particular order.) John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign had a nice cozy dinner with Peter Kadzik, one of the top officials in the Department of Justice＃the day after the Benghazi hearing . Kadzik＊s son also asked for a job on the Clinton campaign, and, the icing on the corruption cupcake? Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch, who famously met with Bill Clinton on her private plane right before Hillary＊s interrogation about Emailgate. ( source ) We all knew that the Clinton Foundation was just a way for the Clinton family to launder money, and now there＊s proof. Zero Hedge writes, ※＃today＊s Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band＊s firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family＊s private business endeavors.§ A pundit called this leak ※The Rosetta Stone of the Clinton Foundation,§ meaning that with this document, all of their shady financial dealings could be unraveled and translated. ( source ) Clinton is unable to speak for very long without a podium to lean on . Numerous leaked emails reference how certain interviews have to be kept short because she＊d be without one. And this article references a very interesting reason why this may be the case 每 surprisingly it isn＊t related to her health. ( source ) The leaks also show that Clinton intends to do her best to restrict the Second Amendment. Brian Fallon, the national press secretary for the Clinton campaign, wrote, ※ Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President 每 universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability .§ According to an analysis on The Daily Sheeple, ※Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook, Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold.§ ( source ) The campaign was concerned that the sexual escapades of Bill Clinton could be likened to those of another disgraced celebrity, Bill Cosby . Political operative Ron Klain sent an urgent email saying that Hillary should anticipate the following questions, § How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did? Is his conduct relevant to your campaign? You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused him? Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?§ ( source ) Clinton＊s campaign deliberately leaked an embarrassing photo of a swimsuit-clad Bernie Sanders to the press, ironically insinuating that it was proof he was bought off by Wall Street. Perez Hilton wrote, ※ Bernie Sanders lounges at elite Martha＊s Vineyard pool, summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists .§ ( source ) Clinton admitted she is out of touch with the middle class in a speech to Goldman-Black Rock in 2014. ※And I am not taking a position on any policy, but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. And I never had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean, were there really rich people, of course there were. My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We had accessible health care. We had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn＊t believe in mortgages. So I lived that. And now, obviously, I＊m kind of far removed because the life I＊ve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy , but I haven＊t forgotten it.§ ( source ) She made this rather NWO remark at a 2013 paid speech to Brazilian bank Banco Itau: ※ My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders , some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.§ ( source ) In a leak of yet another paid speech, this time to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013, Clinton said that Jordan and Turkey ※ can＊t possibly vet all those refugees so they don＊t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.§ Meanwhile, if Clinton has her way , we will be warmly welcoming 65,000 refugees a year, which makes Obama＊s 10,000 a year look like small potatoes. ( source ) Clinton blackmailed the Chinese by telling them that the US would base missiles in the region if they didn＊t exert some control over North Korean aggression. ※ So China, come on. You either control them or we＊re going to have to defend against them ,§ she purportedly told the audience at a Goldman Sachs conference in June 2013. ( source ) In May 2015, Clinton was no longer Secretary of State but was ready to announce she was running for President when she was invited to attend a summit in Morrocco. The implication from the leaked emails was that a $12 million ※donation§ from the king of Morocco was dependent on Clinton attending the summit. Human Abedin, usually loyal to her boss, had concerns . ※ If HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter. She created this mess and she knows it. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this,§ Abedin wrote to Robbie Mook in a November 2014 email. Incidentally, Clinton didn＊t attend. Bill and Chelsea went instead and the $12 million donation was not forthcoming. (source ) Podesta attacked Clinton＊s primary election rival Bernie Sanders for criticizing the Paris climate change agreement. ※ Can you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it? § said Podesta. ( source ) Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria . ※ My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,§ she told employees of the bank in South Carolina, which had paid her about $225,000 to give a speech. ※We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can＊t help themselves. They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we＊re doing and I want credit for it. § (source ) There is indeed a definite link between the Clinton campaign and what MSM is allowed to say. The campaign has colluded directly with media spokespersons that read like a Who＊s Who in American Media : Dan Merica from CNN, Haim Saban of Univision, John Harwood of CNBC and the NY Times, Rebecca Quick of CNBC, Maggie Haberman of NY Times and Politico, John Harris of Politico, Donna Brazile formerly of CNN, Roland Martin of TV-One, Marjorie Pritchard of The Boston Globe, and Louise Mensch of Heat Street. ( source ) As everyone knows, the DNC deliberately screwed Bernie Sanders out of the nomination ( Bonus: Wikileaks also released some of the DNC＊s voicemails on the topic ). There are emails that prove who is actually pulling HRC＊s puppet strings and that puppeteer is George Soros . The shadow government is not just a conspiracy theory 每 it really exists and Hillary＊s job is to keep George Soros happy. ( source ) Excerpts from her speeches to Wall Street read like a guide to two-faced treachery. In them, she clearly points out that sometimes you ※need§ to lie. ※If everybody＊s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.§ ( source ) Wikileaks emails show that back when she still worked for CNN and before she became an employee of the Clinton campaign, Donna Brazile gave Hillary the questions in advance for her ※impromptu§ CNN Town Hall questions. ( source ) The campaign got to ※approve§ articles in influential publications like NY Times, HuffPo, CNN, NBC, CBS, NYT, MSNBC, and Politico, showing a massive collusion with the mainstream media, who has hounded Trump relentlessly in an effort to distract from HRC＊s abysmal candidacy. ( source ) Through the treasure trove of Wikileaks emails, we can gain an accurate picture of how Hillary really feels about us all (spoiler: basket of deplorables, basement dwellers and right wing conspirators) ( source ) President Obama knew the whole time that her emails were not coming from the secure State Department server. Cheryl Mills wrote to John Podesta, ※ W e need to clean this up 每 he has emails from her 每 they do not say state.gov .§ You see, Obama＊s emails all have to be from§whitelisted§addresses. So someone, somewhere, added her nonsecure email to his whitelist. ( source ) \nAnd finally, here＊s the real reason that treacherous shrew is involved in politics. And let me tell you, it isn＊t because she yearns to make things better for anyone but herself. (emphasis mine.) \nAt the Goldman Sachs Builders and Innovators Summit, Clinton responded to a question from chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, who quipped that you ※go to Washington§ to ※make a small fortune.§ Clinton agreed with the comment and complained about ethics rules that require officials to divest from certain assets before entering government. ※ There is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives, § Clinton said. ( source ) Together, we cannot be ignored. I am on a mission between now and the Presidential Election on November 8th and I hope that you will join me. I am going to work day and night to provide the coverage that the mainstream media is not. It isn＊t until we combine all of our voices that we can make people listen to the scandals, the rigging, and the corruption, not only in this election but in the system in general.

    "text": "Posted on October 28, 2016 by Daisy Luther \nLet＊s talk about Wikileaks . \nFirst of all, the organization was founded by Julian Assange back in 2006. Their website explains what they are all about: \n※WikiLeaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war, spying, and corruption. It has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses.§ \nIn the 11 years that they＊ve been publishing documents, they have not been disproven a single time. Their record for authentication is perfect. (Learn more here and here .) \nSo this means that a person would be pretty silly to disregard anything in the reams of information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, the Clinton Foundation, and the political shenanigans that would put the Machiavellis to shame. \nHere are 21 of the most important things that have come out about Hillary Clinton, that unfortunately, no one is reporting on in the mainstream. In the interest of brevity, each topic has a link to an article that goes deeper into the leak. (In no particular order.) John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign had a nice cozy dinner with Peter Kadzik, one of the top officials in the Department of Justice＃the day after the Benghazi hearing . Kadzik＊s son also asked for a job on the Clinton campaign, and, the icing on the corruption cupcake? Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch, who famously met with Bill Clinton on her private plane right before Hillary＊s interrogation about Emailgate. ( source ) We all knew that the Clinton Foundation was just a way for the Clinton family to launder money, and now there＊s proof. Zero Hedge writes, ※＃today＊s Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band＊s firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family＊s private business endeavors.§ A pundit called this leak ※The Rosetta Stone of the Clinton Foundation,§ meaning that with this document, all of their shady financial dealings could be unraveled and translated. ( source ) Clinton is unable to speak for very long without a podium to lean on . Numerous leaked emails reference how certain interviews have to be kept short because she＊d be without one. And this article references a very interesting reason why this may be the case 每 surprisingly it isn＊t related to her health. ( source ) The leaks also show that Clinton intends to do her best to restrict the Second Amendment. Brian Fallon, the national press secretary for the Clinton campaign, wrote, ※ Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President 每 universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability .§ According to an analysis on The Daily Sheeple, ※Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook, Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold.§ ( source ) The campaign was concerned that the sexual escapades of Bill Clinton could be likened to those of another disgraced celebrity, Bill Cosby . Political operative Ron Klain sent an urgent email saying that Hillary should anticipate the following questions, § How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did? Is his conduct relevant to your campaign? You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused him? Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?§ ( source ) Clinton＊s campaign deliberately leaked an embarrassing photo of a swimsuit-clad Bernie Sanders to the press, ironically insinuating that it was proof he was bought off by Wall Street. Perez Hilton wrote, ※ Bernie Sanders lounges at elite Martha＊s Vineyard pool, summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists .§ ( source ) Clinton admitted she is out of touch with the middle class in a speech to Goldman-Black Rock in 2014. ※And I am not taking a position on any policy, but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. And I never had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean, were there really rich people, of course there were. My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We had accessible health care. We had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn＊t believe in mortgages. So I lived that. And now, obviously, I＊m kind of far removed because the life I＊ve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy , but I haven＊t forgotten it.§ ( source ) She made this rather NWO remark at a 2013 paid speech to Brazilian bank Banco Itau: ※ My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders , some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.§ ( source ) In a leak of yet another paid speech, this time to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013, Clinton said that Jordan and Turkey ※ can＊t possibly vet all those refugees so they don＊t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.§ Meanwhile, if Clinton has her way , we will be warmly welcoming 65,000 refugees a year, which makes Obama＊s 10,000 a year look like small potatoes. ( source ) Clinton blackmailed the Chinese by telling them that the US would base missiles in the region if they didn＊t exert some control over North Korean aggression. ※ So China, come on. You either control them or we＊re going to have to defend against them ,§ she purportedly told the audience at a Goldman Sachs conference in June 2013. ( source ) In May 2015, Clinton was no longer Secretary of State but was ready to announce she was running for President when she was invited to attend a summit in Morrocco. The implication from the leaked emails was that a $12 million ※donation§ from the king of Morocco was dependent on Clinton attending the summit. Human Abedin, usually loyal to her boss, had concerns . ※ If HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter. She created this mess and she knows it. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this,§ Abedin wrote to Robbie Mook in a November 2014 email. Incidentally, Clinton didn＊t attend. Bill and Chelsea went instead and the $12 million donation was not forthcoming. (source ) Podesta attacked Clinton＊s primary election rival Bernie Sanders for criticizing the Paris climate change agreement. ※ Can you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it? § said Podesta. ( source ) Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria . ※ My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,§ she told employees of the bank in South Carolina, which had paid her about $225,000 to give a speech. ※We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can＊t help themselves. They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we＊re doing and I want credit for it. § (source ) There is indeed a definite link between the Clinton campaign and what MSM is allowed to say. The campaign has colluded directly with media spokespersons that read like a Who＊s Who in American Media : Dan Merica from CNN, Haim Saban of Univision, John Harwood of CNBC and the NY Times, Rebecca Quick of CNBC, Maggie Haberman of NY Times and Politico, John Harris of Politico, Donna Brazile formerly of CNN, Roland Martin of TV-One, Marjorie Pritchard of The Boston Globe, and Louise Mensch of Heat Street. ( source ) As everyone knows, the DNC deliberately screwed Bernie Sanders out of the nomination ( Bonus: Wikileaks also released some of the DNC＊s voicemails on the topic ). There are emails that prove who is actually pulling HRC＊s puppet strings and that puppeteer is George Soros . The shadow government is not just a conspiracy theory 每 it really exists and Hillary＊s job is to keep George Soros happy. ( source ) Excerpts from her speeches to Wall Street read like a guide to two-faced treachery. In them, she clearly points out that sometimes you ※need§ to lie. ※If everybody＊s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.§ ( source ) Wikileaks emails show that back when she still worked for CNN and before she became an employee of the Clinton campaign, Donna Brazile gave Hillary the questions in advance for her ※impromptu§ CNN Town Hall questions. ( source ) The campaign got to ※approve§ articles in influential publications like NY Times, HuffPo, CNN, NBC, CBS, NYT, MSNBC, and Politico, showing a massive collusion with the mainstream media, who has hounded Trump relentlessly in an effort to distract from HRC＊s abysmal candidacy. ( source ) Through the treasure trove of Wikileaks emails, we can gain an accurate picture of how Hillary really feels about us all (spoiler: basket of deplorables, basement dwellers and right wing conspirators) ( source ) President Obama knew the whole time that her emails were not coming from the secure State Department server. Cheryl Mills wrote to John Podesta, ※ W e need to clean this up 每 he has emails from her 每 they do not say state.gov .§ You see, Obama＊s emails all have to be from§whitelisted§addresses. So someone, somewhere, added her nonsecure email to his whitelist. ( source ) \nAnd finally, here＊s the real reason that treacherous shrew is involved in politics. And let me tell you, it isn＊t because she yearns to make things better for anyone but herself. (emphasis mine.) \nAt the Goldman Sachs Builders and Innovators Summit, Clinton responded to a question from chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, who quipped that you ※go to Washington§ to ※make a small fortune.§ Clinton agreed with the comment and complained about ethics rules that require officials to divest from certain assets before entering government. ※ There is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives, § Clinton said. ( source ) Together, we cannot be ignored. I am on a mission between now and the Presidential Election on November 8th and I hope that you will join me. I am going to work day and night to provide the coverage that the mainstream media is not. It isn＊t until we combine all of our voices that we can make people listen to the scandals, the rigging, and the corruption, not only in this election but in the system in general.

    "text": "Posted on October 29, 2016 by Michael DePinto \nWho would have thought right? Hillary＊s campaign establishing what appears to be some very close ties with the largest social media company ( Facebook ) on the Internet, right in the midst of her presidential campaign? It＊s not enough that Hillary has Google hiding various stories from Clinton search queries, but it looks like she had to go and get Facebook on board to help her cheat as well. But should Trump supporters take any issue with that? \nSure, there＊s been issues in the past with Facebook banning conservatives for merely looking at their monitors the wrong way, but all that changed this week right? If you recall, earlier this week we learned that despite donating huge amounts of money to Hillary＊s campaign, allegedly Mark Zuckerberg betrayed Hillary Clinton, and actually jumped on board the Trump Train ＃ or is there more to this? In the video below I dig a bit deeper into both these stories＃ \nEmails Show Connection Between Facebook Executive, Clinton Campaign \n＃ kept the interactions with Clinton private ＃ \nA new WikiLeaks email dump shows Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg eager and willing to be involved in helping Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton＊s campaign. \nSandberg＊s role in helping the research-driven Clinton campaign was revealed in a WikiLeaks email from Clinton aide Cheryl Mills. \n※I have arranged for Sheryl Sandberg and her researcher to be available on 5 March at 10 am to step through the research on gender and leadership by women,§ Mills wrote in a February 2015 email. \nTwo months after that meeting, Sandberg offered to do more for the campaign in response to an email from campaign chairman John Podesta expressing sympathy for the death of her husband. \n※I still want HRC to win badly ,§ Sandberg wrote in May 2015. ※I am still here to help as I can. She came over and was magical with my kids.§ \nFacebook has said that Sandberg was acting in a private capacity in sharing research with the Clinton campaign. Sandberg kept the interactions with Clinton private, and did not formally, publicly endorse Clinton until early 2016. \nHowever, she kept in touch with the campaign. In August 2015, she emailed Podesta offering to put him in touch with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , a staunch opponent of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump . \n※Mark is meeting with people to learn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action and it＊s hard to imagine someone better placed or more experienced than you to help him,§ she wrote. \n※He＊s begun to think about whether/how he might want to shape advocacy efforts to support his philanthropic priorities and is particularly interested in meeting people who could help him understand how to move the needle on the specific public policy issues he cares most about,§ she added. \n※He wants to meet folks who can inform his understanding about effective political operations to advance public policy goals on social oriented objectives (like immigration, education or basic scientific research),§ she wrote. \nThe WikiLeaks emails from Podesta＊s account imply a meeting was arranged later that month. \nSOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS ARE ACTUALLY GOVERNMENT CREATIONS: \nIf you doubt that the CIA made Google, and Google made the NSA, but you don＊t read the following: save your worthless drivel for someone who cares. If you don＊t have the facts presented, how can you presume to dispute then? Conversely, if you dispute the facts presented with evidence stacked higher than Mt. Everest, by all means＃ let＊s hear it, but support your opinions with FACTS, not platitudes.",

    "title": "Unprecedented letter from Chair of Joint Chiefs suggests U.S. military does not want a President Hillary",
    "text": "Posted on October 29, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn \nEarlier this week, on October 24, 2016, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford sent a fascinating piece of communication, titled ※ Upholding Our Oath ,§ to every member of the U.S. Armed Services. \nNote: General Joseph Dunford Jr. , 60, was the 36th Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. Nominated by Obama, Dunford became the 19th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on October 1, 2015. \nThis is what Gen. Dunford wrote : \n※As the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff＃as our country again prepares for a peaceful transfer of power to a new administration, I write to share my views regarding our mutual obligations as military professionals and rights as citizens during this election season. \nEvery service member swears ※to support and defend the Constitution of the United States§ and to ※bear true faith and allegiance to the same.§ This oath is embedded in our professional culture and underpins the values that shape and define our all-volunteer force. Beginning with General George Washington resigning his military commission, our deliberate and disciplined commitment to upholding the principle of civilian control of the military underpins not only our warrior ethos but also the expectations of how we conduct ourselves while in uniform. \nWhile we must always safeguard our professional integrity, extra vigilance is required during any political transition. Our individual and collective obligation during this election season is twofold. First, we must recognize that we have one Commander in Chief, and until authority is transferred on January 20, 2017, the Joint Force must remain clearly focused on and responsive to the existing National Command Authority. Second, the Joint Force must conduct itself in such a way that the new administration has confidence that it will be served by a professional, competent, and apolitical military. This is especially important in the context of delivering the best military advice. \nEvery member of the Joint Force has the right to exercise his or her civic duty, including learning and discussing?〞?even debating?〞?the policy issues driving the election cycle and voting for his or her candidate of choice. Provided that we follow the guidance and regulations governing individual political participation, we should be proud of our civic engagement. What we must collectively guard against is allowing our institution to become politicized , or even perceived as being politicized, by how we conduct ourselves during engagements with the media, the public, or in open or social forums. \nWe are living in the most volatile and complex security environment since World War II. Whether confronting violent extremist organizations seeking to destroy our way of life or dealing with state actors threatening international order, threats to our national security require a Joint Force that is ready, capable, and trusted. To that end, I have a duty to protect the integrity and political neutrality of our military profession. But this obligation is not mine alone. It belongs to every Soldier, Marine, Sailor, Airman, and Coastguardsman. Thank you for joining me in honoring our history, our traditions, and the institutions of the U.S. Armed Forces by upholding the principle of political neutrality .§ \nEven without reading between the lines, General Dunford clearly has concerns about politicization of the military and its obligation and commitment to political neutrality and noninterference in politics. That the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff must remind members of the Armed Forces that they must ※uphold§ their oath both suggests and implies that the opposite is going on, i.e., the military is politicized and there are fears that it will intervene in civilian politics. \nIf this pic (below) of a young U.S. Marine is any indication, Gen. Dunford has good reasons to issue the ※Upholding Our Oath§ communication. \nA year ago, a Rasmussen Reports national survey of active and retired military personnel found that only 15% had a favorable opinion of Hillary Clinton, with just 3% who viewed her very favorably. A staggering 81% had an unfavorable opinion of her , including 69% who had a very unfavorable view of her. \nA similar survey today is sure to find even higher unfavorable ratings for Hillary among those whom she would command as their Commander in Chief. \nH/t GiGi and TruthFeedNews",

    "title": "Will Barack Obama Delay Or Suspend The Election If Hillary Is Forced Out By The New FBI Email Investigation?",
    "text": "Posted on October 29, 2016 by Michael Snyder \nJust when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a game changer into the mix . On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton＊s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails ※did not come from her private server§, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the ※emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry§, and according to some reports there may be ※potentially thousands§ of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? \nLet＊s take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ \nAfter recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ※appear to be pertinent§ to the email probe. \n※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,§ Comey wrote the chairmen. ※I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.§ \nAt this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton＊s closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton＊s Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ \nWe don＊t know what this means yet except that it＊s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that＊s where we are＃ \nIs it a certainty that we won＊t learn before the election? I＊m not sure it＊s a certainty we won＊t learn before the election. \nOne thing is, it＊s possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ \nIf the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? \nIt is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. \nSo those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. \nBut if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year＊s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group＊s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nIt would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. \nIn such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be ※fair§ until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. \nMeanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. \nAnd CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ \nAn artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. \nMogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai.

    "text": "Posted on October 29, 2016 by Michael DePinto \nWho would have thought right? Hillary＊s campaign establishing what appears to be some very close ties with the largest social media company ( Facebook ) on the Internet, right in the midst of her presidential campaign? It＊s not enough that Hillary has Google hiding various stories from Clinton search queries, but it looks like she had to go and get Facebook on board to help her cheat as well. But should Trump supporters take any issue with that? \nSure, there＊s been issues in the past with Facebook banning conservatives for merely looking at their monitors the wrong way, but all that changed this week right? If you recall, earlier this week we learned that despite donating huge amounts of money to Hillary＊s campaign, allegedly Mark Zuckerberg betrayed Hillary Clinton, and actually jumped on board the Trump Train ＃ or is there more to this? In the video below I dig a bit deeper into both these stories＃ \nEmails Show Connection Between Facebook Executive, Clinton Campaign \n＃ kept the interactions with Clinton private ＃ \nA new WikiLeaks email dump shows Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg eager and willing to be involved in helping Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton＊s campaign. \nSandberg＊s role in helping the research-driven Clinton campaign was revealed in a WikiLeaks email from Clinton aide Cheryl Mills. \n※I have arranged for Sheryl Sandberg and her researcher to be available on 5 March at 10 am to step through the research on gender and leadership by women,§ Mills wrote in a February 2015 email. \nTwo months after that meeting, Sandberg offered to do more for the campaign in response to an email from campaign chairman John Podesta expressing sympathy for the death of her husband. \n※I still want HRC to win badly ,§ Sandberg wrote in May 2015. ※I am still here to help as I can. She came over and was magical with my kids.§ \nFacebook has said that Sandberg was acting in a private capacity in sharing research with the Clinton campaign. Sandberg kept the interactions with Clinton private, and did not formally, publicly endorse Clinton until early 2016. \nHowever, she kept in touch with the campaign. In August 2015, she emailed Podesta offering to put him in touch with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , a staunch opponent of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump . \n※Mark is meeting with people to learn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action and it＊s hard to imagine someone better placed or more experienced than you to help him,§ she wrote. \n※He＊s begun to think about whether/how he might want to shape advocacy efforts to support his philanthropic priorities and is particularly interested in meeting people who could help him understand how to move the needle on the specific public policy issues he cares most about,§ she added. \n※He wants to meet folks who can inform his understanding about effective political operations to advance public policy goals on social oriented objectives (like immigration, education or basic scientific research),§ she wrote. \nThe WikiLeaks emails from Podesta＊s account imply a meeting was arranged later that month. \nSOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS ARE ACTUALLY GOVERNMENT CREATIONS: \nIf you doubt that the CIA made Google, and Google made the NSA, but you don＊t read the following: save your worthless drivel for someone who cares. If you don＊t have the facts presented, how can you presume to dispute then? Conversely, if you dispute the facts presented with evidence stacked higher than Mt. Everest, by all means＃ let＊s hear it, but support your opinions with FACTS, not platitudes.",

    "title": "Comment on Unprecedented letter from Chair of Joint Chiefs suggests U.S. military does not want a President Hillary by ConservativeSenior",
    "text": "Posted on October 29, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn \nEarlier this week, on October 24, 2016, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford sent a fascinating piece of communication, titled ※ Upholding Our Oath ,§ to every member of the U.S. Armed Services. \nNote: General Joseph Dunford Jr. , 60, was the 36th Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. Nominated by Obama, Dunford became the 19th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on October 1, 2015. \nThis is what Gen. Dunford wrote : \n※As the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff＃as our country again prepares for a peaceful transfer of power to a new administration, I write to share my views regarding our mutual obligations as military professionals and rights as citizens during this election season. \nEvery service member swears ※to support and defend the Constitution of the United States§ and to ※bear true faith and allegiance to the same.§ This oath is embedded in our professional culture and underpins the values that shape and define our all-volunteer force. Beginning with General George Washington resigning his military commission, our deliberate and disciplined commitment to upholding the principle of civilian control of the military underpins not only our warrior ethos but also the expectations of how we conduct ourselves while in uniform. \nWhile we must always safeguard our professional integrity, extra vigilance is required during any political transition. Our individual and collective obligation during this election season is twofold. First, we must recognize that we have one Commander in Chief, and until authority is transferred on January 20, 2017, the Joint Force must remain clearly focused on and responsive to the existing National Command Authority. Second, the Joint Force must conduct itself in such a way that the new administration has confidence that it will be served by a professional, competent, and apolitical military. This is especially important in the context of delivering the best military advice. \nEvery member of the Joint Force has the right to exercise his or her civic duty, including learning and discussing?〞?even debating?〞?the policy issues driving the election cycle and voting for his or her candidate of choice. Provided that we follow the guidance and regulations governing individual political participation, we should be proud of our civic engagement. What we must collectively guard against is allowing our institution to become politicized , or even perceived as being politicized, by how we conduct ourselves during engagements with the media, the public, or in open or social forums. \nWe are living in the most volatile and complex security environment since World War II. Whether confronting violent extremist organizations seeking to destroy our way of life or dealing with state actors threatening international order, threats to our national security require a Joint Force that is ready, capable, and trusted. To that end, I have a duty to protect the integrity and political neutrality of our military profession. But this obligation is not mine alone. It belongs to every Soldier, Marine, Sailor, Airman, and Coastguardsman. Thank you for joining me in honoring our history, our traditions, and the institutions of the U.S. Armed Forces by upholding the principle of political neutrality .§ \nEven without reading between the lines, General Dunford clearly has concerns about politicization of the military and its obligation and commitment to political neutrality and noninterference in politics. That the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff must remind members of the Armed Forces that they must ※uphold§ their oath both suggests and implies that the opposite is going on, i.e., the military is politicized and there are fears that it will intervene in civilian politics. \nIf this pic (below) of a young U.S. Marine is any indication, Gen. Dunford has good reasons to issue the ※Upholding Our Oath§ communication. \nA year ago, a Rasmussen Reports national survey of active and retired military personnel found that only 15% had a favorable opinion of Hillary Clinton, with just 3% who viewed her very favorably. A staggering 81% had an unfavorable opinion of her , including 69% who had a very unfavorable view of her. \nA similar survey today is sure to find even higher unfavorable ratings for Hillary among those whom she would command as their Commander in Chief. \nH/t GiGi and TruthFeedNews",

    "title": "Comment on Will Barack Obama Delay Or Suspend The Election If Hillary Is Forced Out By The New FBI Email Investigation? by Dennis Paul Habern",
    "text": "Posted on October 29, 2016 by Michael Snyder \nJust when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a game changer into the mix . On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton＊s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails ※did not come from her private server§, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the ※emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry§, and according to some reports there may be ※potentially thousands§ of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? \nLet＊s take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ \nAfter recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ※appear to be pertinent§ to the email probe. \n※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,§ Comey wrote the chairmen. ※I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.§ \nAt this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton＊s closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton＊s Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ \nWe don＊t know what this means yet except that it＊s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that＊s where we are＃ \nIs it a certainty that we won＊t learn before the election? I＊m not sure it＊s a certainty we won＊t learn before the election. \nOne thing is, it＊s possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ \nIf the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? \nIt is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. \nSo those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. \nBut if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year＊s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group＊s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nIt would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. \nIn such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be ※fair§ until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. \nMeanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. \nAnd CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ \nAn artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. \nMogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. \nThe AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. \nWithout Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. \nSo if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. \nAt this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.

    "text": "Carey Wedler | ANTIMEDIA \nOver the course of the 2016 presidential election, Americans who rail against Hillary Clinton have condemned the media＊s bias in her favor 〞 and rightfully so. Clinton has effectively infiltrated the corporate news media 〞 whose parent companies often donate to her 〞 with the deliberate intent of bolstering her own chances at the presidency. \nBut as this nefarious behavior continues to come to light through hacks and leaks, another powerful sphere of media influence has quietly placed its resources behind Hillary Clinton 每 and hardly anyone is talking about it. \nThough outrage over Clinton＊s corporate sponsors usually focuses on her support from banking giants like Goldman Sachs , Citibank, JP Morgan, and other reviled companies, corporate Hollywood has collectively supplied her campaign with far more cash than these banks. \nWhen people think of Hollywood＊s support for a political campaign, their minds tend to focus on the entertainment industry＊s most visible figures 〞 celebrities. From George Clooney , Katy Perry, and Leonardo DiCaprio to Justin Timberlake, Reese Witherspoon, Steven Spielberg, Beyonce, and Jay-Z, the celebrity consensus this year has settled on Clinton. \nBut underneath the stars＊ ＆progressive＊ choice is an intentional, systematic machine working in Hillary＊s favor, and it mirrors other conglomerated industries that have aligned behind her. Moguls with Millions (and Billions) Back Hillary and the Clinton Family \nThe first layer of Clinton＊s corporate Hollywood allegiance is rather simple to peel back, simply because Hillary＊s top industry donors make no secret of their support. \nEarlier this year, George Clooney held a $100,000-a-plate fundraiser for Clinton, one that earned $15 million dollars 〞 far more than Goldman Sachs has collectively donated to her campaign. The actor＊s event raised money for the Hillary Victory Fund, which was recently revealed to be an avenue for maxed out donors to contribute more than the allowable amount. The Victory Fund has also been criticized for hoarding money for Hillary that was supposed to go to state Democratic parties. \nClooney teamed up with one of corporate Hollywood＊s most powerful executives, Jeffrey Katzenberg, for this fundraiser. Katzenberg rose to prominence at Walt Disney in the 1990s, where he helmed some of the millennial generation＊s favorite childhood films: Beauty and the Beast , Aladdin , the Lion King , and the Little Mermaid were all products of Katzenberg＊s leadership. \nSeveral years later, he partnered with Steven Spielberg (also a longtime Clinton supporter) and David Geffen, a music mogul, to create Dreamworks Animation. Katzenberg was the top bundler for Barack Obama in 2012 and also funded him in 2008, so it＊s unsurprising the president takes his phone calls. Further, Katzenberg＊s right-hand man, Andy Spahn, visited the White House almost 50 times during Obama＊s first term, Mother Jones reported at the time, enjoying a close relationship with the president 〞 and some economic benefits. \nKatzenberg, who recently earned $391 million on the sale of Dreamworks to Comcast, has donated at least $1 million to Clinton＊s campaign this election season. \nThen there＊s billionaire Haim Saban, the staunchly pro-Israel entertainment mogul behind the original Power Rangers series. He is Clinton＊s top individual donor, besting Katzenberg, with at least $6.4 million in donations to her campaign. He has contributed $15 million to the Clinton Foundation, and his wife, Cheryl, serves on the board. \nSaban has supported the Clintons since the 1990s, and during Bill＊s time in office, he enjoyed the business perks of being friends with the president of the United States, as Mother Jones has detailed . His investments are tied to Wall Street, and he has also enjoyed Clinton＊s condemnation of Boycott, Sanction, Divest, a nonviolent, market-based global protest movement challenging Israel＊s occupation of Palestine. \nBoth men, therefore, know well the perks of having friends in high places 〞 and both are some of the top donors of any candidate in the 2016 race. But their very public〞 and lavish 〞 support barely scratches the surface of the real machinations taking place between Hollywood＊s corporate underbelly and its stake in American politics. The Studio Lobby \nMost people, if they＊ve heard of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) at all, know it as the organization that rates films. It＊s the familiar, almost comforting disclaimer that appears before a trailer or film, ranking it G, PG, PG-13, R, or in some cases, NC-17. \nThough the organization has its roots in the 20th century, founded as an effort to self-regulate their content, more than anything, it is corporate Hollywood＊s lobby. The MPAA represents 20th Century Fox (owned by Rupert Murdoch＊s News Corp.), Warner Brothers (owned by Time Warner), Disney, Universal (owned in part by Comcast), Sony Pictures, and Paramount Pictures (News Corp, Time Warner, and Comcast have all contributed to the Clinton Foundation). \nFor some, it＊s difficult to place corporate Hollywood in the same category as more reviled industries like banking, weapons manufacturing, or pharmaceuticals . This is likely, at least in part, because they deliver one of America＊s favorite pastimes 〞 entertainment. Yet the revolving door is strong, as is the MPAA＊s political foundation. \nIn fact, the MPAA＊s longest running chairman was Jack Valenti , who served as an advisor to Lyndon B. Johnson before taking over the lobbying group. By 2011, former senator and presidential candidate, Chris Dodd, had taken the reins. \nDodd, who makes $3 million a year working as the organization＊s top lobbyist, takes his job seriously. As the Los Angeles Times reported , Dodd has increased lobbying funds and efforts in Congress. ※ We＊ve had a hundred meetings with new members of Congress since November ,§ he told the publication last year. \nDodd is a Clinton supporter. He officially endorsed her earlier this year. \nDisney chairman Bob Iger is also a huge Clinton supporter and member of the MPAA. Alongside Saban, Iger hosted a Hollywood fundraiser for her in August and held a meeting with Tim Kaine, Clinton＊s running mate, in September. \nOn that same trip, Kaine met with Warner Brothers executive Kevin Tsujihara, who donated to Hillary Clinton＊s Victory Fund this year. He met with Fox Television executive Dana Walden, who also donated to Clinton. He also met with Kevin Reilly, an executive at Turner, which is owned by Time Warner, which owns Warner Brothers and CNN , an outlet condemned for heavily favoring Clinton this election cycle. Perhaps these private meetings were about gun control and equal rights. Or, perhaps, Kaine and the executives discussed business interests. \nEither way, the paper trail gets more decisive 〞 and more revealing. What is the MPAA Hoping to Achieve? \nMPAA members Disney and Sony have independently advocated for the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal , the globally loathed trade agreement criticized for granting carte blanche to corporations and stripping nations of their sovereignty. Disney has even prodded its employees to contribute lobbying funds in support of the agreement. Fox, Disney, Time Warner, Comcast, and other media companies have lobbied in favor of TPP . \nOne of TPP＊s most dangerous provisions is its intent to regulate copyright and intellectual property in favor of corporations 每 one of corporate Hollywood＊s main objectives. \nDodd is, unsurprisingly, a proponent of internet censorship legislation, which corporate Hollywood invariably backs in its attempts to preserve its copyright profits. Hollywood studios have been some of the biggest proponents of heavy internet regulation (with regard to copyright) and have waged campaigns against online piracy. The MPAA＊s website claims ※the most serious threat§ to the film industry is online copyright theft. \nIt makes sense, then, that the MPAA would be a member of the U.S. Business Coalition for TPP . This massive trade group spent $658 billion dollars on lobbying in 2014, according to Common Cause, a left-leaning nonprofit lobbying organization. The coalition includes members like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Dow Chemical , Pfizer , GlaxoSmithKline , Boeing , and Viacom (another media behemoth). Interestingly, the coalition＊s website no longer lists its members, though Anti-Media easily accessed an archived version of that information. \nThese corporations, or their employees, have also donated funds to Hillary Clinton in one way or another, often via the Clinton Foundation, which has been documented to issue favors to entities that contribute funds. Dozens of media corporations have donated to the foundation. \nAnd 〞 surprise, surprise 〞 the only presidential candidate the MPAA has contributed to in 2016 is ＃ Hillary Clinton. \nWhile it＊s certainly the case that Hollywood executives lean liberal and many undoubtedly support Clinton due to a misguided moral imperative to stop Donald Trump, it would be naive to presume this is the only dynamic at play. \nThis dynamic is evident in a letter from MPAA chief counsel Steven Fabrizio to Disney＊s Alan Braverman, among others, assuring them of his efforts to pass the bill. ※ Finally, in regard to trade ,§ he wrote , ※ the MPAA/MPA with the strong support of your studios, continue to advocate to governments around the world about the pressing need for strong pro-IP trade policies such as TPP and the proposed EU/US trade agreement (TTIP). § \nBraverman donated to Clinton this year. Infiltrating the DNC Platform Drafting Committee \nMost damning is the fact that one MPAA lobbyist, former California congressman Howard Berman, ended up on the drafting committee for the Democratic platform this year (throughout the course of his political career, some of his top donors were Hollywood studios). \nAccording to an email released by Wikileaks, Berman met with now-disgraced former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in May of this year 〞 two months before he helped draft the platform. She appointed him to the platform drafting committee. \nThat platform was widely criticized for refusing to condemn and reject TPP outright, as Bernie Sanders and his camp attempted to do. Berman helped vote down language against TPP. \n※But Hillary opposes TPP!§ some might argue. Indeed, after claiming it was set to be the ※gold standard§ of trade agreements, she changed her mind and said she opposed it. But a leak from the recently released John Podesta batch showed there is a very strong chance she will change her mind, again, once elected. And considering Donald Trump＊s anti-trade deal rhetoric against both NAFTA and TPP (not to mention his incendiary rhetoric), it makes little sense for corporate Hollywood to back Trump 〞 even if they＊re partly responsible for his meteoric rise via the Apprentice . \nIn a vein similar to Berman＊s, a former MPAA (and Disney, and Dow, and Citigroup) lobbyist, Jose Villareal, now serves as the Clinton campaign＊s treasurer. \nThough there is no smoking gun proving corporate Hollywood is backing Clinton with the express intent of ensuring passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it＊s telling that the MPAA＊s homepage is a tribute to TPP (and, naturally, themselves). It＊s telling that the organization donated to only one presidential candidate. It＊s telling that executives within these corporations are supporting Clinton while the companies they represent heavily back TPP 〞 and in many cases, Clinton. It＊s telling that their parent corporations, like News Corp and Time Warner , are backing her 〞 and the TPP. \nConsidering six corporations control 90% of media in the United States and Clinton continually proves her loyalties to big business, it＊s hardly surprising she＊s the choice of corporate Hollywood. And it＊s likely they＊ll expect favors in return. \nAs Dodd said following President Obama＊s rejection of SOPA and PIPA following public outcry in 2012: \n※Candidly, those who count on quote ＆Hollywood＊ for support need to understand that this industry is watching very carefully who＊s going to stand up for them when their job is at stake＃Don＊t ask me to write a check for you when you think your job is at risk and then don＊t pay any attention to me when my job is at stake.§",

Corrine brown＊s trial has been delayed to April 2017, She should be in jail before May 2017. ron_baker \nI am not doubting these examples of vote changing, but I am at a loss on how one ＆knows＊ their vote was changed. Is there a tally on the machine? My township＊s machines have a paper ballot that feeds into a machine that reads the marked boxes.

When you get to the final page you may review your entire ballot, when you see the error it clearly tells you what to do to correct it. \nGenerally these issues happen because the voter isn＊t focused on what they＊re touching on the screen and it＊s most often with first time voters or those who have difficulty using an electronic tablet. misterdawg \nThis isn＊t BS, It happen to me when John McCain was running against Obuma. I voted a straight GOP ticket and when it came up to vote, It was changed to all Democrats, I had it changed and when we got home, I told my wife that I guess I had made a mistake and she told me that our son＊s vote had been changed also and he had caught it to, before he had push the vote button. They have stole the last two elections I believe and are trying to steal this one too. The corrupt News Media, is in the tank for the crooked Democrats.

    "text": "If you signed up for Obamacare, you＊ve been screwed. \nIf you didn＊t sign up and opted to pay the penalties , you＊ve been screwed. \nIf you didn＊t sign up, didn＊t pay penalties, and stuck with your original insurance company, you＊ve been screwed. \nIf you didn＊t sign up, didn＊t pay penalties, and paid cash for medical care, you＊ve been screwed. \nEvery person in America has been affected, regardless of what you did or did not do. \nThat＊s because the Affordable Care Act irrevocably ruined our access to medical care at an affordable price in this country. In the mere span of 4 years, the prices have skyrocketed and many families have to pay more in monthly premiums than they pay on their mortgages. Meanwhile, medical costs have been driven up to astronomical prices, making it nearly impossible to pay out-of-pocket for care. \nAnd these premiums? They are for the crappiest coverage you can imagine. Some families pay $1500-2000 a month for 60% coverage after they pay the $5000 deductible. That＊s nearly $20,000 per year before Obamacare pays for a penny of their costs. \nAnd now＃now that insurance companies have gone belly up when they were forced to become a part of the ※exchange,§ medical costs are skyrocketing, doctors won＊t see patients who aren＊t ※covered,§ employers stopped offering insurance as a benefit, and people lost their jobs due to Obamacare costs＃ \nThe whole thing is failing. Even President Obama has admitted it . And now we have proof that it was planned that way. \nBut that isn＊t the worst of it. The worst of it is that this program was designed to fail and steer us into single payer healthcare, where a government entity can decide what procedures will or will not be covered. They＊ll decide who is deserving of cancer treatment and who is not. They＊ll mandate things like flu shots and childhood vaccines. \nOne of the recent Wikileaks shows that Hillary Clinton knew this and was complicit. \nMelissa Dykes of The Daily Sheeple wrote : \nIn an email thread dated September 26, 2015 between Hillary and her senior policy adviser Ann O＊Leary titled ※Memo on Cadillac Tax for HRC,§ Hillary wrote, ※Given the politics now w bipartisan support including Schumer, I＊ll support repeal w ＆sense of the Senate＊ that revenues would have to be found. I＊d be open to a range of options to do that. But we have to be careful that the R version passes which begins the unraveling of the ACA .§ \n※Which begins the unraveling of the Affordable Care Act.§ \nA Democrat supporting Republican legislation to destroy Obamacare on purpose. How many millions have they raked in on this deal and bilked the American people for in Obamacare penalties because they can＊t afford the ※affordable§ health care? And the American people will look at this like a ※victory§ when it does unravel, even though it has been the plan all along. \nHillary Clinton, that savior of woman and children, knew that this would fail . She is supporting the legislation to destroy it, leaving everyone in America at the mercy of the horrible replacement that she will dream up to redistribute wealth and deal the death blow to the already-struggling middle class. \nMark my words, as bad as this disaster is, it is only going to get worse.

    "title": "Will Michelle Obama Be The Replacement Nominee If The FBI Email Investigation Ends Hillary Clinton＊s Campaign?",
    "text": "Posted by Michael Snyder \nI realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre, but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen. We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. \nIn fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled ※ Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside ※＃ \nSo what should the Democrats do now? \nIf ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: \nThey would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. \nDemocrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. \nBut what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year＊s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group＊s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nSo if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. \nWho would they choose? \nLet＊s take a look at the top five options＃ \n#1 Tim Kaine \nHe would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton＊s running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. \nAnd at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. \nSo to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. \n#2 Joe Biden \nVice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run ＃ \nVice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. \nBiden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton＊s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. \nBut according to the vice president, the short answer is ※no.§ The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. \nUnfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. \nBiden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn＊t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. \nBiden would probably represent the ※safest§ choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. \n#3 Bernie Sanders \nBernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. \nFirst of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. \nSecondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. \nThirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be ※another McGovern§ and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. \nSo even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. \n#4 Elizabeth Warren \nElizabeth Warren would be very popular with the ※Bernie Sanders§ wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. \nSo she is definitely a possibility. \nBut she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as ※another McGovern§ because of her far left policies. \n#5 Michelle Obama \nOne recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. \nAnd these days Barack Obama＊s approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. \nSo the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. \nMichelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as ※the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign§ in a recent MSN article entitled ※ In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice ※＃ \nThe speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama＊s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. \n※When you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,§ said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. ※We know she didn＊t like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.§ \nIf I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. \nOf course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. \nAnd I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. \nIn the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. \nAnd if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down. \nMichael Snyder is the founder and publisher of The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream .

    "title": "The Deceptive Nature of Hillary Clinton is Right in Line with Communism",
    "text": "Posted by David Risselada \nMuch to the surprise of the American electorate, both on the right and left, the FBI is reopening it＊s investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s email scandal . Whether this will amount to anything meaningful, or it is simply a distraction is any body＊s guess. Many are speculating that this could be the issue which would cause President Obama to cancel the elections . In my recent article ※Corrupting One＊s Self is the Ultimate Morality in the Pursuit of Utopia,§ I discussed the possibility that the blatant corruption is deliberately being thrust in our face to create the necessary attitude for social change. This idea of course, is based on the writings of Alinsky and other ※social engineers§ skilled in the arts of propaganda and psychological manipulation. Looking at it from this perspective, cancelled elections are a possibility. The truth is, with Hillary Clinton you never know what to expect because she is operating from an ※ends justify the means mentality,§ and she is willing to do anything to see her dreams of a collectivized America move forward. \nAccording to Elizabeth Harrington from the Washington Free Beacon, the Clinton campaign began conducting focus groups to determine which approach Hillary should take concerning her run for the presidency. Hillary is diehard ideologue whose beliefs are right in line with Communists dictators like Stalin and Mao. She believes that ordinary people have no idea how to best conduct their personal business and the state should be involved in every aspect of our lives. The goal of these focus groups was to determine the attitudes of the electorate in order to mold her message and her personality into something they would vote for. Many people would attempt to ridicule and discredit anyone associating Hillary Clinton with communists because she comes across as compassionate and caring, always blaming everything on a vast, right wing conspiracy. \nThis has always been the modus operandi of the communist movement and it explains why so many young people have no idea about the atrocities committed under the regimes of communist rulers. Today＊s millennials are well aware of the holocaust and the millions of Jews murdered by Adolph Hitler. They may not however, know that Hitler murdered more than Jews. He started by eliminating the sick and disabled, then he murdered Christians, homosexuals and anyone else essentially, that didn＊t go along with his national socialism. The belief is that fascism is an extreme right wing world view. This explains the hostility towards today＊s conservative movement. They have been branded as fascists, when in fact, the truth is the exact opposite. On the true political scale, national socialism or fascism is to the right of communism, which represents complete state control, but it is still way left of center. A true, extreme right wing world view would be complete absence of government control over anything. With this being said, and understanding that the horrors of communism have all been forgotten simply because they are no longer being taught, the communists have been very successful in deceiving people because like Hillary Clinton, they pretend to be something they are not. \nMillions of young people in America, due to left wing indoctrination in our universities , are falling for the communist propaganda under the guise that communism is a more fair, compassionate system of economics. Left wing professors, refusing to acknowledge the failures of communism because they believe the right leader has not come along to implement it the right way, have failed to teach these young minds that the pursuit of total equality has led to the death of 100,000,000 people under communist controlled governments. Communists, believing not in God but in evolution and science, believe that man can be trained into submission and a refusal to accept communist ideals is in fact, a sign of mental deficiency. Therefore, it is justifiable to eliminate them. To understand this read ※Brainwashing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics.§ Communists also hide this belief by claiming their pursuit of equality is motivated by a pursuit of social and economic justice when in fact, it is motivated by a pure desire to control every aspect of human being. \nThe Black Book of Communism references the historical debate over the evil natures of both Communism and Nazism. Adolf Hitler, despite his cruelty was open about what his intentions were. He set out to create a perfect race that understood its role was to serve the state and nothing else. This isn＊t any different than the goals of communism truthfully, only insofar as communists seek to accomplish this on a global scale, (using the economic class issue as opposed to race) while national socialism focuses on achieving such a goal for the country itself. The communists on the other hand, as mentioned above, pretended to be compassionate about the poor and oppressed when in reality- they use these groups to organize for power while hiding behind the guise of compassion and the struggle to achieve social justice, while in reality-they are systematically imprisoning and murdering all that don＊t go along with their agenda. This, according to the Black Book of Communism, makes the communist ideology, if you could really assign degrees of evil, more evil than Nazism because of its deceptive nature. \nWe all know Hillary Clinton is a liar, and she wrote her college thesis on Saul Alinsky but do we know anything else about her? Given the fact that she conducted focus groups to help mold her campaign message it is obvious she is hiding something. Over the past several weeks we have seen references to leaked emails which show she has an obvious disdain for the average American and the common beliefs in liberty that most of us share. She has referred to many of us as ※irredeemable deplorables§ in an effort to brand us as the uncompassionate ones while pretending to care about the poor and so called oppressed. In fact, this is the whole strategy of the Democrat party because as we all know, they have taken a hard turn left and do not represent the views of most Americans. They will however, pretend to in order to get in office. What are her intentions if she were to assume office? Are the massive dehumanization campaigns where conservatives are labeled as fascists and whites as automatic racists a first step to a repeat of history where millions were slaughtered because they were deemed as undesirable by their own government? Looking at the deceptive nature of Hillary Clinton and the violent nature of the left, it sure seems like a distinct possibility. \nThe number of deaths under communist regimes from the Black Book of Communism Soviet Union- Vladimr Lenin and Joseph Stalin-20 million deaths China-Mao- 65 million deaths Vietnam- Ho Chi Mihn- 1 million deaths North Korea- 2 million deaths Cambodia- Pol Pot- 2 million deaths Eastern Europe- 1 million deaths Latin America- 150,000 deaths Africa- 1.7 million deaths Afghanistan (under soviet control) 1.5 million deaths \nThese are not deaths represented by wartime or revolutions, but by outright murder committed by evil men intent on creating perfect societies based on social justice and equality. I guess the question remains. Is man capable of bringing about a perfect society? \nCourtesy of Freedom Outpost \nDavid Risselada is a freelance writer and researcher.

    "text": "Posted by Michael Snyder \nIn the world of politics, the cover-up is often worse than the original crime. It was his role in the Watergate cover-up that took down Richard Nixon, and now Hillary Clinton＊s cover-up of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very, very long time. When news broke that the FBI has renewed its investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s emails , it sent shockwaves throughout the political world . But this time around, we aren＊t just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents. I haven＊t heard anyone talking about this, but if the FBI discovers that Hillary Clinton altered, destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the FBI during the original investigation, she could be charged with obstruction of justice. That would immediately end her political career, and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life. \nI have not seen a single news report mention the phrase ※obstruction of justice§ yet, but I am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading. The following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice ＃ \nWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. \nIf Hillary Clinton is sent to prison for 20 years, that would essentially be for the rest of her life. \nI have a feeling that the FBI is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in Huma Abedin＊s emails. But unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before November 8th, because according to the Wall Street Journal there are approximately 650,000 emails to search through＃ \nAs federal agents prepare to scour roughly 650,000 emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of Hillary Clinton ＊s email use, the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the Justice Department over how to investigate the Democratic presidential nominee. \nMetadata found on the laptop used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide, suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that Mrs. Clinton used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter. It will take weeks, at a minimum, to determine whether those messages are work-related from the time Ms. Abedin served with Mrs. Clinton at the State Department; how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the Clinton email probe. \nOf those 650,000 emails, an inside source told Fox News that ※ at least 10,000 § would be of interest to the investigation. \nAt this point, FBI officials have not even begun searching through the emails, because a search warrant has not been secured yet. The following comes from CNN ＃ \nGovernment lawyers haven＊t yet approached Abedin＊s lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search. Sources earlier told CNN that those discussions had begun, but the law enforcement officials now say they have not. \nEither way, government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer, the law enforcement officials said. \nBut the FBI is reportedly already searching a laptop that was co-owned by Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin, and no warrant was necessary for that search because Weiner is cooperating with the FBI. \nMany have been wondering why FBI Director James Comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day. Surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election, and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big. In addition, Comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the FBI. The following is an excerpt from a Daily Mail article that was written by Ed Klein, the author of a recently released New York Times bestseller about the Clintons entitled ※ Guilty As Sin ※＃ \n＆The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn＊t recommend an indictment against Hillary,＊ said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. \n＆Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,＊ said the source. ＆They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.＊ \nAccording to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. \nHe told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents.

    "title": "Comment on Will Michelle Obama Be The Replacement Nominee If The FBI Email Investigation Ends Hillary Clinton＊s Campaign? by marlene",
    "text": "Michael Snyder \nI realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre, but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen. We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. \nIn fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled ※ Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside ※＃ \nSo what should the Democrats do now? \nIf ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: \nThey would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. \nDemocrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. \nBut what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year＊s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group＊s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nSo if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. \nWho would they choose? \nLet＊s take a look at the top five options＃ \n#1 Tim Kaine \nHe would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton＊s running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. \nAnd at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. \nSo to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. \n#2 Joe Biden \nVice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run ＃ \nVice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. \nBiden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton＊s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. \nBut according to the vice president, the short answer is ※no.§ The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. \nUnfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. \nBiden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn＊t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. \nBiden would probably represent the ※safest§ choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. \n#3 Bernie Sanders \nBernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. \nFirst of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. \nSecondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. \nThirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be ※another McGovern§ and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. \nSo even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. \n#4 Elizabeth Warren \nElizabeth Warren would be very popular with the ※Bernie Sanders§ wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. \nSo she is definitely a possibility. \nBut she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as ※another McGovern§ because of her far left policies. \n#5 Michelle Obama \nOne recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. \nAnd these days Barack Obama＊s approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. \nSo the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. \nMichelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as ※the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign§ in a recent MSN article entitled ※ In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice ※＃ \nThe speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama＊s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. \n※When you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,§ said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. ※We know she didn＊t like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.§ \nIf I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. \nOf course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. \nAnd I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. \nIn the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. \nAnd if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down. \nMichael Snyder is the founder and publisher of The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream .

Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.§ Her conversation was secretly recorded. \nThe audio was never released, and according to Chomsky it has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. He claims his copy is the only copy and no one has heard it since 2006. He gave a copy of the audio to the Observer. During the recording, Hillary is allegedly heard about rigging the election. She says: ※I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.§ It shows she is willing to do whatever it takes to win. \nChomsky told the Observer he was taken aback that ※anyone could support the idea 每 offered by a national political leader, no less 每 that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.§ The Observer is owned by Donald Trump＊s son in law. \nHere is the audio recording: \nSign up to get alerts about Dennis Michael Lynch's upcoming Donald Trump film and breaking news.

    "text": "Home / News / Hillary Insisted America Fact Check Her, So We Did＃Here＊s 6 Huge Lies From The Debate Hillary Insisted America Fact Check Her, So We Did＃Here＊s 6 Huge Lies From The Debate fisher 4 mins ago News Comments Off on Hillary Insisted America Fact Check Her, So We Did＃Here＊s 6 Huge Lies From The Debate Hillary Insisted America Fact Check Her, So We Did＃Here＊s 6 Huge Lies From The Debate Hillary Clinton stood before millions of Americans last night and told numerous lies, then said things like ※Google it§, suggesting we fact check her＃so we did and found 6 major lies, plus others. FACT CHECK #1 每 Hillary Clinton claimed that Planned Parenthood ※provides cancer screenings§ and therefore should not be de-funded, in spite of controversy about abortion. Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE This is a repeated claim deployed in defense of Planned Parenthood, but it is not true, at least as regards breast cancer. As the left-leaning Washington Post ＊s fact-checker wrote in 2015: When Democratic lawmakers or other supporters assert that Planned Parenthood ※provides§ mammograms, this is highly misleading language because it could be interpreted to mean that the group directly administers the X-rays. The group does not ※provide§ mammograms. Rather, the situation is similar to other clinics where patients are referred to a licensed facility that can provide biopsies, X-rays or other specialized services. It is slightly more accurate to say that women have ※access§ to mammograms via Planned Parenthood, though it＊s still slippery language. FACT CHECK #2 每 Hillary Clinton responded to a question about Supreme Court and gun rights by saying, ※I support the Second Amendment.§ Fact-Check: FALSE When Clinton made this statement she was responding to a question about the District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) decision: a decision dealing with the foundations of the Second Amendment; the very roots of what it protects. In the Heller ruling, SCOTUS reaffirmed that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms. This decision has become a bulwark against leftists who have spent decades in academia, politics and journalism trying to persuade Americans that the Second Amendment protects a collective right. (If collective, the left could tie gun ownership to service in the militia and bar gun ownership for anyone save those who serve in the militia or today＊s military or police forces.) So Heller is crucial. In fact, it is so crucial that it is not be a stretch to say the entire Second Amendment rests on it. Yet Hillary disagrees the Heller ruling. Her spokesman Josh Schwerin said Hillary believes Heller was ※ wrongly decided .§ So how can a woman who does not believe in an ※individual§ right to keep and bear arms support the Second Amendment? She can＊t. Incidentally, Clinton made this point evident during the debate when she said her disagreement with the Heller decision was the way the SCOTUS applied the Second Amendment in that case. For those of you who may not know, Heller centered on Washington DC＊s gun ban每which was subsequently struck down via the SCOTUS decision. To oppose the application of the Second Amendment in Heller is to oppose the fact that a gun ban was overturned. That is not supporting the Second Amendment. FACT CHECK #3 每 Hillary Clinton said during the third presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday that she ※will not add a penny to the debt§ if elected president. Fact-Check: FALSE Indeed, Hillary Clinton＊s claim is not even close to true. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget predicts that under Clinton＊s policies , the debt would increase by $9 trillion over a decade. ※Clinton＊s plan would increase both spending and revenue,§ the Washington, D.C.-based independent non-profit＊s analyst said . ※Under our preliminary updated central estimate, she would increase primary spending by $1.65 trillion over the next decade, including about $500 billion of spending on college education, $300 billion each on paid family leave and infrastructure, and significant new health-related spending.§ FACT CHECK #4 每 Hillary Clinton claimed that ※33,000 people a year＃die from guns.§ Fact-Check: FALSE This is a claim Clinton often makes to make gun violence appear to be raging out of control; to justify the government stepping in with more rules and regulations to keep the American people safe. However, a Fact-Check shows Clinton＊s claim is not only false, but is exaggerated by 66 percent. She is using figures from 2013, and reporting them in a way that distorts what really happened with guns that year. Clinton first began making this claim in November 2015, repeated it in April 2016, and has since repeated it again and again. In April Breitbart News highlighted the method Clinton used to swell the numbers: In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 11,208 firearm-related homicides in the United States. An additional 505 accidental firearm-related deaths occurred in the US每a figure that pales in comparison to the 38,851 deaths by accidental poisoning or the 30,208 deaths caused by falls. So Clinton and gun control proponents who think like her increase these figures by adding in suicides. In this way, 11,713 firearm-related deaths每homicides and accidental deaths每quickly become 32,888 ※gun violence§ deaths in 2013 and an impetus for gun control. FACT CHECK #5 每 Hillary Clinton praised President Obama ＊s economic performance, adding: ※He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.§ Fact-Check: FALSE This repeated Democratic canard relies on fraudulent accounting that only starts more than halfway through Obama ＊s first year in office, after the $862 billion stimulus, the massive omnibus spending bill (※porkulus§), and the deployment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which was signed by Obama ＊s predecessor but for which he voted. As Breitbart News noted when President Obama claimed in January to have cut the deficit by ※almost three-quarters§: This is pure fiction. Obama has doubled the national debt, and it＊s not because he cut the deficit. Rather, he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in office每which he assigns, dishonestly, to the previous fiscal year, under George W. Bush. He ※cut§ (i.e. spent more gradually) from that spending, but only under protest, after Republicans took the House in 2010. The truth is that Obama vastly expanded the deficit in a doomed and ill-conceived experiment in Keynesian stimulus spending, much of which was wasted on priorities that helped Obama ＊s political supporters 〞 especially the public sector unions 〞 but did little for the economy. FACT CHECK #6 每 Hillary Clinton said ※We at the Clinton Foundation spend ninety percent 〞 ninety percent 〞 of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.§ Fact-Check: FALSE Indeed, Clinton＊s ※ninety percent§ claim is false according to her troubled charity＊s own t ax filings . Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute , Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large, and author of Clinton Cash said the Clinton Foundation has spent as little as six percent of its total income on actual charitable endeavors. ※If you actually look at the numbers of their filings and 990s, that＊s what it indicates,§ Schweizer said last month in an interview with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily . ※The Clinton Foundation will say, ＆We assisted or facilitated in 100,000 kids getting immunizations.＊ Well, okay, what does that mean? And they don＊t really tell you. They don＊t really explain to you how it works.§ ※So the number is absolutely correct, that six percent goes to other charities,§ Schweizer continued. ※The other 94 percent is in this stew of marketing, and management, and travel expenses, and sort of all these obscure things, that it＊s really hard to dissect what is the end result of that 94 percent being spent.§ What＊s more? Political analyst Sean Davis, the co-founder of The Federalist and a former adviser to Sen. Tom Coburn and Gov. Rick Perry, examined the Clinton Foundation＊s 2013 tax filings and found that ※ Hillary Clinton＊s non-profit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants.§ ※The Clinton Foundation spent nearly $8.5 million每10 percent of all 2013 expenditures每on travel,§ Davis contends . ※Nearly $4.8 million每5.6 percent of all expenditures每was spent on office supplies.§ (Source: Check out over 20 more Fact Checks at Breitbart) So there you have it, folks. It was hard to narrow it down to just 6, but these were among the biggest lies of the night.",

Before Hillary became Secretary of State, she had to sign an agreement with the Obama administration restricting the ability of the Clinton Foundation to accept foreign donations. In February of this year the Clinton Foundation admitted that the agreement had in fact been broken. \nNow it has been discovered that over half of non-government officials who met with Hillary while she was Secretary of State gave money to the Clinton Foundation. What they received in return is just one of the questions Hillary has refused to answer byavoiding the press for the past eight months. In newly released emails there are details of donors being granted access to ambassadors due to their interest in the region, the Foundation putting pressure on Hillary ＊s staff to hire a former employee, and the Clinton Global Initiative leader demanding a top Foundation donor be connected with the State Department. \nThis is beyond the appearance of a conflict and Americans have seen through the facade. A majority of voters say they believe Clinton gave special treatment to Foundation donors while she was Secretary of State. As the president of Judicial Watch accurately pointed out, ※There was no daylight between the two under Mrs. Clinton, and this was contrary to her promises.§ \nAfter ignoring previous ethics guidelines, the Clintons are now trying to reassure Americans by saying the Foundation will change if Hillary is elected. The last ditch effort to gloss over ethics violations and possibly cover up corruption within Hillary ＊s State Department is much too little and far too late. Americans are tired of being lied to by the Clintons. Since the American people have a right to a full view of Hillary ＊s record before they head to the polls, the Clinton Foundation should immediately release all of Hillary ＊s State Department emails.",

Catholic Church announces a major warning against Hillary Heisenberg 5 mins ago News Comments Off on Yikes! Catholic Church announces a major warning against Hillary \nA San Diego Catholic Church claims Hillary is doing the devils work. Reuters reported: A Roman Catholic church in San Diego told its parishioners the devil works through politicians like Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and warned that voting for Democrats is a ※mortal sin,§ according to local media and the church＊s website. The Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Old Town made the statements in its weekly leaflet to churchgoers, a copy of which remains on the church＊s website. The letter railed against issues like abortion and constraints on tax-exempt organizations from certain political activity, likening them to slavery. ※Satan has deceived many Christians to convert to worldly values from Christian ones,§ the Oct. 30 bulletin reads. ※The devil does this through the tactics outlined by Saul Alinsky with the outcome as Hillary Clinton has stated, ＆And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed,＊ to draw us away from God＊s teachings.§",

Reines, Clinton＊s longtime aide who served as her senior advisor while she was Secretary of State. \nIn the same email, Reines cryptically wrote about Clinton＊s email scandal that ※email retention = Benghazi.§ \nThe March 3, 2015 correspondence was posted by Wikileaks after the email was ostensibly captured in John Podesta＊s hacked gmail account. \nThe message was a response to a suggestion from Clinton＊s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, that Clinton make a joke about the email fiasco during a charity dinner later that day. This was two months before the State Department publicly released the first batch of Clinton＊s emails, messages which had previously been provided to the House Select Committee on Benghazi . \n※Greetings. I wanted to float idea of HRC making a joke about the email situation at the Emily＊s List dinner tonight. What do folks think about that?§ Palmieri asked, in an email to numerous Clinton confidantes, including Podesta and Reines. \n※Margolis and I discussed,§ replied Mandy Grunwald, a communications adviser to Clinton. ※We don＊t know what＊s in the emails, so we are nervous about this. Might get a big laugh tonight and regret it when content of emails is disclosed.§ \nThat＊s when Reines chimed in with his remarks: \nTrust me, most of the email themselves are funnier than any joke we can come up with. Read in total by America she would either win 49 states, or lose 49 states. I go back and forth. \nI＊m not hard over either way, but I would not make a joke just for the sake of making a joke, because email retention = Benghazi. \nBUT, if we could get some business done in a light way it＊s worth trying: signaling that she is more than fine with them making their way into the public domain. Because past the process stuff, next phase is content. And the assumption is that she did this secretly, hiding, etc. Simply not true. We can＊t jam State to release them at this point, but if Dan can think of a light way to say ※I am proud of the work we did at State and hopefully at some point everyone will be able to read what＊s in them as a way to better understand that work, but until then, I want to talk about＃§ Doesn＊t need to be at the top, could be at some natural point. \nThat＊s my strong vote since I think her expressing more than a willingness for them to be released into the wild is what＊s most important.",

    "text": "JUST IN: FBI Reopens Hillary Clinton Email Probe Please scroll down for video \nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has announced its plans to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s emails just 11 days before the presidential election, reigniting a massive controversy that has haunted the Clinton campaign for months. \nThree months after the investigation was closed, FBI director James Comey said he found more emails that were \"pertinent\" to the investigation of Ms Clinton＊s personal email server, which Ms Clinton had been accused of misusing during her tenure as secretary of state. \n※In previous congressional testimony I refer to the fact that the FBI has completed its investigation of former secretary Clinton＊s personal email server,\" Mr Comey said. \n\"Due to recent developments I am writing to supplement my previous testimony. Related Articles FBI Successfully Recovers Hillary Clinton＊s Deleted Emails \n\"In connection with an unrelated case the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent, and I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and I agreed the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\" \nHe said he \"cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant\", and did not say how long the investigation would take. \nThe new investigation is reportedly not related to WikiLeaks. \nThe email controversy has dogged Ms Clinton's campaign for months. \nShe repeatedly said she handed over 33,000 emails to the FBI and the Justice Department to determine whether she had sent or received top secret or classified information on an unsecured server. \nThe FBI also denied a \"quid pro quo\" arrangement with the state department to downgrade certain information in the emails from \"classified\" to \"unclassified\" . \nMr Comey told the Justice Department in July that although Ms Clinton had displayed \"extreme carelessness\" which could have lead to adversaries hacking her account, he did not recommend any criminal charges. \nThe Justice Department decided to clear the presidential nominee of all charges the same month. \nIt is not yet known where these new emails came from or what they say. The Clinton campaign has not yet commented. \nAs the news broke, Ms Clinton was flying to Iowa to speak alongside women's rights leaders at two rallies. \nAt a rally in New Hampshire, Donald Trump told the crowds: \"Hillary Clinton＊s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let take her criminal scheme into the oval office. \n\"I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to write the horrible mistake that they made.\" \nHe has previously said Ms Clinton should be behind bars and accused her of \"deleting thousands of emails\" to hide them from the FBI, which Ms Clinton denied. \nThe news was also jumped on by Republicans including house speaker Paul Ryan, who said Ms Clinton had \"nobody but herself to blame but herself\". \n\"She was entrusted with our nation's most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information,\" he said in a statement, renewing his call to exclude Ms Clinton from any classified briefings until the matter was \"fully resolved\". \nAlong with the investigation over her emails sent and received as secretary of state, the US government recently accused Russia of hacking emails from the Democratic National Convention, which exposed Ms Clinton's team's planned smear of former opponent Bernie Sanders.

    "text": "? Previous - Next ? Anonymous To Release The 33000 Deleted Hillary E-Mails Starting November 1st \nThe Internet hacking collective Anonymous are said to be behind the enormous hack of emails relating to the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. While it has been claimed in the mainstream media that hackers from within Russia were responsible for the hack, Anonymous have declared that these suspicions are complete without merit. A source from within the group has allegedly provided proof that Anonymous are in possession of the thirty-three thousand deleted emails. It has also been said that they intend to release all of them. \nIt has been claimed that the choice to release emails that would force the FBI to open a serious criminal investigation was a deliberate tactic on the part of hackers involved with the shadowy cyber-network. It is believed that the emails relate to the disgraced former politician Anthony Weiner and his sexual propositioning of an underage girl. The nature of Weiner＊s crime adds credence to the claims that Anonymous are behind the hack as they have a strong track record in aggressively exposing the crimes of sex offenders. \nThe source has claimed that the revelations will not end with Weiner. In the week leading up to the highly contentious presidential election, more emails will be released in batches, each containing sensational details supposedly relating to the criminal activity of those within Clinton＊s inner circle. A sneak preview of the revelations that are to suggest that they are potential ground breaking in nature. Apparently, the group has access to documents which attest to serious criminal activities including bribes and threats to both election officials and members of the media. Sources within Anonymous have claimed that these documents will certainly lead to criminal charges being leveled against further individuals within the Democratic Party . \nThe group has also given a tantalizing hint about the relationship between the Clinton Foundation, the White House and the Middle Eastern country of Qatar. It is alleged that the emails will show that the Clinton Foundation made a transfer of $1.8 billion to the incredibly wealthy country. There are also allusions to a palace being built there for a ＆high-ranking White House official.' As the group has also claimed that the sitting president Barrack Obama will feature heavily in the upcoming emails, it has been speculated as to whether the president himself is this ＆high ranking White House official.' \nThis article (Anonymous To Release The 33000 Deleted Hillary E-Mails Starting November 1st) is free and open source.

Contains images some viewers might find disturbing. \nHillary Clinton used her power within Obama's state department, to control money for ISIS terrorists, and then to try to cover up the exposure of these Swiss and other bank accounts used for this purpose. This testimony by an officer in charge of tracking terrorist financing, is confirmed with recently leaked information (by WikiLeaks and others). \n\"Accidental\" attacks by misused US aircraft have been happening, in a desperate attempt to break out the US armed and paid (directly and indirectly) ISIS forces from Aleppo, to prevent further evidence from being captured. Both Kurdish and Syrian government forces encircling ISIS in Aleppo have been thus attacked so far. And, the US-backed ISIS forces themselves, have been ruthlessly attacking civilians in surrounding areas, with the same objective - with the consequences seen here. Tags",

    "title": "Critical Developments-Wikileaks, Huma＊s Computer, Confirming Hillary Was Behind the Murder of Ambassador Stevens",
    "text": "Comments Wikileaks is about to confirm the story that The Common Sense Show told four years ago in that Ambassador Stevens was set up to die because his stories of gun-running, child trafficking and drug-running on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency in order to promote regime change in Libya using terrorists funded by these illegal activities, were leaking out and it was only a couple of months until the election. Ambassador Stevens had to be silenced. And Petraeus had to be put in a place where he was not forced to testify before Congress because he could not take the fifth before Congress. From Beforeitsnews: At the same time, Clinton was broadcasting Stevens whereabouts and she refused to provide the extra protection Stevens was so desperately requesting. Being that Stevens was working for the CIA, then head of the CIA, David Petraeus, would have known about Chris Stevens activities. To protect Obama＊s 2012 election, both Stevens and Petraeus had to be gone. People are asking me how I knew all of this four years ago and I say, ※I had a deep cover source from inside one of the military/intelligence services who wanted the real truth to be told. Somebody who knew this nation could not afford to let Clinton ever become President§. Now, I am getting confirmation from Wikileaks and others who have reached the same conclusion I did four years ago. Dear Mr. Hodges, This is to inform you that Wikileaks will soon, or has released Clinton emails which will demonstrate the following: The above is already appearing on the Internet in several places. It is clear that Putin would be a fool to allow Clinton and her gang of thugs to continue with their plan. Every time Clinton sags in the polls, she starts talking about 9/11. The evidence is beginning to line up that Clinton interests had motive to commit 9/11. No wonder Clinton tries to blame the Russians for everything, she is the main culprit on the world being brought to the precipice of World War III. It is a gratifying feeling when the dots start to connect. The Aaron Klein Revelations: Aaron Klein, the Breitbart Bureau Chief for Jerusalem revealed, in a Breitbart publication dated March 1, 2016, revealed that ※the email from April 10th, 2011, the State Department employee, Timmy Davis, forwarded an email to the server by Clinton＊s aide, Huma Abedin.§ Please note that the time of this revelation, Huma Abedin, was not yet a household name. The series of emails will eventually have catastrophic consequences for Ambassador Stevens. ※An email containing the whereabouts and plans of murdered U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens passed through Hillary Clinton＊s private server, dispatches released Monday in the final group of messages from Clinton＊s emails reveal.§ \nBelow are some examples of the allegations posed by Klein and these are not empty charges as Klein offered as proof, the following emails. \n※A March 27, 2011 email released last year was titled, ※Chris Stevens mission.§ It divulged: ※The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage offshore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days. \nAn April 8, 2011 email was forwarded to Clinton revealing the ※security situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as required.§ \nAn April 22, 2011 email revealed Stevens was on the road: ※I want to let you know about a temporary rotation in Benghazi. TNC Envoy Chris Stevens has been on the road since March 13, when he began his outreach mission, and has been in Benghazi since April 5.§ \nAn April 24, 2011 email has the exact time of a Stevens meeting: ※§Stevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving into a villa, but that is some way off.§ \nIf later emails are released, I have no doubt, that we will see that Clinton was transmitting Stevens location up until the time of the attack upon the Benghazi compound and this explains why some of these emails are not being released. However, at some point, they will see the light of day. \nThe release of travel information, in any form, is a felony! Remember, the Stevens travel plans are classified and they came from Clinton＊s private server. A casual Law and Order fan could make the causal connections between the release of these emails and Stevens death. This is absolute evidence that Clinton not only is guilty of multiple felonies, she is an accomplice to murder!",

Of course, Seagal quickly became the target of liberal fire for his comments, but he refused to break down. He particularly lost it when one Twitter user tried to argued that Hillary was the most capable for the presidency. ※Capable? Capable of leaving AMERICANS to die. Capable of disregarding law. Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,§ he argued. He then went on to address race relations in the United States, and the true role President Barack Obama has played in the social evolution of this country. ※Obama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,§ he wrote. Seagal concluded by pointing out the irony of the attacks he was receiving from liberals everywhere. ※Best thing in the world＃Making one statement about freedom and getting attacked by every Demo out there＃ #HYPOCRITICAL,§ he tweeted. ※An America without a democrat in the White House, is a SAFER America.§ What do you think of Seagal＊s comments?",

The picture is clear that most counties in America voted for Trump . \nSecondly, the media is also hiding from you that Trump CRUSHED Hillary in the Electoral College (EC). As of today, most if not all media outlets show that Trump won the election with only 279 EC votes. But the truth is Trump also won Michigan with 16 EC votes and Arizona with 11 EC votes for a total of 306 EC votes. Hillary only won 228 EC votes but it looks like she barely won New Hampshire which should put her at 232 EC votes. As a result, Trump won 57% of all EC votes. \nHIllary turned in the Democratic Party＊s worst Electoral College performance in 28 years. With only New Hampshire left to be called, Clinton has turned in the Democratic Party＊s worst Electoral College performance in 28 years pic.twitter.com/APU85Ty50q \n〞 Dan O＊Donnell (@DanODradio) November 9, 2016 \nThirdly, in total states it was a landslide. Trump won 31 states to 19 states won by Hillary or 62% of the states. \nThe mainstream will argue that Hillary beat Trump in the popular vote which appears accurate. According to the NYT she won 59,923,027 to Trump＊s 59,692,974 for a difference of only 230,053 or 0.4%. But in California and New York Hillary beat Trump by a combined 4 million votes. If not for these two huge liberal states, Hillary would have gotten shellacked in the popular voting as well. \nThe mainstream media will not tell you but Trump won BIGLY!",

    "text": "Email Print Democratic Vice President Joe Biden wants American women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy. ※If we just put all the women back to work, if they were able to afford childcare, we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent,§ he said. ※That＊s trillions of dollars over the next decade.§ Biden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. ※The state of our economy could be characterized by a single word: pitiful,§ he argued. ※We＊re still battling recession, I don＊t care what the official stats are saying, America is still in recession. And we＊re not doing anything about it.§ He added that it was ※lazy American women§ who brought about the downfall of the economy, because ※they sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them.§ ※I＊m not sure how exactly we got to this point, but we＊re here and we need to move. Like, yesterday,§ he said. ※Mark my words and mark them well,§ he addressed the crowd. ※Hillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, she＊s a woman herself and not just any woman; she＊s a self-made woman. So you better believe what she＊s saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.§ ※Second, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. She＊s been all that and she＊s learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add,§ Biden continued. ※Today＊s women are pampered and aren＊t used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own,§ the vice president said. ※They＊re too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is they＊ve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.§ ※Now, that＊s all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, it＊s the economy that＊s missing out on valuable workforce. And that＊s why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States.

    "text": "Email Print One of my top candidates for Attorney General just gave Hillary Clinton a little truth bomb for dinner. While appearing with Megyn Kelly and discussing the reopening of the FBI investigation against Hillary Clinton, Gowdy said Hillary＊s attitude and defensiveness is ※＃just too rich.§ In essence, she is getting exactly what she deserves＃ Gowdy stated something I commented on earlier in the day, stating, ※The same person who went to great lengths to make sure that these emails were private now, all of a sudden, wants it all made public.§ This is grandstanding by Hillary, nothing more. As an attorney, and as Secretary of State, Hillary knows the FBI CAN NOT release any information about an ongoing investigation. She also knows that due to the complexity of the case, it could take months before We the People hear anything from the FBI about this investigation. This is nothing Comey is doing to hurt her in the campaign or any type of conspiracy, this is just how the system works. The arrogance of Clinton is now demanding we get that information immediately, which would mean expediting her case and devoting thousands of extra man hours, probably all overtime, at tax payers expense! That, my friends, is what we would call privilege. And I don＊t want to hear her argument that because she is running for president she is entitled because We the People were also supposed to be entitled to a Secretary of State that was not corrupt! Hilary wrote this narrative on her own. She decided to use a private server for government communications, something NOBODY else in our government was doing or was allowed to do. She broke the rules, and now that there is an attempt to hold her accountable for it, she wants exceptions. Gowdy is right, this is rich, because if Hillary had simply followed the rules, she would not be in this mess in the first place! But, then again, there is a reason we have jails＃ because criminals never follow the rules! And Mr. Gowdy, if Hillary truly gets what she deserves, her address will be changed to one of those prisons very soon! What did you think of Gowdy＊s response to the reopening of the case against Hillary Clinton? Please share this story on Facebook and tell us because we want to hear YOUR voice!

    "text": "According to Conservative Daily Post: Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founders of ISIS. We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it. After all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done. Because of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed. An email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: ※Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region§ to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of ※providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.§ Citing the need to ※use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets,§ said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were ※important to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country.§ Odd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when Hillary＊s largest donations come from those two countries. In another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai, set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 ※birthday check.§ The email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would ※welcome [the Clinton Foundation＊s] suggestions for investments in Haiti 〞 particularly on education and health.§ Desai added that while Qatar had already ※allocated most of their $20 million ＃ [they were] happy to consider projects we suggest.§ Bill Clinton gets $1M from Qatar for his birthday. FYI: It's legal and common practice in Qatar for husbands to beat and rape their wives. pic.twitter.com/oGM2Z9JrVl \n〞 Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) October 13, 2016 We now see two more examples of the Clinton＊s acting corrupt and being intertwined with nations that fund ISIS. For those that do not see where the dots connect, let＊s simplify how this all worked for Hillary. Hillary, as Secretary of State, would sell terrorist nations large weapons deals only after they gave her a very generous donation to her ※foundation.§ These weapons, provided by Hillary and her State Department, then filtered down from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya, and so on to create, supply, and bolster terrorist groups. That is exactly how ISIS was created. But instead of blowing them up with an air assault, Hillary and Obama decided to leave ISIS alone. Why? Because ISIS being in the Middle East allows the Obama/Clinton machine to make millions in personal profits from these nations in a repetitive cycle of selling weapons. They are choosing personal gain over eliminating a terrorist group. Let that sink in. Why else have they not arrested Hillary for all of these crimes? The FBI would arrest you in a heartbeat if you went to Facebook right now to praise Allah and ISIS. It also speaks volumes as to why they are trying so hard to silence Julian Assange. If Julian Assange is lying, why are they trying so hard to silence him? \n〞 Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) October 23, 2016 The media remains silent on all of this. This would be plastered all over the news for months if a President Trump was exposed for this. Ignorant politicians are not the problem. The problem is that ignorant people keep voting for them every election. This is the exact reason we desperately need change in this country, and it starts with Donald Trump. People like Julian Assange have given up their lives to expose corruption in government and allowing Hillary Clinton to win this election makes all of his sacrifices meaningless. He has offered us a chance to revolt against our tyrannical government. Chances likes this do not occur often, and if we do not seize the opportunity, we will suffer another four years of suppression from our corrupt leaders. Vote Trump, so that we can save America and he can pardon Julian Assange. Yes America, after all of this, how can you vote for Hillary or stay at home on election day?! How could you?!

We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.§ The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton. ※People are going to prison,§ he said. Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said. ※If they don＊t cooperate they are going to see long sentences,§ a federal law enforcement source said. NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high-ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said. Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner＊s cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge. The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein＊s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries. Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein＊s guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.

    "text": "Email Print Pre-election ※results§ conditioning public to accept rigged Hillary ※victory§ A NBC station was caught posting election results showing a Hillary Clinton victory days before the election, fueling concerns that the mainstream media is conditioning the public to accept a rigged election favoring Hillary. Political activists discovered a hidden web site for WRCB out of Chattanooga, Tenn. showing election results with Hillary Clinton securing 343 electoral votes and 42% of the popular vote. The web site originated from the FTP server of WorldNow, a media software company that provides real-time data 每 such as election results 每 and other media assets to local news stations. The activist who found the page pointed out that the results align well with the ※fractional vote§ method used by voting machines to rig elections to a predetermined outcome. ※On election day, you will see the same percentages overall, with only the numbers that claim to equal them different,§ the activist reported. ※The difference in total votes shown on the station pages, with the same overall final percentages proves the election theft is automated to hit desired percentages, no one has to lift a finger during the election itself to accomplish the steal.§ Election fraud expert Bev Harris was the first to uncover this method, which is also known as ※vote shaving.§ ※You need to have votes counted as fractions,§ Harris said on The Alex Jones Show Monday. ※You need the votes to be counted with decimal places, like you count money.§ ※If a vote is a dollar, you also need to have cents with it. That will not show. It＊s hidden.§ Vote shaving works by treating votes as decimals rather than whole numbers, which allows the machines to allocate the remaining fractional percentages elsewhere to sway election outcomes. ※There＊s this one central computer, which at the end of the day, all the votes come to it,§ Harris pointed out. ※That＊s where you take it. You don＊t run around to 5,000 different precincts. You wait until the votes come to you, and then you have your way with them.§ And, interestingly, it appears the majority of the local news stations get their election results from the same software company. Skeptics suggested the WorldNow page was part of a code test to ensure the software would post the actual results, but surprisingly, the data on the page was typed in 每 with no apparent code tabulating anything. And it＊s revealing that, more often than not, when the mainstream media ※tests§ election result software, it shows the establishment candidate winning the election. At the very least, the results page shows obvious media bias towards Hillary, and it follows a pattern by the mainstream media to claim Hillary has already won the election weeks before Nov. 8 in an attempt to suppress voter enthusiasm for Trump, which is one of his major advantages. This discovery comes amid Project Veritas＊ damning videos exposing Democrat operatives discussing how they＊ve been rigging elections for the last 50 years, as well as Wikileaks＊ relentless data dumping of John Podesta＊s emails revealing more collusion and corruption between the Clinton campaign and the mainstream media.

    "text": "Email Print It seems like everyone associated with the Clintons has become immune to common sense. The Obama Justice Department will not do anything to hold this woman accountable, even though far better people than her have had their careers ended over similar crimes. However, the NYPD isn＊t under Clinton or Obama＊s control. Erik Prince, Blackwater Founder and Former Navy Seal, told Breitbart what the NYPD＊s approach might be. According to some of his well-placed sources in the NYPD, Prince told Breitbart the following: ※The NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making [in the Anthony Weiner investigation] but they received ＆huge push back＊ from the Justice Department.§ as per Breitbart . Why is the NYPD involved in the Clinton case? Well, they weren＊t originally, but they made the initial discovery of the new Clinton emails on Anthony Weiner＊s laptop. Judging from the amount of information they found on the laptop, it seems the FBI and the State Department had insiders protecting Clinton. Allegedly, the criminal activity found on that laptop is enough to make Al Capone blush. ※They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,§ Prince said. Prince even gave some insight as to why FBI Director Comey decided to re-open the investigation. In a nutshell, the NYPD forced his hand. ※The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI,§ Prince said. ※They said, ＆We＊re going to go public with this if you don＊t reopen the investigation and you don＊t do the right thing with timely indictments,＊§ Prince explained. ※NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,§ Prince elaborated. ※Weiner and Huma Abedin, his wife 每 the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years 每 have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have 每 they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton＊s own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.§ Allegedly, some of the crimes the emails reveal include money laundering, lying, and even sex trafficking young children. The NYPD doesn＊t mess around, so they have appointed a new, unbiased, prosecutor in order to investigate these claims by Erik Prince. If only Lynch＊s Justice Department knew how to make unbiased appointments. The warning for the voters is simple: if Hillary Clinton is elected, there will a constitutional crisis on our hands. She may very well be the first President to be indicted before her first day in the Oval Office. If these criminal accusations are true, they will lead to such staggering events. It would make Watergate seem like a walk in the park. But, its not too late to do the right thing and avoid all of this. Vote Trump and Hillary will be where she belongs 〞 in prison.

    "text": "VIA Conservative Daily Post In an email sent to Cheryl Mills from John Podesta the evening of March 2, 2015, hours after the New York Times reported that Clinton possibly violated federal record requirements by using the private server, a shocking revelation has been uncovered. According to the latest batch of Podesta＊s hacked emails, Podesta writes, ※Not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later.§ Mills responded, ※Think you just got your new nick name.§ The ※Lanny§ reference is to lawyer Lanny Davis, who served as special counsel to former President, Bill Clinton. Lawyers, unfortunately, are not always the most honest individuals and have been known to cover up for their guilty clients. Hillary Clinton is one of these lawyers. Cheryl Mills is the same woman who oversaw the controversial construction of a South Korean sweat shop being built in Haiti. A week after this email exchange took place, Hillary Clinton announced that she would love nothing more than to share her emails with the general public, claiming she had nothing to hide. At least, she didn＊t think she did. After being subpoenaed by federal court, Hillary Clinton acid-washed her private server, deleting thousands of emails. She denied, under oath, that classified information was ever on the server or sent/discussed via her private email address. Acid-washing a server costs a pretty penny. If she truly had nothing to hide, why did she completely bleach her server free of everything? Thanks to leaked emails from WikiLeaks, it has been proven that Hillary lied when she said no classified information had ever been involved with her private server- Not only was there classified information stored and talked about, but hackers were able to intercept the data and correspondence. New York Post comments, ※Democrats on the House Oversight Committee point to Clinton tweeting on March 4, 2015, calling on the State Department to release her 55,000 pages of work files.§ ※I want the public to see my email,§ Hillary wrote two days after the Podesta message. At the time, the real Lanny Davis was in support of Clinton addressing her emails. Another WikiLeaks email displays members of the Clinton Organization getting frustrated with Davis＊ public voicing. ※We gotta zap Lanny out of our universe,§ campaign manager Robby Mook wrote Podesta March 8, 2015. ※Can＊t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.§ Good thing for Lanny Davis, ※zap§ doesn＊t equate to ※wet-work.§ Although Davis may have been rash to announce and support Hillary Clinton＊s innocence, the DNC had major issues with it. Davis told Fox News host Chris Wallace, during a televised interview, about Hillary Clinton＊s private email server- ※there can be a neutral party to review all these records 每 nothing unlawful.§ Apparently, Davis wasn＊t given the memo by Hillary Clinton＊s team regarding her bleached server and it＊s true contents. ※I think it is a reasonable idea if anybody has any doubts that there＊s a delete on a hard drive- to have an independent go inspect her private e-mail?§ Davis added. Hillary Clinton is known for lying, her own chairman doesn＊t even believe her when she claims she ※forgets§ things. \nEVEN PODESTA KNOWS SHE IS A LIAR! Hillary Clinton wouldn＊t know honesty if it slapped her in the face. She is a psychopathic liar that thirsts for ways to obscenely scam on a global spectrum. She calls out Donald Trump for ※using the system§ but in no way has he abused the system in the grand scale that the Clintons have. He＊s a business man, he was simply following the laws that government had implemented. Floods of emails and documents are being leaked every day by Anonymous, WikiLeaks and the FBI. These are desperate cries for help mostly from whistle blowers who have been intimately involved with the government, trying to warn American citizens of certain madness and despair that awaits us if Hillary Clinton wins presidency. Donald J. Trump genuinely cares for the American people. He is a natural leader, he enjoys helping people because he believes in bettering America, not policies that encourage ＆pay for play＊. Hillary Clintons transparency is starting to become blurred. Shatter the busted deception and lock everyone involved with the Clinton scandals in prison. Donald Trump recognizes the need for America to rebuild, which starts with depleting government corruption and replacing government officials. This is something Hillary could never accomplish. Hillary Clinton would just hire her friends and abuse her position of power, as she＊s done for nearly four decades. John Podesta suggested that Hillary Clinton delete her emails- he must believe she is capable of worse than sharing classified information and as president of the United States, who would stop her from committing even more crime? She would put each and every one of our lives on the line and not think twice. Do you think Hillary Clinton ever gets tired of lying, each lie covering up the next? And even Podesta don＊t believe her! Why should America? \nIf you haven＊t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so. Leave a comment...",

    "text": "( New York Times Results by County) The media won＊t tell you this but Donald Trump CRUSHED Hillary Clinton in the recent election in three key areas: For one, the above results by county show that he picked up a significant amount of the counties in the US. The picture is clear that most counties in America voted for Trump . Secondly, the media is also hiding from you that Trump CRUSHED Hillary in the Electoral College (EC). As of today, most if not all media outlets show that Trump won the election with only 279 EC votes. But the truth is Trump also won Michigan with 16 EC votes and Arizona with 11 EC votes for a total of 306 EC votes. Hillary only won 228 EC votes but it looks like she barely won New Hampshire which should put her at 232 EC votes. As a result, Trump won 57% of all EC votes. HIllary turned in the Democratic Party＊s worst Electoral College performance in 28 years. With only New Hampshire left to be called, Clinton has turned in the Democratic Party's worst Electoral College performance in 28 years pic.twitter.com/APU85Ty50q \n〞 Dan O'Donnell (@DanODradio) November 9, 2016 Thirdly, in total states it was a landslide. Trump won 31 states to 19 states won by Hillary or 62% of the states. The mainstream will argue that Hillary beat Trump in the popular vote which appears accurate. According to the NYT she won 59,923,027 to Trump＊s 59,692,974 for a difference of only 230,053 or 0.4%. But in California and New York Hillary beat Trump by a combined 4 million votes. If not for these two huge liberal states, Hillary would have gotten shellacked in the popular voting as well. The mainstream media will not tell you but Trump won BIGLY! \nIf you haven＊t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so. Leave a comment...",

    "text": "I have been reporting for weeks now about the D.C.-based ※pizza pedophilia§ ring that is being exposed based on thousands of ※Podesta emails§ released by Wikileaks in the past month or two. \nAs of last week, the case became even more explosive. \n〞 Thomas Bernpaine (@ThomasBernpaine) November 11, 2016 \nNow, don＊t get nervous because it looks like computer mumbo-jumbo. You only need to remember two things. \n1 每 Every picture file is actually a code/pattern of numbers that our computers ※translate§ into images on the screen. \n2 每 Some ※extra§ information has been discovered in at least one picture code/pattern from a Wikileaks email. \nI reported weeks ago about this ※pedo ring§ something called ※photo steganography,§ which is just the fancy term for the two points I explained just now. \nThe image (.jpg) of the two girls eating pizza was discovered as an attachment in the Podesta emails by Wikileaks. Data can be hidden in a .jpg file. In that image, a zipped directory (PK) was hidden inside. That doesn＊t happen by accident. The directory likely contains illegal imagery and/or discussion. It is highly suggestive of illegal activity connected to child pornography, child exploitation, and child abuse. \nSome have objected that the pizza.jpg file size is simply too small to contain any useful data (like an image, a link, a message, etc.), but the point is this: all the file would have to ※smuggle§ is a short password to open a secret website or .zip file. The hidden data could literally just be a few bits of information but it could open up thousands of gigabytes of data in the right website or compressed file. That＊s how the users would access the dirty pictures, videos, messages, etc. \nSo, from a technical angle, this method is very possible, and it makes sense of why the Podesta emails include so many strange photo attachments. Are all those attachments little ※Trojan ponies§ for sharing images, videos, passwords, payment resources, etc.? \nWATCH (Language/NSFW Warning): \n※Why do we even have an FBI? Is the FBI just covering for these people?§ \nLet me be honest: \nI have researched corruption cases like this for many years, whether in current events or from historical records. So, I believe I have a somewhat thick skin when it comes to facing human sinfulness and evil like this. \nLast Friday night, however, I won＊t lie: I totally lost it. \nAll of a sudden, too many lightbulbs went off at once, too many connections hit me at once, too many implications dawned on me at once每and I just went into a kind of panic attack about how massive this whole cartel is, how well protected it is, and how truly destructive it is in real children＊s lives. \nIf you want to get an idea of what set me off, let me show you three images. \nBUT I WARN YOU: When you understand the context, these images are EXTREMELY DISTURBING. \nFirst, here is a photo of Tony Podesta＊s favorite work of art in his home: \nTony Podesta is a big fan of ※The Arch of Hysteria§ \nNext, here is an ad from Ping Pong Pizza, a restaurant in D.C. that has numerous, very disturbing connections to pedophilia and D.C. elites like the Podestas. \nAnother ※arch of hysteria§? \nNext we come to a police photo from the Jeffrey Dahmer case. \nVIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED: \nI wonder if Tony Podesta would also like this ※arch of hysteria§＃ \nFinally, here is the logo for Comet Pizza, another D.C. restaurant with deep connections to Ping Pong Pizza and the Podestas. \nCan you see now why I ※lost my [bleep]§ last Friday? \nWorse, in terms of how protected this satanic ring of perverts is, I recently reported that even the DOJ is compromised . \nA man named Arun Rao has shown a disturbing interest in some sexually ※creepy§ images and expressions that are connected to the Podestas and this pedo ring. The problem is that Rao is an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the DOJ. \nSpecifically, Rao is Supervisor of the Southern (※Greenbelt§) Division office for the DOJ＊s District of Maryland in Chevy Chase, Maryland. This means that Rao＊s district is virtually on top of the area in D.C. where Besta Pizza operates. In addition, Besta Pizza and two other associated properties are directly over abandoned underground tunnels, many of which could easily connect to Chevy Chase. \nOn top of his social and geographical proximity to Alefantis, Rao＊s DOJ division handles cases that seem tailor-made for busting〞or covering up〞the dark circles that sex traffickers hide in: federal racketeering, conspiracy, national and international fraud and corruption, immigration violations, counterfeiting, and 〞wait for it〞child pornography . \nIn closing I will leave you with three ※infographics.§ \nThey are very complicated and ※dense§ so I don＊t expect everyone to examine them. \nHowever, even if you don＊t look into the details yourself, I want you to be aware of how vast this whole network of evil is, and, therefore, of how many hands and prayers we need on deck to expose it and bring it down. \n(NOTE: You don＊t have to download these images to view them. You can just right-click open them in a separate internet browser tab, and click ※+§ to zoom in.) \n〞 Thomas Bernpaine (@ThomasBernpaine) November 11, 2016 \nFirst, a diagram of ※key players§ in the pizza restaurant side of the pedo ring. You can see the diagram for yourself here . \nSecond, a much larger diagram of how this pizza-pedo ring connects to international kidnapping (esp. the Madeleine McCann case) and other DNC allies like ※spirit cooker§ Marina Abramovic. \nThis is an ongoing investigation so stay tuned for more. \nShare this article to inform and encourage your friends and family! \nIf you haven＊t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so.

    "text": "Email Print Hillary Clinton had many vocal celebrities on her side during the 2016 presidential election. However, the election proved that most Americans just don＊t care what celebrities have to say about politics. In a recent interview, comedian Bill Burr blasted arrogant celebrities, saying, ※Your ego is so f***ing big you think someone is going, ＆well, I want to vote for Trump, but if he gets elected, we lose Cher!＊§ I could not agree more with what Burr said. These people are celebrities and have no knowledge of foreign relations, economics, or anything other than entertainment for that matter. The liberal celebrities feel their ability to read a script translates to the right to pontificate on the most important issues facing our country. Liberals have had Hollywood in their pocket for years. Other celebrities, such as Katy Perry, Robert De Niro, and Salma Hayek, all came out to support Hillary during the election. Why on earth do these people think anyone will change their vote just because an entertainer threatens to leave the country if his or her candidate doesn＊t win? Even if we did care, we all know they won＊t really move their entire lives to live in another country. Case in point: have any of these anti-Trump celebrities left yet? I didn＊t think so. But we should hold them to their vow! Every Hollywood liberal who threatened to leave the United States if Trump was elected should start packing their bags. Send us a postcard when you are freezing your bums off in Canada! Celebrities only demonstrate one thing when they threaten to leave the US over election results: their disgusting arrogance. Do they honestly think they have a better idea about the economic conditions of the middle class than those actually living in the middle class? No. They just think they＊re entitled to the support of their fans. If they could come down to reality for two seconds and look at the election results, clearly regular Americans don＊t agree. To be frank, we care more about the future of our country than we do about any of these celebrities. Don＊t worry〞we＊ll remember your hypocrisy and self-absorption when you threaten to leave if Trump is re-elected in 2020. What do you think of Bill Burr＊s comments on Hollywood liberals?

    "text": "Archives Michael＊s Latest Video Let＊s Be Clear 每 A Vote For Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For World War 3 By   26th, 2016 \nIf you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as ※dangerous§ and ※temperamental§, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. \nSomeone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are ※going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton§＃ \nOn Syria＊s civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. \nClinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ※safe zones§ on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. \n※What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,§ said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. ※You＊re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.§ \nIn order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. \nAnd in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. \nAccording to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences＃ \nRussia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. \n※I wouldn＊t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,§ Clapper said, speaking with CBS＊ Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. \nOf course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria ※would require us to go to war§ ＃ \n※Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,＃ That＊s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I＊m not going to make.§ ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) \nBut Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. \nYou see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn＊t for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no ※humanitarian crisis§ in Syria at all. \nThanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won＊t have anywhere to hide. \nSo the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. \nOne recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates ＃ \n※Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation 每 at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,§ Putin said. \n※Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,§ Putin noted. \nAnyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. \nAnd even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania ＃ Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America＊s troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. \nIn addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia＃ \nAfter accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. \nA rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. \n※The US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,§ said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen S?reide. \nMost Americans aren＊t aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. \nBut in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation ＃ \nRussian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. \nAt the Kremlin＊s Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. \nThe country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. \nI know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. \nIn my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn＊t know how the election would turn out. \nAt this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. \nIf you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don＊t do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. \nIf the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years. \nAbout the author: Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream.

    "text": "Archives Michael＊s Latest Video Will Michelle Obama Be The Replacement Nominee If The FBI Email Investigation Ends Hillary Clinton＊s Campaign?   30th, 2016 \nI realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre, but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen. We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. \nIn fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled ※ Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside ※＃ \nSo what should the Democrats do now? \nIf ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: \nThey would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. \nDemocrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. \nBut what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year＊s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group＊s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nSo if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. \nWho would they choose? \nLet＊s take a look at the top five options＃ \n#1 Tim Kaine \nHe would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton＊s running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. \nAnd at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. \nSo to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. \n#2 Joe Biden \nVice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run ＃ \nVice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. \nBiden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton＊s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. \nBut according to the vice president, the short answer is ※no.§ The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. \nUnfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. \nBiden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn＊t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. \nBiden would probably represent the ※safest§ choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. \n#3 Bernie Sanders \nBernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. \nFirst of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. \nSecondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. \nThirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be ※another McGovern§ and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. \nSo even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. \n#4 Elizabeth Warren \nElizabeth Warren would be very popular with the ※Bernie Sanders§ wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. \nSo she is definitely a possibility. \nBut she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as ※another McGovern§ because of her far left policies. \n#5 Michelle Obama \nOne recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. \nAnd these days Barack Obama＊s approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. \nSo the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. \nMichelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as ※the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign§ in a recent MSN article entitled ※ In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice ※＃ \nThe speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama＊s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. \n※When you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,§ said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. ※We know she didn＊t like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.§ \nIf I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. \nOf course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. \nAnd I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. \nIn the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. \nAnd if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down.",

    "text": "Archives Michael＊s Latest Video Did America Really Pass The Test? 每 Hillary Clinton Is Going To Win The Popular Vote By A Wide Margin By Michael Snyder, on November 9th, 2016 \nThe 2016 election was a test, and it would be easy to assume that since Donald Trump won the election that America passed the test. Unfortunately, it may not be that simple. A closer look at the numbers reveals a very sobering reality. Yes, Donald Trump won far more electoral votes than Hillary Clinton did, and that means that he is on track to become our next president . But Hillary Clinton is going to win the popular vote, and it is likely to be by a very wide margin once all the votes are counted. \nAs I write this article, Hillary Clinton has a lead of 218,000 in the popular vote, but most of the votes that have not been counted are on the west coast. \nIn California, Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by a 5,482,166 to 2,966,654 margin, and only 68 percent of the vote has been counted so far. So assuming that the ratio stays about the same the rest of the way, Clinton is going to add at least a million more votes to her lead just from the state of California. \nUp in Washington state, Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by more than 370,000 votes, and only 60 percent of the vote has been counted there so far. So she could easily pick up another 200,000 votes in that state. \nWhen everything is all said and done, it seems very likely that Hillary Clinton will have received well over a million more votes than Donald Trump did in this election. \nSo the truth is that the American people chose Hillary Clinton, but because of some electoral college magic Donald Trump is the winner of the election. \nAnd I am certainly very, very happy that Hillary Clinton is not going to be our next president. Four years under her ※leadership§ would have likely been the final nail in the coffin for our nation. My hope is that she will now disappear from national politics for good. \nBut just because she is not going to be our next president does not mean that we passed the test. \nIn this election, the American people were faced with a very stark choice. Hillary Clinton is the most wicked politician that our country has ever seen, and over the past three decades the American people have gotten to know exactly who she is and what she stands for. \nAnd despite knowing exactly what they would be getting, more Americans voted for her than voted for Donald Trump. \nIf every vote counted equally, she would be our next president. \nI certainly don＊t mean to rain on the Trump parade. Christians, conservatives and patriots are right to celebrate this victory by Donald Trump. But the truth is that I don＊t believe that we did actually pass the test that we were faced with. \nAs a nation, we willingly chose Hillary Clinton by a pretty substantial margin. \nAnd don＊t think that the radical left is going to forget that Trump lost the popular vote. Already, violence and protests have erupted all over the nation. \nShortly after Trump declared victory, riots broke out in Berkeley, San Jose and Oakland ＃ \n※Not my president! Not my president!§ chanted anti-Trump rioters in Berkley, California as they light flares and storm the streets. \nRiots erupted in Berkley, San Jose and Oakland shortly after the announcement of Donald Trump as president-elect. Rioters are breaking into stores, vandalizing cars and shooting flares. \nOne woman in Oakland was hit by a car on Highway 24 just after midnight and has suffered serious injuries after. When she pulled over to the right shoulder, she was surrounded by anti-Trump rioters, who vandalized her car and broke the back window, according to CHP officers. \nThere were reports of protesters burning American flags in some areas of the country, and there were even brawls outside of the White House . \nAnd once the sun set on Wednesday night, the protests started again. According to USA Today , ※thousands of demonstrators§ have hit the streets in New York City＃ \nIn New York, thousands of demonstrators blocked off streets around Trump Tower near the busy intersection of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, chanting ※hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go§ and ※p〞y grabs back,§ a reference to tape of a Trump conversation from years back in which he One woman protester was topless while another climbed on top of a tree to see the activity. Taxis, city buses and passenger vehicles stood at a standstill. \nIn Boston, radical leftists were organizing a giant protest against Trump ＃ \nFar-left organizers are planning a mass protest in Boston against President-elect Donald Trump, citing the need to ※immediately start fighting against him.§ \nApproximately 2,300 people have indicated they will gather outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston tonight for a ※Boston Against Trump Rally.§ According to the Facebook event page, another 5,000 people say they may be interested in attending. \n※Donald Trump is the next President of the United States. We need to immediately start fighting against him. We need to build a movement to fight racism, sexism, and Islamophobia,§ the event description says. \nSadly, this could be the beginning of a new era of protests, rioting and civil unrest. \nInstead of coming together behind the new president, the radical left seems ready to go to war. \nSo even though Trump won the election, the truth is that our troubles may only just be starting. More than half the country didn＊t want Trump, our nation was already more divided than it has been in decades before he won, and it won＊t take much for many of our big cities to descend into utter chaos. \nWithout a doubt, we should be very excited that Donald Trump won the election, but an election victory is not going to magically make our problems go away. \nWhen faced with the most monumental election in any of our lifetimes, Hillary Clinton received the most votes from the American people, and the consequences for that decision may be far more severe than most people are now anticipating. \nAbout the author: Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream.

    "text": "The List Of Establishment Republicans That Say They Are Voting For Hillary Clinton Is Staggering By Michael Snyder, on August 1st, 2016 \nWho would have ever believed that so many big names in the Republican Party would publicly pledge to vote for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election? All throughout the primaries and the caucuses, the Republican establishment expressed tremendous disdain for Donald Trump, but they were unable to derail his march to the nomination. Now that we have reached the general election, some of the biggest names in the GOP are actually taking the unprecedented step of crossing over to the other side and are publicly announcing their support for Hillary Clinton. This shows that many of these individuals were only ※Republicans in name only§ to begin with, and it also demonstrates the lengths that the elite are willing to go to in order to keep Donald Trump out of the White House. \nOne of the latest big Republican names to publicly support Hillary Clinton is Sally Bradshaw. CNN is describing her as ※Jeb Bush＊s top adviser§, and she has gone so far as to completely remove herself from the Republican Party because of Donald Trump＃ \nJeb Bush＊s top adviser, Sally Bradshaw, has left the Republican Party to become an independent, and says if the presidential race in Florida is close, she＊ll vote for Hillary Clinton. \nBradshaw, who＊s been close to the former Florida governor for decades and was senior adviser to his 2016 campaign, officially switched her registration to unaffiliated. She told CNN＊s Jamie Gangel in an email interview that the GOP is ※at a crossroads and have nominated a total narcissist 〞 a misogynist 〞 a bigot.§ \n※This is a time when country has to take priority over political parties. Donald Trump cannot be elected president,§ Bradshaw said. \nBradshaw has been working for the Bushes ever since the 1988 presidential campaign, and she never would have made such a bold move without the approval of the Bushes. \nNeedless to say, the Bushes absolutely hate Trump, and they have a vested interest in seeing him lose the election. There are some that believe that Jeb Bush is already lining up for another run in 2020, and Donald Trump has to lose in order for that to be possible. \nIn addition to Sally Bradshaw, another prominent friend of the Bush family has also recently announced that he is going to be voting for Hillary Clinton. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was at the center of the storm during the financial crisis of 2008, and not too long ago he announced his intentions in the Washington Post ＃ \n※ When it comes to the presidency, I will not vote for Donald Trump ,§ Paulson wrote in The Washington Post last week . ※I will not cast a write-in vote. I＊ll be voting for Hillary Clinton , with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world. To my Republican friends: I know I＊m not alone.§ \nDoes Henry Paulson actually believe that Hillary Clinton can ※bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world§? \nI find that difficult to believe. \nBut apparently he intends to try to persuade as many of his fellow Republicans as possible to vote for Hillary Clinton, and a whole bunch of other establishment Republicans have already lined up behind her. \nThese are just some of the big Republican names that the Washington Post says have already committed to voting for Hillary Clinton＃ \nRichard Armitage , deputy secretary of state and adviser to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush \nBrent Scowcroft , chairman of the President＊s Intelligence Advisory Board and adviser to three previous GOP presidents \nAlan Steinberg , regional EPA administrator \nKori Schake , National Security Council and State Department aide \nDoug Elmets , former Reagan spokesman \nJim Cicconi , former Reagan and George H.W. Bush aide \nCharles Fried , former U.S. solicitor general under Reagan \nRobert Kagan , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, former Reagan State Department aide and adviser to the presidential campaigns of John McCain and Mitt Romney \nMax Boot , senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and adviser to GOP presidential candidates \nPeter Mansoor , retired Army colonel and former aide to David Petraeus \nLarry Pressler , former three-term Republican senator from South Dakota \nArne Carlson , a former two-term Republican governor of Minnesota \nRobert Smith , former judge on New York＊s highest court, the Court of Appeals \nMark Salter , former top adviser to John McCain \nMike Treiser , former Mitt Romney aide \nBen Howe , editor at RedState.com \nAs I have said all along, the establishment will do whatever it has to do to keep Donald Trump out of the White House. \nIf that means voting for Hillary Clinton and encouraging others to do the same, that is precisely what they are going to do. \nAnd if more insidious means are necessary, the establishment definitely has plenty of tricks up their sleeves. Politics in America is a very, very dirty game, and if you have ever been deep inside a national campaign you know exactly what I am talking about. \nAt this point, even Donald Trump is raising concerns about the integrity of the upcoming election. On Monday, he told a rally in Ohio that he is ※afraid the election is going to be rigged§ ＃ \nDonald Trump said he＊s afraid the general election in November will be rigged, but didn＊t elaborate on the comment at a rally in Ohio Monday afternoon. \n※ I＊m afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest ,§ the Republican nominee for president said, in remarks that did not mention the controversy generated by his comments about the parents of a slain U.S. soldier. \nIn my opinion, Donald Trump has legitimate reasons to be concerned. We have already seen the elite spend millions upon millions of dollars to try to defeat him, and virtually all of the big money on Wall Street is lining up behind his opponent. Many patriotic, conservative and faith-oriented Americans are really hoping that Trump can win and move this nation in a positive direction, but the truth is that he is facing overwhelming odds. \nUltimately, it is probably not going to matter too much who wins this election, because America is on the verge of a time of chaos unlike anything we have ever seen before. No matter who the next president is, we are going to see civil unrest, rising crime, political scandals, governmental shaking, major economic and financial problems, and geopolitical events will continue to spiral out of control. \nAnd the establishment is going to do everything it possibly can to make sure that the next president is not Donald Trump. If you go to just about any major news website on the Internet these days, there will be a negative story about Donald Trump featured very prominently, and it is usually accompanied by some sort of positive story about Hillary Clinton. \nIn the end, one of the biggest stories that will come out of the 2016 election will be the fact that the American people got to see how far the elite are willing to go to keep someone that is not ※in the club§ from becoming president. \nThe establishment absolutely loathes Trump, and they are willing to move heaven and earth to try to stop him. \nHold on tight, because the next three months are going to be very, very interesting. \nIt is nice to see people are standing behind the candidate that won. Not! \nI am not surprised. Liars, Liars, Pants on fire. \nEveryone of them probably pledged to support the candidate that got the nomination. Now they are going against him because he is so crude? You renege on your word and you are nothing. Because your word is like a contract. No one wants to deal with liars. Hilliary also has a reputation and it isn＊t good about lying. I suggest that is what will make or break the candidate going for election. Whether or not they are publicly lying or not. Tatiana Covington \nThey＊re scared to death! greanfinisher . \nI really don＊t blame them as he gives me the creeps too. P>Hopkins \nWhy? greanfinisher . \nThe man is unstable, unpredictable and impresses me as being an immature delinquent inside a man＊s body. Imagine imploring the Russians to divulge whatever information that they gathered concerning the Clinton e-mails. Even before that, there was the episode in which his campaign manager man- handled a female reporter, and left gouge marks in her arm. Even during his rants and raves, he succeeded in not only alienating the women, but the minorities as well. It＊s no small wonder then why the GOP is simply tossing the man overboard, and throwing their weight behind the ol＊ bag.

Clinton is no prize by any stretch of the imagination, but she＊s light years ahead of Donald when it comes to honesty＃ and YES, I realize that she＊s seen as the ultimate liar. But Donald has consistently lied so, so very much more. And he＊s made a name in politics solely by taunting and bullying. \nI tried so hard to stay with him, to vote party line rather than personality, but the whole juvenile ※Little Marco§ garbage was just unacceptable, and he＊s only become more and more childish and bratty since then. You don＊t reward bratty, childish, talentless hacks by voting for them, even IF they claim to be the party you＊ve supported your whole life. P>Hopkins \nParty is irrelevant. You are seriously comfortable with Hillary putting up to 5 people on the SCOTUS? And if you honestly believe that Hillary is more honest than Trump, then you need an intervention to stop your addiction to the crack sold by the media and the left. Because you are obviously smoking it. All of that being said, you are one of those people that will believe what you want to believe regardless of any facts that could be presented. Its a shame that Americans have become so brain dead. GV \nhow many people has Trump murdered? \nhow many people has Hillary the war criminal murdered? Janet Hall \nWell, your reply to Mr groanfisher was far more polite than mine. We＊ll stick with yours. Well said. loadnup \nYou won＊t accept this but the gop is tossing him because he will disrupt their gravy train and the truth is his ※rants and raves§ are pointing out what the hitlery has done, is capable of and will do if elected. I love the article I read where President Trump said she even lies when she lies＃ pray, prep and protect. greanfinisher . \nThey＊re tossing him primarily because the man simply will not work with anyone, and certainly not with Congress. iris \nThere are so few in Congress who have enough spine to merit being worked with at all. Maybe he would shake them away from their country clubs for an afternoon or two. iris \nWhat＊s outrageously funny, is that the crud the establishment GOP has been pulling for decades, while systematically selling out their constituency and what Republicans are supposed to stand for, is, that＊s what drove folks to Trump in the first place, and now, they think people are that gullible to buy more of the same, with their MSM smear tactics. Every time they pay (heck, maybe they don＊t pay a dime) for some tabloid-looking ad against Trump, it confirms what has been going on for far too long, and strengthens the resolve of his supporters. Guest＊s the Name \nThe veterans are also abandoning him. \nHe blatantly lied about donating huge sums of $$ to them, he has repeatedly insulted the service of many veterans (including John McCain, who is too kind and good to even denounce that awful Trump). \nThere is only one demographic in favor of Donald, the angry, uneducated white man. greanfinisher . \nThose in the oligarchy typically donate nothing destined for the public good. Rather, virtually all of them have set up the so-called ＆foundations＊ which are used primarily for money laundering and tax avoidance purposes. The Clinton Foundation is a prime example of such. Yes, all of these foundations are required by law to donate a certain percentage to charity, but it＊s paltry compared to the disproportionate monetary gains involved. Even worse, the donations are mostly directed towards .operas, art museums, symphonies, and theaters 每 where they spend their leisure time fraternizing with other wealthy benefactors. In addition, some donations are routed towards elite prep schools and Ivy League universities (such as Yale, Princeton, Harvard) which do not have a reputation for educating poor young people. Whatever amount of sugar coating that may be applied, those are obviously not charities as most people understand the term. iris \nI disagree. He wouldn＊t be my first choice, but I＊m fairly educated and know plenty of other educated people, who don＊t want another blatantly liberal politician in the office. At least there＊s a possibility that Trump won＊t further what＊s been destroying our country for decades, literally. 58 million innocent citizens, is one good example. iris \nWell, they have a much better chance at fair treatment from him than her. Dems are most often the party which gets us into war, and the party which strengthens, respects and provides for the military, has been the Republicans. Tobby99 \nYou are right. Bush was a Democrat. Muhahahahahahahaha. P>Hopkins \nMcCain is an establishment RINO. THAT＊S why he is opposed to Trump. The veterans and active duty people are not abandoning him at all. Don＊t use McCain as the standard-bearer for veterans. And I find it real funny when people like you parrot what the left wing media and eRINOs say about Trump supporters. I have news for you＃education doesn＊t mean a damn thing when its indoctrination GV \ninsane McCain GV \n※＃Imagine imploring the Russians to divulge whatever information that they presumably gathered from the Clinton e-mails＃.§ \nyou mean the 30,000 emails Hillary deleted because they were evidence of her crimes? \ndon＊t worry, LOTS of countries have copies of the emails of the unindicted criminal UncleMike Davis \nAnd Donald J Trump has driven them all out of their dens, their lairs, caves, holes, from under rocks, and exposed the corrupt establishment to all Americans, all the world; those with eyes wide open. It seems their end is near, as both corrupt establishment parties self-destruct, dragging down the New World Order, Babylon the Great of Revelation 18, the Rothschilds with all their demons, into their well deserved end. \nThank you Donald J Trump. May Almighty GOD, the Lord JESUS Christ, bless you and your family, and bless your intentions to Make America Great Again. greanfinisher . \nI figured some time ago that the Republican hierarchy was going to desert Trump while supporting Clinton. Heck, some prominent Republican figures are even actively campaigning for the gun confiscatin＊ witch. I＊ll have to readily admit that Trump scares me too as he seems to be a loose cannon. loadnup \nNot to even mention her promise to significantly increase taxes＃ yep, it＊s gonna be an interesting time we worthless eaters are heading into＃ pray, prep and protect. winrob \nOriental ※blessing§ (?): May you live in interesting times. greanfinisher . \nDon＊t you think I know that? With the reign of terror that the gun confiscatin＊ witch is almost certainly going to brew up, it＊ll even make the Obama tyranny look good. stop Hitlery \nHere＊s how the gun confiscation will probably go: People keep expecting the gun confiscation to be an above board program where police go door to door removing guns from homes. They think martial law will be announced on the evening news with troops rolling into town and setting up on street corners. Those days are long gone and they just don＊t work that way anymore. When it happens (as in NOW) it will be low profile, subtle and in stages to avoid the backlash (which everyone is waiting to see overt evidence before they fight back). Martial law won＊t be declared but will be activated, most likely under an innocent sounding name. Evacuating people to ※shelters§ will be the ruse to imprisoning the masses. Gun confiscation will be silent and also under the guise of something else but the unstated purpose will be gun confiscation.

Mass vaccinations would be a good one or an outbreak where large numbers of people will have to be quarantined. They definitely will not be doing things like this in a way that would trigger a mass response so you can forget waiting for them to signal the roundup is about to begin. greanfinisher . \nObviously the gun confiscatin＊ cronies are beginning the ruse now.

I always thought this notion was FDR propaganda, until now. Only the Rich are upset at Donald who will deport their cheap labor and tax their cheap products made with third world slaves. \nDon＊t worry though. In order for The Donald to win it will take a public not susceptible to the avalanche of Donald Hate sure to come his way. Fat chance of that. The Public are by and large gullible, illiterate morons. One point that proves this. All of the polls point to Hillary with a slight lead. How can this be? The Donald has a much higher percentage of Republican vote than Hillary has of Democrat votes (The hard core Bernites won＊t vote for her. Did you see the half empty arena last week and the ads for paid seat fillers to go with the White Noise Machines to drown out the boos?). The Donald leads with Independents nearly 2 to 1. How do these numbers add up? Of course they don＊t and yet the public is too stupid to figure the polling scam out and be outraged. jaxon64 \nAgreed每especially about fear of losing their cheap labor from illegals here and cheap labor for their corporations by off-shoring jobs. The Donald hate is so prevalent it is ridiculous. Just this morning before 8 AM I saw revolving hate ads against Trump when I turned on Roku/Pandora for some morning music每one pop-up ad despicably talking about old, nude photos of Ivana Trump.

    "text": "Is Hillary Clinton The Athaliah Of Our Generation? Just Check Out What One Eyewitness Is Saying＃   June 6th, 2016 \nIt is amazing to me that the American people would willingly choose an exceedingly wicked woman such as Hillary Clinton to lead them. Perhaps this is just more evidence of how incredibly far we have fallen as a nation. There are many out there that are comparing Hillary Clinton to Queen Jezebel from ancient Israel, but to me there is another figure in the Bible that is much more appropriate. Somewhere around 2800 years ago, King Jehoram of Judah was married to a very wicked woman named Athaliah. When Jehoram unexpectedly died, his son Ahaziah became king of Judah for about a year, but then he died too. At that point Athaliah seized power and tried to kill off all male descendants that might pose a threat to her reign. Fortunately, one very young male descendant did survive, and Athaliah was finally deposed after six horrible years. If you take a close look at the careers of Hillary Clinton and Athaliah, there are definitely some striking parallels between the two＃ \n-They were both initially married to the ruler of the nation. \n-They both had very prominent roles while their husbands ruled. \n-They both had an extraordinary lust for power. \n-They both exhibited extreme paranoia and dealt ruthlessly with anyone that was a potential threat to their hold on power. \n-Athaliah greatly promoted the worship of Baal in ancient Judah, and one of the key elements of Baal worship was child sacrifice. Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, more than 58 million babies have been murdered in the United States, and Hillary Clinton has spent her entire career telling women that they have ※a right to choose§ to kill their children. \nIt would take an entire set of encyclopedias to document all of the evil things that we already know that Hillary Clinton has done, but now disturbing new evidence is coming forward. \nFormer Secret Service agent Gary Byrne is a 29 year veteran of the military and federal law enforcement, and his new book entitled ※ Crisis of Character § has been the topic of the top headline on the Drudge Report for two days in a row. According to Byrne, Hillary Clinton was so angry and so violent while the Clintons were living in the White House that Secret Service agents and White House staff constantly ※lived in terror of her next tirade§ ＃ \n※What I saw in the 1990s sickened me,§ he writes in the intro of the book, ※ Crisis of Character: A White House Secret Service Officer Discloses his Firsthand Experience with Hillary, Bill, and How They Operate .§ \nThe book claims she repeatedly screamed obscenities at her husband, Secret Service personnel and White House staffers 〞 all of whom lived in terror of her next tirade . \nIn recent years, the media has been absolutely brutal on celebrities that have committed domestic violence, and rightfully so. \nBut why does Hillary Clinton get away with it? \nAccording to Byrne, one particularly violent encounter with Hillary resulted in Bill Clinton having a ※real, live, put-a-steak-on-it black eye§ ＃ \nA former Secret Service officer who helped protect Hillary Clinton while she was in the White House charges in a new tell-all book that the former first lady had a ＆volcanic＊ temper and occasionally got violent with her husband 每 and that a loud 1995 fight left the president with a black eye . \nIn the book, ＆ Crisis of Character ,＊ former agency officer Gary Bryne, details arriving at work after a 1995 shouting-match that left a light blue vase ＆smashed to bits＊ and Bill sporting a ＆real, live, put-a-steak-on-it black eye.＊ \nThings got so bad that Secret Service agents had discussions about the possibility they might have to protect the president from his wife＊s physical attacks , the New York Post reported in advance excerpts of the book. \nNow let me ask you a question＃ \nWhat should be done to a violent husband that gives his wife a black eye? \nOf course the answer is obvious. \nSo why wouldn＊t we treat Hillary Clinton exactly the same way as a society? \nThere are many other extremely interesting details in Byrne＊s new book, including the fact that he once interrupted Bill Clinton making out with a woman that was not his wife ＃ \nByrne 〞 who was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury that investigated Bill Clinton＊s affair with intern Monica Lewinsky 〞 claims in the book that he interrupted the president＊s sexual shenanigans in the White House. \nByrne says he walked into a room where the president was ※involved inappropriately with a woman§ who was neither his wife nor Lewinsky . \nThese are the people that we want to put back into the White House? \nAre we completely nuts? \nThere are even more shocking details from the book that I cannot share with you because they are so sordid that they are not appropriate for many of the family friendly websites this article will be appearing on. \nIn the end, I am so glad that Byrne has decided to come forward, because the American people deserve to know the truth about Hillary Clinton. As a former Secret Service agent, he says that there is no way that the Clintons should ever be allowed back into the White House ＃ \n※Hillary Clinton is now poised to become the Democratic nominee for president of the United States, but she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office. From the bottom of my soul I know this to be true. So I must speak out. \nI had no animosity toward the Clintons. Out of a sense of loyalty to our First Family I even secretly disposed of sordid physical evidence that might later have been used to convict the president. The blue dress wasn＊t the only evidence of his misdeeds. But I could not keep from asking myself how our nation＊s leaders could be so reckless, so volatile, and so dangerous to themselves and to our nation. And yes, to me and my family. \nI want you to hear my story. It＊s about the men and women risking their lives to protect this nation. And more important, it＊s about how the Clintons must never again be allowed to put them or you and your children〞at risk.§ \nOf course what Byrne is saying meshes very well with what other Secret Service agents have said in the past. Investigative journalist Ron Kessler interviewed many of them for his book entitled ※The First Family Detail§ , and he revealed in that book that many agents consider it to be ※a form of punishment§ when they are assigned to Hillary Clinton＃ However, Hillary is exposed as being the complete opposite of her husband and daughter, and instead is reportedly very rude and acted nasty toward a number of agents. ＆Hillary was very rude to agents, and she didn＊t appear to like law enforcement or the military,＊ former Secret Service agent Lloyd Bulman recalled to Kessler. ＆She wouldn＊t go over and meet military people or police officers, as most protectees do. ＆She was just really rude to almost everybody. She＊d act like she didn＊t want you around, like you were beneath her.＊ \nIf we are not going to believe Secret Service agents, who are we going to believe? \nOver the years, literally dozens of insiders have come forward to tell the truth about the Clintons, and yet the American people continue to embrace them. \nIn the end, we get the leaders that we deserve, and the people that we send to Washington are a reflection of who we are as a nation. \nSo if we send this generation＊s version of Athaliah to the White House in November, what will that say about us? \nPerhaps that is something that we all should be thinking about in the months ahead＃ Was The Gotthard Base Tunnel Opening Ceremony An Illuminati Ritual Intended To Honor Satan? ? William Lutz \nWhen a woman is attacked by a man, she is the pampered victim of domestic violence who gets special treatment. On the other hand, when a man is attacked by a woman, he is the aggressor who initiated the fight. That＊s a perfect example of feminist double standards. Hitlery physically abused her husband and it was swept under the rug. I don＊t know why certain people such as the Clintons are not held accountable for their actions. theShipIsSinking \nTwo questions:※Why are the Clintons (and a long list of others including the Bush Dynasty, Nixon and other ※conservatives§) not held accountable for their actions?§ Answer: The elite and their puppets are not subjects of the rest of the laws that apply to the most of us. This is why the halls of congress and the White House are filled with lawyers with a few exceptions. From their point of view and the way the laws are written they are people and we are dumb animals to be used as slave labor. Thus the Personal Income Tax. \n(Implied) ※Why the double standard against men?§ Answer: It is part of their sexist war on Men, especially ※white,§ heterosexual, conservative men who love the constitution and the Bible. Their religion of Militant Liberalism (supported by both parties) is the apex of Hypocrisy, Hate, Intolerance, and Ignorance. \nAnd Oh the homosexual/lesbian/gender queer/gender identity crises agenda/insanity also just is another pawn in their game to destroy the few real Men left along with the concept of our current constitutional Republic based on protecting personal freedoms, privacy, and liberties.

Your buddies in the socialist nations (what we are currently becoming) have even pushed the issue to the point of offending them is a crime under ※hate speech laws§ (more like outlawing speech they hate) with a prison term because they cannot stand to have your feelings ※hurt.§ \nThis is still a constitutional republic. We still have freedom of religion and freedom of speech. We are not about to bow to the religion of Militant Liberalism and nor will we be silent about the apostasy that the reprobate are spreading across this nation. The Original Constitution was based on a very limited federal government and States Rights for a reason. So we could live in the land of freedom and opportunity with the people choosing the way they wish to be governed, Now we are at the whims of special interest groups and indoctrination systems (de-education and the media) desiring to stomp on the rights of the majority in the name of their idols called Diversity on a national level with a joke for representation. \nDon＊t worry, go vote for that whore Hitlery Clinton and she will be happy to give you a job exterminating any who refuses to worship the liberal agenda and her ideas for the new america where the original constitution For the United States ratified in 1788 is no more. Yes, that same constitution you swore to uphold. We have a Domestic Terrorist Enemy sitting in the WH and one running for the office of presidency and nobody is doing much at all.

At no way, no how are Democrats ever held accountable for anything. He may mention a few irrelevant congressional or state Dems but that is it. Obama never, Hillary never.

This why for an alternative opinion we are stuck with Talk Radio, whom i＊ll never forgive for all the hate they gave The Donald. \nMost people don＊t have the intellectual wherewithal to seek another opinion to ensure what they see/read is not slanted/a lie. Hence people are pushed a certain direction and willingly go. iris \nI think we＊re plenty intelligent enough, but have been duped through social engineering via: Public schools are actually discouraging critical thinking, questioning, independence, in favor of blind acceptance and a herd mentality. Even many Christian churches are teaching this, often, unwittingly. The MSM also reinforces this daily inundation. Also, escapism is rampant in our society. It＊s much easier to seek entertainment after a long day＊s work, or a long day of no job at all, and the longer that habit is entrenched, the harder it is to break free from it. Not saying that enjoying life is bad, it＊s very good, but so often, the acceptable forms of seeking thrills are destructive ones, in our culture. At the end of the day, we are each accountable for our lives, however. We can＊t blame everything on the forces at work, whether it＊s local or global. We can receive freedom, meaning, joy and empowerment in God. It＊s a whole different paradigm. Rastus \nWe are in a spiritual war that even most Christians do not understand.

Not even on Faux News. theShipIsSinking \nAll the Media Propaganda puppets serve the same masters along side the same agenda (Death or Enslavement for all) and this includes Faux News and many of the fake Alt Media whores like Alex Jones and David Icke. donjusko \nTrump 2016 robert \nSad to say Americans have been buying into nonsense and lies for a long, long time. The Clintons are just another sample of that along with the Bush dynasty, Obamacare, nation building, living on credit and debt etc. There is no end to what people will accept; at least enough people to put people into power. Here we go again. iris \nYes. The kingdoms of this world will never change, until Christ＊s return. And our votes may be getting hijacked, so we need to continue as individuals to look to God and do good, as He empowers us. Jodie Lynn Gaeta \nI couldn＊t care less about what some tell-all book says about Hillary. Her stance on Obamacare, illegal immigration, education, civil liberties, etc. is enough to have convinced me not to vote for her. iris \nAgree. I don＊t think she＊s competent. Letfreedomring \nAnyone else notice Hillary became the democratic nominee on 6/6/16 by winning California where the Satanists had a huge celebration today? loadnup \nYup＃ D-Day all over again with a different twist,＃ watchmannonthewall \nMichael, you＊ve made a very appropriate connection between Athaliah and Hillary. Both Jezebel and Athaliah were in power when the nations of Israel and Judah were in apostasy! Isaiah writes that God gives women to lead and children to oppress us when He judges us. (Is. 3:12) \nHillary＊s history is one of stonewalling, deception, lies, false accusations, division, in-your-face, and you can fill in all the others. I＊ve been getting updates from Judicial Watch for years on her activities and distain for our system of government and laws! \nWhether she is elected or not, no doubt the fact she is where she is confirms how far the moral standards of the nation have fallen since Gary Hart dropped out of the presidential race after the affair he had with Donna Rice became known in 1987. Less than 10 years later the people of the nation didn＊t give a rip about what extracurricular activities went on in the Oval Office, as long as the economy kept humming, and now many support evil Hillary! \nI would say God help us, but I don＊t think He is listening anymore, unless we say the right things! Abe \nYou said a mouth full!! I just got a 60 page packet from Judicial Watch from stuff 3 months ago to get us where were at today. It＊s not looking good for Broomhildary!I But she＊s made of teflon! Hopefully like Gotti and this will be her end! I hope the people are awake! Or at least enough of them. The late 50＊s to early 70＊s was pure hell! I hoped never to go through that again. I can see it rearing it＊s ugly head on the horizon, but will be worse because will have a total financial collapse along with it. get a clue \nThe Bilderbergers pick who the next puppet is. The people of the nation don＊t get what they want because we＊re slaves to BANKERS! Shabaz101 \nHey guys lets say you preferred Sanders over Hilary, now Hilary bags nomination, who is lesser evil as compared to the ※Deranged DJ Trump§ and his volatile unpredictable nature. loadnup \nYou would be well served to listen to his presentation on international affairs＃. he is not unpredictable. He is real and he says what we folks here in the daily trenches are seeing, feeling, living through. The man has done multiple acts of kindness for folks from vets, people who have lost their homes to other folks in need of expensive medical services. That tells me that his heart is in the right place as he never sought recognition for these hidden acts of mercy＃ iris \nVOTE TRUMP Put The Benghazi Murderer In Jail !. afchief \nIs Hillary a democrat? Then she is a compulsive liar. greanfinisher . \nWhatever she is, I hope it＊s not contagious. watchmannonthewall \nIt is! Evil is very contgious! Many men do not want to discipline themselves. That is why so many voted for her and support her. And the media loves her! You know what little truth they tell the American public. Again, like mind joins to like kind! The broadness and depth of her support is clear evidence, to me, the nation is lost. There was a chance to right the ship 20 years ago if the leaders and public had insisted on integrity in the presidency, as they should have. Not now! Gay Veteran \njust like any republican politician Patrick Grimes \nComparing Hillary to Athaliah or Jezebel are both good fits. Both were murderous psychopaths and both had an insatable lust for power. I don＊t see how anyone in their right mind could vote for this demonically controlled woman. In my view only those who are mentally challenged or mentally deranged or both would consider such a candidate. Rastus \nTry demonically influenced or inhabited. It will make more sense. greanfinisher . \n＆She was just really rude to almost everybody. She＊d act like she didn＊t want you around, like you were beneath her.＊ That would fit the description of any aristocrat. After all, members of the oligarchy typically are rude, arrogant and do not associate with commoners. greanfinisher . \nBest to simply sit out this rubber-stamped ＆election＊. loadnup \nAh, that＊s a big NO＃. by sitting out the election you are implying that you think hitlery and all her evil should be running this country＃. no matter how much you may hate the establishment you are ※duty§ bound to vote, that is, make your tiny voice heard even if for just that one instant in time to say ※No more§ to the festering evil around us.. watchmannonthewall \nSort of like ※Horton Hears a Who§! That one little voice may make all the difference! greanfinisher . \nI have no duty whatsoever to vote in a ＆rigged election＊ (or should I say ＆purchased＊?). All that I would be simply doing here is applying a rubber stamp on a candidate who was already pre-screened by the party＊s political bosses. By the way, I＊m hardly supporting the gun confiscatin＊ Killary horror. Bill G Wilminton NC \nIt＊s a lost cause as his own party is backing the gun confiscatin＊ racketeer. greanfinisher . \nI think that a vote for either of those two clowns would be wrong. In fact, I would even go on to say that the Republican base is just as dissatisfied with Trump as the Democratic base is with Clinton. Why would the Democrats want to ＆elect＊ a tyrant who would simply send more jobs to third world sweat shops, confiscate all firearms, tax the daylights out of the middle class, impose martial law, launch more wars, increase the national debt even further and create more havoc in the land? Don＊t blame the Democrats as they didn＊t ask for that lyin＊ witch. Of course, the Republicans have their own issues with Trump as well. JB \nI thought the parallels to Athaliah in 2 Kings was interesting. Again, ※there＊s nothing new under the sun.§ A lot of folks are putting their trust in Donald Trump, but if the Lord＊s hand is indeed involved in this and we (as a nation) are being judged, she may very well end up becoming our next leader; one can＊t go against the will of God. It＊s horrifying to read even a smidgeon of what she may have said and done in the past, yet the church continues to walk in the flesh, seemingly more interested in building larger buildings, generating funds, social programs, welcoming committees and welcoming non Christians into their congregations, embracing false teachers and false doctrines 每 in a word, a climate of apostacy, just as it was in Judah under King Jehoram. The only way out of this is if ※my people§ (the church) repents, seeks His face, chooses to walk in the Spirit, and seeks revival/ times of refreshing 每 and leaves it up to the Lord to ※heal their land.§ iris \nI hope by your saying welcoming non Christians into congregations, you＊re referring to membership. Many people who stumble into churches, being afraid, confused, or truly seeking God, hear the gospel there, and find new life in Christ Jesus. But I so agree, if you meant membership. There are plenty of ※Christian§ pastors and priests in certain denominations, which have stated that they either don＊t believe in God, or that their belief system is so inclusive as to deny the efficacy of Christ＊s finished work on the Cross as the only way of salvation. \nThis is an aside, but   licentiousness and legalism are the two sides of one coin. Rastus \nPlease, briefly explain your aside. iris \nWell, here＊s an example. After coming to faith in college, I stumbled into a church which believed the whole Bible was inspired, and the final authority, which I was glad to hear, (and still believe) and got immediately involved. 3 years into that denomination, and in one of their Bible colleges, I realized that they were almost completely legalistic, and that this was definitely not how I first knew Jesus Christ. I left church altogether for a few years, (not Jesus, but was leery of church at that point). God helped me through that time, and I started going back to church, but never that denomination again. It has been 35? years since I had dealings with it, but in reading about them now, one would never recognize them, as they have changed their positions on several major fronts, but again, from a man-centered perspective, and now are quite liberal in certain areas, and not in a good way. I think this change has been about money and church growth. \nI don＊t think legalists realize their hypocrisy, and usually mean well, but it＊s grace + nothing, for me. He who began a good work in me will be faithful to complete it until the day of the Lord Jesus, Philippians 1:6. My hope is in Him, and not in myself. The more I walk that way, the same way i was walking in Christ at first, the more joy, peace, love and righteousness come from my life. But the opposite happens when I revert back to the old nature of earning, proving, appearances, etc., and the ways and things of the world seem to present a stronger temptation for me. \nI think the move towards practicing contemplative meditation, also known as ※holy yoga§ in Christian circles, might be an expected outcome for someone who has subscribed to the grace + works doctrines. Imo, that is another work, according to what I＊ve heard some of them say. They are trying to grow spiritually, get closer to God through this ※practice§, rather than resting in faith in Christ alone, and His finished work on the Cross. iris \nThere＊s a good book on the subject of spiritual abuse, by Jeff VanVonderen, a Christian counselor and former pastor. The Subtle Power of Spiritual Abuse. He＊s also written other books, one on breaking free from substance addiction, and is a recovered addict, himself. He has a lot of humor, humility and logic and is good about showing the contrast between grace and faith vs works and sin. \n  as we walk in faith, we will be keeping the Law, but that it can＊t happen the other way around. \nGod bless, and thanks for asking! loadnup \n※§Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.§ Between the truth that ※Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear,§ and the throngs clambering for more bread and circus who have nothing to do with any organized religion (not that all those who attend church have an abiding faith in the one Triune God) we are surrounded by the abomination of a kind of desolation that brings destruction to our very doors＃. pray, prep and protect. carson \nif their putting their trust in don trump＃then jeremiah 17:5＃?＃.!! watchmannonthewall \nGreat verse!

RageHard84 \nYou could be right. DJohn1 \nI seldom see you commit yourself anymore when it comes to politics. That is what makes this article so unusual. I changed political parties this election. I have been in the past a Democrat. No more. I guess the major question will be who is likely to do the least amount of damage if elected. So far Donald Trump may be the person who will do the least amount of damage though not by much. Hillary will lead us right into world war III if I am right. Bernie is likely to bankrupt what is left of this country with socialism. Trump might actually straighten up and fly right with the team he puts together. Then there is the great unknown. Meaning the people that become vice presidents. Never forget we are one heart beat away from that person taking office. I think I would look real close this election to whomever is appointed as the vice candidate. I think what scares people the most is the archie bunkerisms that Donald has spouted. We are at the end of an age. The new age being born will happen in January. Remember one thing. Donald Trump has accomplished more with less money than any candidate in history. That is a form of genius. I have been in voted office before. I was one of the most successful people at it that there was in a very small pond. The only reason I succeeded was I was dead honest about everything. I prayed a lot. Secretly for the most part. I wasn＊t ashamed. I simply followed scripture. The other reason was the good Lord showed me what to do. He helped me pick a really good team to back me up. And that is what I hope Donald will do. Pick a really good team. And when things go down the toilet in a hurry. I suggest you go somewhere quiet and ask God what to do. Never advertise it. That is a form of using God. He doesn＊t like that. I can think of at least 5 times when things looked hopeless and God made it come back and I won. And that is what it will take given the circumstances we find ourselves facing after the next election. None of the current people running have done that much. IF Donald picks a good team and wins then it will come out whether or not he is the leader I think he may be. The most likely thing that will happen is Bernie Sanders will become President because Hillary will go to jail. If Donald does win, that will be a minor miracle",

    "title": "Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 2016 In Their Own Words",
    "text": "Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 2016 In Their Own Words 2016 Election Through the Eyes of Prophecy \nBy Dave Robbins \n\nAs we approach the presidential election on November 8, 2016 I don＊t think the candidates could be more divided. \n\nOne is pro-life, the other is pro-choice. One is pro-gun, while the other is anti-gun. One believes global warming is a hoax, and the other claims the science is settled. One wants to build a wall, while the other is essentially for opening the borders. One believes in a traditional marriage between one man and one woman, while the other supports same-sex marriage. And the list goes on and on. \n\nEach of these issues is certainly important and should be considered before making a final decision on who to vote for in November. \n\nHowever, for those who follow prophecy, this upcoming election goes beyond that. Knowing that a world government is prophesied for the near future, one area that we are following closely is the ongoing process of globalization. (moving toward a global governing system) \n\nIt is possible that this upcoming election will set the course of the United States of America on a path toward either full involvement or total dissention from this prophesied world government. If everyone understood the prophecies concerning the future global political authority, the entire election would be determined on that issue alone. That is why we chose to devote an entire article to that subject in this magazine. \n\nAnd yes, one candidate is vehemently opposed to globalization, while the other supports it in every way. \n\nSince the next President of the United States will serve at least a four-year term, and quite possibly eight, we thought it would be important to let you see where each candidate stands on the important issues. \n\nWhy? With all the prophecies converging at the same time, it is likely that the next president will be in office during some of the most significant prophetic fulfillments concerning the end time. \n\nAlthough there are more technical issues at hand (i.e. taxes, infrastructure, job creation, etc.), these do not necessarily show the character of an individual. That is why we have chosen the more defining topics which let us see the person behind the persona. In our opinion, these are the most critical. \n\nTherefore, instead of giving you my opinion, I will let the candidates speak for themselves＃ Abortion \nTrump: Pro-Life \n\nAre you pro-life? Mr. Trump, ※Yes＃It＊s an issue. I mean it＊s an issue, and it＊s a strong issue＃What I am saying is this: With caveats 每 life of the mother, incest, rape. That＊s where I stand. So, I＊m pro-life, but with the caveats. You have to have it with the caveats.§ Pregnancy outside of those caveats? Mr. Trump stated, ※It depends why?§ ※I＊m, pro-life＃very simple, pro-life.§ [i] \n\n※＃friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn＊t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child. And I saw that. And I saw other instances. And I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life.§ [ii] \n\nClinton: Pro-Choice \n\n※Politicians have no business interfering with women＊s personal health decisions. I will oppose efforts to roll back women＊s access to reproductive health care, including Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. As president, I＊ll stand up for Planned Parenthood and women＊s access to critical health services, including safe, legal abortion,§ [iii] \n\n※The unborn person doesn＊t have constitutional rights.§ [iv] \n\n※I believe we need to protect access to safe and legal abortion, not just in principle, but in practice.§ [v] Climate Change \nTrump: ※It＊s a Hoax＃§ \n\nOn December 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., ※Obama＊s talking about all of this with the global warming and＃a lot of it＊s a hoax. It＊s a hoax. I mean, it＊s a money-making industry, okay? It＊s a hoax, a lot of it.§ [vi] \n\nIn an ※Energy Policy§ speech in North Dakota on May 26, 2016 Trump stated, ※＃rescind all the job-destroying Obama executive actions including the Climate Action Plan＃We＊re going to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.§ [vii] \n\n※There has been a big push to develop alternative forms of energy每so-called green energy每from renewable sources. That＊s a big mistake. To begin with, the whole push for renewable energy is being driven by the wrong motivation, the mistaken belief that global climate change is being caused by carbon emissions. If you don＊t buy that每and I don＊t每then what we have is really just an expensive way of making the tree-huggers feel good about themselves.§ [viii] \n\nClinton: The Science is Settled. \n\n※It＊s hard to believe that people running for president refuse to believe the settled science of climate change.§ [ix] \n\n※I believe in science. I believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.§ [x] \n\n※Go talk to a scientist!§ she said. ※I really am tired of the debate, which is a phony debate. Climate change is real. It is here. It has to be dealt with.§ [xi] Gun Control \nTrump: Pro-Gun \n\n※The Second Amendment to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Period＃The Second Amendment guarantees a fundamental right that belongs to all law-abiding Americans. The Constitution doesn＊t create that right 每 it ensures that the government can＊t take it away. Our Founding Fathers knew, and our Supreme Court has upheld, that the Second Amendment＊s purpose is to guarantee our right to defend ourselves and our families. This is about self-defense, plain and simple＃It＊s been said that the Second Amendment is America＊s first freedom. That＊s because the Right to Keep and Bear Arms protects all our other rights. We are the only country in the world that has a Second Amendment.§ [xii] \n\nClinton: Anti-Gun \n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos asked, ※Do you believe that an individual＊s right to bear arms is a constitutional right; that it＊s not linked to service in a militia?§ Mrs. Clinton replied, ※I think that for most of our history there was a nuanced reading of the Second Amendment until the decision by the late Justice (Antonin) Scalia. And there was no argument until then that localities and states and the federal government had a right 每 as we do with every amendment 每 to impose reasonable regulations. So I believe we can have common-sense gun safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment＃But I＊m going to continue to speak out for comprehensive background checks; closing the gun show loophole; closing the online loophole; closing the so-called Charleston loophole; reversing the bill that Sen. (Bernie) Sanders voted for and I voted against, giving immunity from liability to gun makers and sellers. I think all of that can and should be done, and it is, in my view, consistent with the Constitution.§ [xiii] \n\n※When it comes to guns, we have just too many guns,§ Clinton said. ※On the streets, in our homes, in our neighborhoods.§ [xiv] \n\n※I am not here to make promises I can＊t keep. I am here to tell you I will use every single minute of every day, if I am so fortunate enough to be your president, looking for ways that we can save lives, that we can change the gun culture＃It is just too easy for people to reach for a gun to settle their problems. It makes no sense.§ [xv] \n\n※I was proud when my husband took [the National Rifle Association] on, and we were able to ban assault weapons, but he had to put a sunset on so, 10 years later, of course [President George W.] Bush wouldn＊t agree to reinstate them＃We＊ve got to go after this＃And here again, the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. And I am going to make that case every chance I get.§ [xvi] \n\n※I don＊t know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work, but certainly the Australia example is worth looking at,§ Clinton said at a New Hampshire town hall＃The Australian program reduced the number of firearms in circulation by implementing a gun buy-back plan for citizens. [xvii] Immigration \nTrump: ※I will Build a Great, Great Wall＃§ \n\n※You cannot have＃illegal immigration. You don＊t have a country if you have that＃As has been stated continuously in the press, people are pouring across our borders unabated. Public reports routinely state great amounts of crime are being committed by illegal immigrants. This must be stopped and it must be stopped now.§ [xviii] \n\n※I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.§ [xix] \n\nMr. Trump responded to a question on mass deportation: ※No, I would not call it mass deportations＃We＊re going to do it (deport illegals) in a very humane fashion. Believe me. I have a bigger heart than you do. We＊re going to do it in a very humane fashion＃I want terrorists out. I want people that have bad thoughts out. I would limit specific terrorist countries, and we know who those terrorist countries are.§ [xx] \n\nClinton: ※We will not Build a Wall.§ \n\n※We will not build a wall. Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good paying job can get one. And we＊ll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy＃I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to kick them out.§ [xxi] \n\n※In 2003, I sponsored the DREAMER (sic) Act. I sponsored I think in every Congress after that. I have been consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.§ [xxii] \n\nMrs. Clinton made this statement concerning Syrian refugees: ※We＊re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II and I think the United States has to do more＃I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 (incoming refugees) and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in.§ [xxiii] \n\n※I would stop (deportations) of the undocumented (illegal) people living in our country,§ Clinton responded. ※I do not want to see them deported＃I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That＊s exactly what I will do.§ [xxiv] \n\n※You can count on me to defend President Obama＊s executive actions on DACA and DAPA when I am president,§ Clinton said, referring to Obama＊s 2012 (DACA) and 2014 (DAPA) executive amnesties, which gave work permits and access to federal benefits to millions of illegal immigrants. [xxv] Obamacare \nTrump: ※＃Repeal and Replace Obamacare＃§ \n\nSpeaking at the Iowa Freedom Summit in January 2015, Mr. Trump stated, ※Someone has to repeal and replace Obamacare＃ (Obamacare is) a total catastrophe. It kicks in in 2016 and it will be a disaster. People are closing shops. Doctors are quitting the business. I have a friend who was a doctor and he says he has more accountants than patients. He needs that because it is complicated and terrible.§ [xxvi] \n\n※We are going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better.§ [xxvii] \n\nClinton: ※I will Defend the Affordable Care Act＃§ \n\n※I will defend the Affordable Care Act, but as president I want to go further＃I want to strengthen the Affordable Care Act.§ [xxviii] \n\n※You know, before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare＃§I am a staunch supporter of President Obama＊s principal accomplishment, namely the Affordable Care Act.§ [xxix] \n\nConcerning Obamacare for illegal immigrants: ※There are two steps here. If someone can afford to pay for an insurance policy off the exchanges that were set up under the Affordable Care Act, I support that. If they can afford it, they should be able to go into the marketplace and buy it. However, it is not going to apply to people who are in need of subsidies in order to afford that＃What I do want to see is that we have more options for undocumented (illegal) people to be able to get the health care they need＃It＊s not only the right and moral thing to do for them. It＊s also important that we keep ourselves healthy, and public health requires that. So I see this as a two-step process.§ [xxx] Warrantless Surveillance/Database \nTrump: Bulk Data Collection is Fine \n\nMr. Trump said that he would be ※fine§ with restoring provisions of the Patriot Act to allow for the bulk data collection. ※As far as I＊m concerned, that would be fine,§ Trump said. [xxxi] \n\nMr. Trump also told the Daily Signal , ※I support legislation which allows the NSA to hold the bulk metadata. For oversight, I propose that a court, which is available any time on any day, is created to issue individual rulings on when this metadata can be accessed.§ [xxxii] \n\nClinton: Does not Regret Her Vote on Patriot Act \n\nConcerning plans for expanded online surveillance of potential extremist attackers: ※We already know we need more resources for this fight. The professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out＃That＊s why I＊ve proposed an ＆intelligence surge＊ to bolster our capabilities across the board, with appropriate safeguards here at home.§ [xxxiii] \n\nDuring the Democratic Presidential debate on October 13, 2015 Anderson Cooper asked: ※Governor Chafee, you and Hillary Clinton both voted for the Patriot Act which created the NSA surveillance program. You＊ve emphasized civil liberties, privacy during your campaign＃Secretary Clinton, do you regret your vote on the Patriot Act?§ \n\nClinton replied, ※No, I don＊t. I think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 9/11 to put in place the security that we needed. And it is true that it did require that there be a process. What happened, however, is that the Bush administration began to chip away at that process. And I began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in. We always have to keep the balance of civil liberties, privacy and security. It＊s not easy in a democracy, but we have to keep it in mind.§ [xxxiv] \n\n※Well, the NSA has to act lawfully. And we as a country have to decide what the rules are. And then we have to make it absolutely clear that we＊re going to hold them accountable. What we had because of post-9/11 legislation was a lot more flexibility than I think people really understood, and was not explained to them.§ [xxxv] Real ID/National ID",

She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades. \nHillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election, I am fully convinced that World War III will begin before her time in the White House is over. \nSomeone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump.

    "text": "A Hillary Clinton goon destroyed Donald Trump＊s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nThe ※peaceful man§ said that he had 4-5 family members assaulted and that hes terrible upset that he has a presidential nominee who is a ※poster child for sexual violence§. People were standing around and filming his ※brave act§, we imagine it took several minutes to accomplish this, yet no one intervened, no one called the cops.\nMost of the fake accusers have already been debunked but batshit crazed liberals still push on the narrative that Trump is a rapist.\nThis is a classic tactic from Saul Alinsky of whom Hillary Clinton idolized and based her college thesis on. Divert attention away from your issues with the same issue but falsely accusing it on your opponent. Nice!\nSo Hillary wants to divert attention away from her open marriage and from her husband＊s rapes of multiple women with false accusations of Trump. Make no mistake about it, this is not a Trump issue. She would have done the same thing with any other opponent. If it were Ted Cruz, same story, if he would have exposed Bill Clinton＊s rapes, the next week you would have had multiple women falsely accusing Ted Cruz of raping and groping them. Unbelievable!\nThe vandal identified himself as James Otis and he removed the emblem from the middle of the star to sell it and donate the money to all the women who were raped by Trump.\nYou would think that in the light of Project Veritas videos and how they exposed the DNC evil who paid agitators, violence, voter fraud and more they would chill out for a while but nope, the viciousness is going on. These people are pushing the limits of law in this country and as of now its a banana republic led by banana-boy Obama but if Trump gets in, a lot of people are RIGHTFULLY going to be locked up and have the key thrown away for all this chaos, anarchy and lawlessness.\nLAPD is currently searching for the vandalism suspect.\nTrump received his star in 2007. In July 2016 a protester built a 6-inch wall around the star which is a legitimate form of protest, but destroying the star is just anarchy and that man needs to be locked up for a while along with the Democrats who paid him to do that.\nThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said they are planning to repair the star. Well at least they have some honor in them.\n※People can make a difference by voting and not destroying public property§ the chamber＊s president said.\nThese sort of things are normally expected to happen in poor countries with little to no freedoms where the opposition party is systematically oppressed but in a country like America which brags to the world how it is ※the greatest democracy in the world§ it is surely setting a bad example which no one in its right mind would like to follow.\nIf it has come to the point that even the communist state press in China is saying that what the media in America is doing to Trump is pure bias, then we know how bad it is in America.\nThe media people in America are rubbing their hands at this one. They are truly happy and excited this happened.",

She stopped in front of the step, raised her hand, turned her head over to see if the guy is there and waited to grab his hand. He immediately rushed towards her and helped her out. See for yourself:\n\nAlso, remember this scene from last month at 9/11 in New York where she completely collapsed? She was all frozen up, like a peace of wood, a plank or something. They just dragged her like a corpse:\n\nHundreds of top doctors came out and confirmed that she has brain damage and is not fit for office.

You went on to say that the Clintons have a high body count. Do you believe that the Clintons really are killing people?＊\nShe responded by saying: ＆You know, sometimes we look at patterns and we look at things that are happening and sometimes you can＊t dismiss everything as a conspiracy.＊\nWeinstein then asked Lahren if she was referring to the conspiracy theory held by some that the Clintons were somehow responsible for the death of Vince Foster, a close friend of the couple who was found dead in 1993 of what was later ruled to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n＆The list 每 I will let your listeners go on and look at some of these examples and they can decide for themselves,＊ said Lahren.\n＆But there＊s been some mysterious circumstances that have surrounded 每 we just saw, what with the DNC leaks and then what happened to a person that worked for the DNC that was in charge of that?＊\nLahren was referring to the death of Seth Rich, who was murdered near his home in Washington DC this past July.\nSoon after, DailyMail.com learned that he was set to start working for Hillary＊s campaign.\nWeinstein pointed out to Lahren that Rich＊s parents said they do not suspect anything ＆suspicious,＊ to which she replied: ＆Well, his family doesn＊t want to be in a body bag either, Jamie.\n＆I have got to be honest with you. What was it? He came in and was robbed, but his wallet and his watch weren＊t taken? So he was robbed and what was he＃＊\nAnd another claim: ＆Sometimes you can＊t dismiss everything as a conspiracy,＊ said Lahren (Clinton above with Vince Foster, whose death Lahren also finds mysterious)\nOne more claim: Lahren also spoke about the death of DNC worker Seth Rich (above), saying his parents are keeping quiet out of fear of ending up in a ＆body bag＊\nAt this point Weinsten jumped in to say: ＆You think he might have been killed by the Clintons?＊\nLahren responded to this by stating: ＆I don＊t know if he was killed by the Clintons or a Clinton hit person. I＊m not going to sit here and be what you want me to be which is a conspiracy theorist, but I will say＃＊\nWeinsten then cut in briefly to point out he was just asking Lahren questions.\nLahren continued: ※I think there are a lot of circumstances that surround the Clinton family that aren＊t explainable and I will let people go on and research it for themselves.

    "text": "A stunning Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today reveals that the Security Council (SC), this morning, authorized the sending to the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of an emergency communiqu?? requesting an immediate explanation as to why Hillary Clintona?s money laundering organization, known as the Clinton Foundation, this past week, purchased over $137 million of illegal arms and ammunitiona§and whose destination is to be the United States, with delivery being marked as a?mid-November 2016a?. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\nAccording to this report, SVR analysts began expressing a?urgent concerna? earlier this year when the main a?elements/factionsa? of the feared Viktor Bouta?s international arms smuggling crime organization began arriving in the Republic of Albaniaa§that is the only Muslim nation in Europe.\nViktor Bout, this report explains, is most popularly known in the West as the a?Lord of Wara? for his workings with the CIA to smuggle illegal weapons throughout the world to further the maniacal interests of the United Statesa§until 2011 when then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had him jailed.\nThough a citizen of the Federation, this report continues, the SVR had no a?complaint/concerna? with Hillary Clinton having Bout jailed for 25 years as it was an internal matter of the CIAa§but whose intelligence analysts expressed a?worry/confusiona? this past May (2016) when US Federal Judge Shira Scheindlin said he should have had a reduced sentencea§and that led, yesterday, to Bout a?suddenly/magicallya? being transferred out of maximum security to the a?country club atmospherea? of the general ward of the US Federal Prison hea?s been confined to.\nCIA illegal arms smuggler Viktor Bout\nCoinciding with Bouta?s a?mysterious/magicala? prison transfer yesterday, this report notes, was Hillary Clintona?s money laundering Clinton Foundation transferring $137.7 million to the Socialist Party of Albania (SPA) controlled by that nations Prime Minister Edi Ramaa§who is not only the head of the Xhakja Clan (known in the West as the Albanian Mafia) but who was, also, and shockingly, put into power by the Obama-Clinton regime over the protests of the Albanian people who did not want a a?mafia governmenta? controlling them.\nHillary Clinton (left) and Albanian Xhakja Clan mafia crime leader Edi Rama (right)\nWith Hillary Clintona?s international arms merchant Prime Minister Rama having turned the entire Balkan region into one of the worlda?s largest areas for arms smuggling that now threatens its very security, this report warns, she has been aided in this effort by what many are calling her a?puppet mastera?a§the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros that recently released, and shocking, secret emails show him ordering Hillary Clinton to install this mafia criminal as the leader of Albania.\nTo fully understand why Hillary Clinton made this massive arms purchase, and no doubt was aided in doing so by the CIAa?s arms smuggler Viktor Bout, SVR analysts in this report explain, is her adherence to George Sorosa?s radical vision of open bordersa§and that he singlehandedly began implementing by creating the European refugee crisis that will, likewise, engulf the United States should Hillary Clinton become president, and as exactly as her secret emails reveals she plans on doing.\nAlso, this report continues, and as the Federation knows all to well, the Soros-Clinton a?master plana? to take down a nation begins with the establishment of what are called Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) to act as a a?shadow governmenta? ready to take power once the established order is thrown into chaos by massive protestsa§and why, in 2013, President Putin banned them from operating in Russia.\nIn the United States, however, this report grimly states, the American people have no defense against these a?shadow governmenta? NGOa?sa§and that SVR intelligence assests have documented in this report as being the a?receiving partiesa? of Hillary Clintona?s massive arms purchase and include the George Soros created NGOa?s called: Open Society Foundations, Media Matters, American Institute for Social Justice, The New America Foundation, The Migration Policy Institute, Tides Foundation, Center for American Progress, and the Democracy Alliancea§every single one of which stands violently opposed to the US Constitution and the American people.\nOnce these weapons are in the hands of Hillary Clintona?s a?new revolutionariesa?, this report continues, they will then be used to unleash a a?terror wavea? across America protesting Donald Trumpa?s landslide victorya§thus enabling President Obama to declare martial law to disarm all of these people, and once doing so, allow the US Electors to place Hillary Clinton in power. [Note: American presidents are NOT elected by the voting of citizens, but by the vote of the Electors selected from each of that nations 50 States.]\nThis report sadly concludes, though, by noting that the massive vote fraud already being committed by Hillary Clintona?s a?new revolutionariesa? throughout the United States, and that led this past week to former US Congressman Joe Walsh stunningly stating a?If Trump loses, I＊m grabbing my musketa?a§a reference to one of the darkest times in American history when that nationa?s ordinary citizens banded together to fight the British Empire for their freedoma§should strike fear into all Americans of what Hillary Clintona?s a?new revolutionariesa? are doing right nowa§and if not, nothing will.",

I＊ve responded to all w/ essentially the following (ie disintermediating myself, again, emphatically) below. I also called my Dad last night to tell him of my explicit non-involvement and pushing all back to you both and to him as I think that is indeed the right answer. Thanks\nSample: Please share any and all concerns, with examples, without pulling punches, with John and Cheryl as appropriate and also if you feel very strongly with my Dad directly. Transitions are always challenging and to get to the right answer its critical that voices are heard and understood, and in the most direct way 每 ie to them without intermediation. Particularly in an effort to move more toward a professionalism and efficiency at the Foundation and for my father 每 and they＊re the decision-makers, my Dad most of all.\nA February 2015 email from Neera Tanden lashes out at David Brock of the Bonner Group, profiled in this post: ※ Money Laundering Scheme Exposed: 14 Pro-Clinton Super PACs & Non-Profits Implicated. § As a reminder, the Bonner Group, as we showed last month, may be a money laundering front involving various SuperPACs and non-profit institutions:\n\nIn the email Tanden says that:\n※Brock/Bonner are a nightmare: Really, Suzie Buell isn＊t giving to the superpac? I wonder how that got in this story ※ Big donors holding off making pledges to pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC ※,\nand concludes by saying that ※ Sometimes HRC/WJC have the worst judgement. §\n\nIn retrospect, she is right.\n* * *\nSpeaking of ※donor advisor§ Mary Pat Bonner , the following email from March 2009 hints at potential impropriety in shifting money from one democratic donor group to another, the Center for American Progress :\nI have moved all the sussman money from unity ＊09 to cap and am reviewing the others. I will assess it and keep you informed\nSomething else for the DOJ to look into after the elections, perhaps?\n* * *\nAnd then there is this email from August 2015 in which German politician Michael Werz advises John Podesta that Turkish president Erdogan ※is making substantial investments in U.S. to counter opposition (CHP, Kurds, Gulenists etc.) outreach to policymakers§ and the US Government.\nJohn, heard this second hand but more than once. Seems Erdogan faction is making substantial investments in U.S. to counter opposition (CHP, Kurds, Gulenists etc.) outreach to policymakers and USG. Am told that the Erdogan crew also tries to make inroads via donations to Democratic candidates, including yours. Two names that you should be aware of are *Mehmet Celebi* and *Ali Cinar*. Happy to elaborate on the phone, provided you are not shopping at the liquor store.\nThe email :\n\nThis should perhaps explain why the US has so far done absolutely nothing to halt Erdogan＊s unprecedented crackdown on ※coup plotters§ which has seen as many as 100,000 workers lose their jobs, be arrested, or otherwise removed from Erdogan＊s political opposition.\nSource",

    "text": "In today＊s, 25th, Wikileaks release of hacked Podesta emails, one of the notable highlights is a March 2, 2015 exchange between John Podesta and Clinton aide Cheryl Mills in which the Clinton Campaign Chair says ※ On another matter＃.and not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails. §\nBack in July 2016, FBI didn＊t go after Hillary because director Comey said ※didn＊t find any intent§. Well here＊s your ※intent§ thanks to Wikileaks.\nThe email, which may indicate intent, was sent at the same time as the NYT story ※ Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept., Possibly Breaking Rules § 每 which for the first time revealed the existence of Hillary＊s email server 每 hit, and just days before Hillary＊s press conference addressing what was at the time, the stunning revelation that she had a personal email account, and server, in her home.\nThe proposed ※dumping§ on March 2 takes place two days before the House Select Committee on Benghazi sent Hillary Clinton a document retention subpoena on March 4, 2015, with some hinting the NYT report may have served to tip off the Clinton campaign about the upcoming subpoena.\nMills＊ response to Podesta: ※Think you just got your new nick name.§\nIt is unclear which ※Lanny§ is referred to: the infamous former DOJ staffer Lanny Breuer who quit in January 2013 after telling Frontline that some banks are too big to fail, or, more likely Lanny Davis, special counsel to President Bill Clinton, and spokesperson for the President and the White House on matters concerning campaign-finance investigations and other legal issues\nIt is also unclear 每 for now 每 which emails Podesta is referring to in the thread, but Podesta adds: ※better to do so sooner than later.§ We can hope that a subsequent response, yet to be leaked by Wikileaks, will provide more color.\nIf the exchange is shown to disclose intent to mislead, it will negate the entire narrative prepared by Clinton that she merely deleted ※personal§ emails and will reveal a strategic plan to hinder the State Department and FBI ※investigation.§\nThis is the first time that particular exchange has emerged among the Podesta emails.\nFurthermore, a search for Lanny Davis reveals the following curious exchange between Robby Mook and John Podesta from March 8, 2015, just days after the abovementioned exchange, in which Mook says:\nWe gotta zap Lanny out of our universe. Can＊t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.\nIt seems the Clinton campaign was not happy with being set on a course of transparency by Bill Clinton＊s special counsel.\nFinally, in a separate email sent out in the first week of March 2015 , by Clinton campaign communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, we get yet another confirmation that the president actively mislead the public when he said he didn＊t know Hillary was using a private email address:\nSuggest Philippe talk to Josh or Eric. They know POTUS and HRC emailed. Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm. I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet＊s email addresses.\nPerhaps while the DOJ/FBI is taking a second look into Huma Abedin＊s emails, it can also take a repeat look at some of these, especially the ones involving POTUS.\nSource",

    "title": "FBI debunks Hillary's Conspiracy Theory: Trump is NOT a Russian Agent",
    "text": "FBI officials say their investigation into links between US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Russia has been unable to uncover any so far, according to the New York Times.\nThe bureau has been trying to find evidence showing that the Russian government is trying to influence the US presidential campaign since the beginning of summer. FBI agents have put advisers close to GOP candidate Donald Trump under close scrutiny, searching for financial connections that some have alleged exist between the nominee and Russian financial figures. They even followed up on a lead hinting that there had been a secret email correspondence between Trumpa?s Organization and Russiaa?s Alfa-bank. All the while, the bureau has been searching for the hackers that breached the computers of the Democratic camp and leaked emails that became the source of many scandals damaging to Democratic candidate Hillary Clintona?s campaign.\nNonetheless, the FBI still cannot say that any of its investigations have uncovered direct links between Trump and Russian authorities, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing recent interviews and its own bureau sources.\na?No evidence has emerged that would link [Trump] or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russiaa?s election operations,a? writes the NYT.\nOfficials also anonymously told the NYT that whoever the hackers were, the attacks were aimed at disrupting the presidential race on the whole, and not boosting Trumpa?s chances of getting into the Oval Office, as the Western media and Democrats have been claiming.\nIn explaining why Russia would want to interfere in the campaign, one senior official was cited as saying, a?It isna?t about the electiona? Ita?s about a threat to democracy.a?\nThe FBIa?s inquiries will continue, however. In interviews over the past several weeks, intelligence officials have signaled that they have opened a larger probe to look into suspicions over connections between Trump aides and Moscow.\nIn the most recent lead, an anonymous computer scientist going by the name Tea Leaves found some 2,700 a?look-upa? messages that tied a server being used by one of Donald Trumpa?s companies to those of Russiaa?s Alfa Bank.\nStill, the FBI found that there was no two-way communication, and these messages could have been marketing emails or spam. Both the Trump campaign and Alfa Bank issued statements denying that they had been in communication.\n\nThe FBI is also probing Trumpa?s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose foreign business and political dealings have come under scrutiny since reports surfaced claiming he was involved with a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, NBC reported, citing intelligence sources.\na?Russia hackinga? vs Clinton emails \nA separate report from CNBC citing a former FBI official claims that the bureaua?s director, James Comey, was privately reluctant about naming Russia as the entity responsible for meddling in the US election campaign, reportedly saying it was too close to the November 8 Election Day.\nIn the beginning of October, Comey allegedly concluded that a?a foreign power was trying to undermine the election,a? but arguing against putting it out before the election itself.\nHe also allegedly made sure that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was not mentioned in the document compiled by the US government on October 7, which officially accused Russia of a?authorizinga? the hacking of emails accounts of US officials and organizations, out of concern that the FBI would be seen as interfering with the election if it was included.\nHowever, last Friday, with the election mere days away, Comey announced that the bureau was reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton because several hundred thousand new emails that may be related to the private server used by the Democratic nominee had allegedly been discovered.\nThe announcement, which left many in the government puzzled, has already resulted in official complaints and attacks from the entire US political spectrum. On Monday, some 100 former federal prosecutors and senior Department of Justice officials, including Attorney General Eric Holder, signed a letter expressing concern over Comeya?s decision to reopen the case a?on the eve of a major election,a? as a?the mere disclosure of information may impact the electiona?s outcomea? at this stage.\nClintona?s supporters have accused Comey of deliberately hiding a?explosivea? information about Trumpa?s alleged ties to Russia, demanding that he discuss them publicly, just as he did with the new batch of Clinton-related emails.\nHillary Clinton and her supporters have repeatedly criticized Trump for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Trump has retorted that he has a?nothing to doa? with Russia and doesna?t know its leader personally.\nPutin on accusations of meddling: a?rubbisha? \nRussia, in turn, has denied having any links to the Trump camp on numerous occasions, while refuting accusations that it had been behind the hacking attacks on the Democrats, with Russian President Vladimir Putin calling them a?rubbisha? last week.\na?The image [that Russia supports a candidate in the US presidential election] was created by the media,a? Putin said at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi last Thursday, stressing that this had been done deliberately.\na?This is complete and utter rubbish, and it is just a method of internal political struggle, as well as a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential elections,a? he added, while explaining that Russia does not prefer any particular candidate and is ready to work with either of them. Russiaa?s president also stressed that friendly words and intentions to normalize relations between the US and Russia are always welcome, a?whoever expresses them.a?\nSource",

    "text": "The Libertarian Party has been shooting itself in the foot since the beginning with large amounts of misstatements, judgement errors and wrong policies, but now they finally decided to shoot themselves in the head.\nWhat Libertarian VP Bill Weld just did, is going to destroy and bury the Libertarian Party forever. There is no going back from this one.\nI mean, WHAT IS ALEPPO??? , I guess I＊m having an Aleppo moment (when being asked to name a single foreign leader), sticking his tongue at a woman who interviewed him , having mental collapse reactions on camera , are imbecilic errors which some followers could forgive but no one can forgive this one.\nSo this is what the Libertarian movement was all about. Total stupidity, betrayal and cuckoldry!\nRon Paul, chief Libertarian cuckold whom we strongly supported back in the past (and you can search and look at our older 2008-2012 articles as proof that we actually DID strongly supported him) endorsed the Libertarian Party first on CNN and then on FOX Business clowns Bill Weld and Gary Johnson who threw a George Washington gun replica in the garbage , pledged to sign TPP , open borders plus many others and now this, clown number 2: Bill Weld directly endorsing Hillary Clinton.\nLibertarian vice presidential candidate Bill Weld is under fire from members of his own party and from GOP after espousing support for Democrat presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. Appearing on MSNBC＊s The Rachel Madcow Show Tuesday, Weld told Libertarian voters in the battleground state of North Carolina to instead give their vote to Hillary, claiming ※Donald Trump is a threat to the country§. Sure he is! He＊s a THREAT to corruption and that＊s exactly why the people want him.\n※We are making our case that we＊re fiscally responsible and socially inclusive and welcoming and we think we got on the merits the best ticket of the three parties if you will. And so we＊d like to get there.§\n※Having said that as I think you＊re aware I see a big difference between the R candidate and the D candidate and I＊ve been at some pains to say that I fear for the country if Mr. Trump should be elected. I think it＊s a candidacy without any parallel that I can recall. It＊s content-free and very much given to stirring up envy and resentment and even hatred. I think it would be a threat to the conduct of our foreign policy and our position in the world at large.§\nStating voters in North Carolina may decide the outcome of the 2016 election, Madcow asked why a Libertarian voter fearing Trump should vote for Hillary rather than Weld and his running mate Gary Johnson.\n※I＊m here vouching for Mrs. Clinton,§ Weld told Maddow, ※and I think it＊s high time somebody did.§\nEarlier this year, Weld said he would dedicate remaining efforts in the campaign toward staving off a Trump presidency.\n※The libertarians are reaching levels of cuckoldry never thought possible,§ writes Chris Menahan for Information Liberation .\nAfter this one, the Libertarian movement is DEAD, the very heads of the Libertarian movement, Ron Paul, Gary Johnson and Bill Weld killed the movement! Libertarians are disgusting cucks who like to watch their wives getting kissed by other men (censored version). And this is exactly what they are, cucks! Just watch the photo above, who in the world names their WI-FI ※Cuckoo§??? They even spelled WI-FI ※Wifi§ with small letters and no minus line. Someone who would read it fast without paying too much attention, could end up reading ※Wife: Cuckold§. You can＊t make this stuff up!\nThey like to watch the Constitution, morality, ethics, principles being screwed by Hillary Clinton!\nLibertarians/cuckservatives: muh principles!\nWe, the EU Times: Well what＊s your principles?\nLibertarians/cuckservatives: Open borders, TPP, destruction of 2nd Amendment, Christian oppression and Muslim immigration, pro-abortion, outsourcing of jobs, not standing up to government corruption and vote rigging! Define those principles of yours you cuckolds!\nRon Paul is a disgrace for supporting this cuckoldry! We disavow Ron Paul and we SPIT on all his previous work! We regret ever supporting him! Ron Paul got himself rich with millions of dollars in grassroots donations and when they stole votes from him (and they did steal from Ron Paul) the weakling cuck that he is didn＊t had the courage to stand up to himself and to his voters and say or do something. He＊s a snake just as bad as Ted Cruz and Glenn Beck!\nThe Libertarians are DEAD, Long live the Nationalists!

    "text": "A WikiLeak＊s email released on Monday reveals Clinton staffers knew as early as 2011 that Anthony Weiner had been messaging an underage girl but chose to take no action.\nIn June of 2011, John Podesta, chair of Hillary Clinton＊s presidential campaign 每 received news of an investigation into Weiner＊s online contact with a 17-year-old Delaware high school student.\nThe email , sent by Jennifer Palmieri, the current Clinton campaign communications director, detailed lurid claims of private messages to an underage girl being investigated by police. Now it is only LOGICAL to say that if these people knew, Hillary Clinton knew as well.\nPodesta＊s reaction suggested he was undisturbed by the news. He replied to the email, ※Oof.§\nPalmieri＊s email also included snippets of a Fox News report at the time, saying police were investigating Weiner＊s communication with the girl.\n※Police on Friday afternoon came to the home of a 17-year-old high school junior to ask her about direct online communications she has had with Rep. Anthony Weiner,§ the Fox News article said.\nSources close to the 17-year-old at the time told Fox News that the girl and Weiner had direct-messaged each other on Twitter.\nThe girl openly expressed her feelings for the disgraced congressman, who followed her on Twitter. She also expressed her affinity for married men, according to Patterico.com .\nAt the time, Wiener was married to Huma Abedin, Clinton＊s confidante and vice chairwoman, who is now a centerpiece of a fresh FBI investigation into the handling of classified material while Clinton was in office.\nThe scandal was one of many committed by the former congressman, whose return to the public eye has infuriated Democrats .\nOn Sunday, FBI Director James Comey announced that the FBI was re-opening its investigation into Clinton＊s private email server, having discovered new emails that ※appear to be pertinent.§\nWeiner is at the center of the investigation, along with his estranged wife, Abedin. Law enforcement officials told The New York Times that the emails were uncovered after the FBI seized devices belonging to Abedin.\nComey has come under fire for his decision, but he has vigorously defended the integrity of the probe.\n※You can call us wrong, but don＊t call us weasels. We are not weasels,§ Comey said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in September. ※We are honest people, and whether or not you agree with the result, this was done the way you want it to be done.§\nClinton has demanded the FBI ※come clean§ with more specifics, and some Democrats have gone as far as to accuse Comey of interfering with the election and violating the Hatch Act .\n※We＊re not going to be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us,§ Clinton told a Florida rally.\nAbedin separated from Weiner in August after it emerged that he was exchanging lewd messages with a woman on social media. Such behavior had destroyed his congressional career and his 2013 mayoral campaign.\n\n\nSource",

    "text": "A chilling Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MoFA ) ※urgent action§ report issued to all Federation ministries within the past hour is warning that the United States is now suffering a complete breakdown in its normal governmental functions after the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) notified President Obama that all of Hillary Clinton＊s believed to be deleted and/or destroyed secret emails have now been completely recovered . [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\nAccording to a Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) addendum to this MoFA ※urgent action§ report, the FBI was able to recover all of Hillary Clinton＊s once secret emails from the computer shared by her campaign vice chairman Huma Abedin and sexual deviant husband Anthony Weiner〞 both of whom are now under the protection of the FBI as ※cooperating witnesses§ against Hillary Clinton.\nTo exactly how all of Hillary Clinton＊s secret emails and documents ended up on the Abedin-Weiner laptop computer, the SVR explains, was due to its use of the Outlook and IMAP email protocols that will sync any folder, on any device, they are told to monitor and can be told to make local copies of emails 〞which simply means that Abedin used the laptop computer she shared with her disgraced husband to back up every communication Hillary Clinton ever made〞and that numbered 650,000 copies of emails, documents and other communications .\nUnbeknownst, however, to both Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, and everyone else aiding their criminality, this report continues, is that when the US Congress ordered all of these secret emails turned over to them, Clinton, in turn, ordered them all destroyed 〞but with her, and those aiding her, failing to realize that when these emails were ※bleached§ (a computer program used to destroy hard drives) from her secret private server they did so with it offline, meaning that it wasn＊t able to ※backtrack§ to the Abedin-Weiner laptop to destroy all of the backups emails, documents and communications discovered by the FBI .\nThough the exact contents of these now discovered Hillary Clinton secret emails it is not fully ※known/understood§ by the SVR, this report notes, the FBI agents who have been documenting their contents have become so horrified by what they＊re discovering they are now reporting to the American press that Hillary Clinton is the ※antichrist personified§ .\nEven worse, this report continues, with new Wikileaks showing that not only is Hillary Clinton and her criminal money laundering organization, known as the Clinton Foundation, being investigated by the FBI, nearly every other US intelligence and tax agency have, likewise, begun investigations too .\nThus leading, this report gravely explains, to a complete breakdown in the rule of law in the United States as the main investigators into Hillary Clinton＊s crimes are all now known to be her supporters who have received tens-of-millions of dollars in ※gifts/bribes§ to protect her 〞and that led former CIA agent and American diplomat Dr. Steve Pieczenik to personally notify President Putin this past week that the US intelligence community has now launched a counter-coup against Hillary Clinton .\n\nThis report concludes by noting that not only did Dr. Pieczenik take the extraordinary ※measure/step§ of informing President Putin of this US intelligence community counter-coup, he also posted his warning to YouTube for all of the American people to see too〞but that in spite of its extraordinarily being viewed by over 2.5 million of these peoples in less than 24 hours , the Hillary Clinton supporting global tech giant Google has suppressed this fact from its main trends〞 giving the top place, instead, to a video mocking Americans that has only 1.6 million views , and that stunningly doesn＊t include Dr. Pieczenik＊s warning video at all .\nSource",

    "title": "Bernie Sanders was a Con Artist, had an 'Agreement' with Hillary Clinton - Wikileaks",
    "text": "According to a new Wikileaks email, Bernie Sanders was just a Manchurian candidate and a Clinton puppet all along. We finally have confirmation of what we have suspected since Bernie said ※people are sick of hearing about your damn emails§ all the way back in 2015 during one debate. That was a big give-away and a huge red flag which many have raised back then but now we finally have irrefutable proof that Bernie Sanders was just a SCAM candidate and a con artist.\nBernie＊s ONLY role was gather millennials plus the angry people on the left, the Democrats who feel disappointed with the Obama establishment which could later be passed over to Hillary Clinton. These people would have never came directly to Hillary Clinton in the first place so they needed an intermediary, like a vessel. Some eventually came to Hillary but not too many since it was discovered that the nomination was stolen from Bernie and he didn＊t protest at all.\nNow yet ANOTHER email by Robby Mook who is Hillary＊s campaign strategist and manager has come out thanks to Wikileaks where it appears that Hillary Clinton had ※leverage§ to use against Bernie Sanders in case he ever stepped over the line and that they had to ※signal§ him after he violated their ※agreement§.\nWikileaks Emails ID 47397 reveals the following disturbing information: \nThis isn＊t in keeping w the agreement . Since we clearly have some leverage , would be good to flag this for him. I could send a signal via Welch每or did you establish a direct line w him\nWe now have written confirmation that there was an agreement between Hillary Clinton and false revolutionary Bernie Sanders from the beginning. So now we know why Bernie isn＊t appalled by Hillary calling his supporters basement dwellers , bucket of losers and dumb millennials . Now we know why he continues to campaign with her despite being investigated by the FBI for child pornography, Satanic rituals and was even caught causing riots in places like Chicago with paid protesters dressed as Bernie Sanders supporters so they can get the blame.\nIf you are a former Bernie Sanders supporter who feels disappointed after this one, here＊s the reason why you should vote for Donald Trump and why we believe Trump is the real socialist you were all looking for.\nSo despite everything, he＊s still with her. Now we know why! I mean we always felt like we knew why but we didn＊t have any proof. Now we have the proof to back up our claims.",

    "text": "An absolutely stunning Ministry of Finance ( MoF ) report circulating in the Kremlin today is expressing ※outrage/anger§ against the US Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) for its leaking to the New York Post some of the details relating to the disappearance of $20 million from a private Hillary Clinton charity that Federation banking regulators have determined was a bribe used by her to pay President Obama so that she could become the American Secretary of State. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\nAccording to this report, the practice of President Obama selling American government positions was first raised in 2013 by US diplomats who publically cried foul over this massive bribery scheme 〞and that hacked emails and documents proved was widespread, including bribes to become everything form ambassadors to assistant attorneys in the Justice Department .\nTo the largest known bribe to President Obama for a US government position though, this report continues, MoF banking regulators discovered in a Citibank Kazakhstan numbered (secret) account originally holding $20 million linked to the American leader by transfers made from it to his ※personal/private§ JPMorgan Chase account .\nTo how this discovery was made, this report notes, was through a MoF banking examination of the Republic of Kazakhstan who is seeking to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( AIIB ) that the Federation is the third largest shareholder in after China and India .\nDuring the MoF＊s examination of the Kazakhstan banking system on behalf of the AIIB, this report explains, a ※mysterious/suspicious§ numbered (secret) account (that originally held $20 million) was discovered at Citibank Kazakhstan in the name of a private American entity (not a non-profit) called the Haiti Development Fund LLC that was created by the Clinton Foundation criminal money laundering organization and was solely funded by Canadian mining mogul Frank Giustra and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim with the money being ※channeled/funneled§ through the Clinton-Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada).\nFrank Giustra, this report explains, is one of Hillary Clinton＊s main supporters who, so far, has given her over $100 million as well allowing her to use of one of his private luxury jets , while Carlos Slim has, likewise, pledged to give her $100 million 〞and who just months prior to Clinton announcing her run for the US presidency, in 2015, became the majority owner of the New York Times that throughout this American election cycle has turned this once internationally respected newspaper into nothing more than a Donald Trump ※destruction machine§ with it even shockingly admitting ※ that because Trump says things that are rude, politically incorrect, or debatable, and ※conducting his campaign in ways we＊ve not normally seen,§ there is no need for news reporters to treat him to objective reporting §.\nWith the Carlos Slim＊s New York Times being the beginning of the ※ vast leftist echo chamber § created to defeat Donald Trump, this report says, its nearly all untrue articles about him are able to be parroted by hundreds of other news sites while at the same time ignoring the vast criminality of Hillary Clinton〞and that due to Wikileaks the Clinton campaign has been forced to admit, including Hillary Clinton illegally accepting millions in bribes from radical Islamic countries , and a staggering internal Clinton Foundation document admitting that it is not a charity, but a ※political operation§ that has broken the law .\nEqually as stunning to the self admitting facts that the Clinton Foundation is corrupt, this report continues, has been Carlos Slim＊s New York Times keeping from the American people the shocking truth relating to Hillary Clinton＊s campaign chairman John Podesta＊s pedophilia〞and as evidenced by his home being filled with paintings, photos and sculptures of naked teenager children, and that the Washington Post attempted to cover up , but whose original story about this abhorrent crime against children can still be viewed online .\nAnd as if Hillary Clinton＊s campaign chairman John Podesta＊s pedophilia isn＊t enough to shock normal human senses, this report says, Carlos Slim＊s New York Times covering up his fascination with human cannibalism is equally as concerning as new Wikileaks documents have revealed his satanic occult relationship with it is called ※Spirit Cooking§ whose sickening rituals include the use of blood, semen and breast milk .\nThough the MoF does note that the current war being waged by the FBI against Hillary Clinton ( and as we＊ve previously reported on ) is, indeed, justified , this report concludes, their leaking to the New York Post elements of a Federation investigation isn＊t〞and that led Prime Minister Medvedev earlier today to state that relations between Russia and the United States ※ have now hit rock bottom §.\nSource",

[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\nAccording to this report, MoD intelligence analysts became ※concerned/alarmed§ over a 25 October US military joint air defense exercise in the Arabian Sea that coordinated US Navy aircraft carrier defense of US Air Force transport and refueling aircraft〞but that further analysis revealed was but a precursor to a much larger planned American military ※event§ scheduled for 14 December as part of the Pentagon＊s planning for the upcoming inauguration of their next president.\nThe Pentagon＊s planning for their 14 December ※event§, this report continues, involves the Atlantic Ocean deployment between the United States and European Union of the aircraft carriers USS George H.W.

    "text": "a?Get ready for war with Russiaa? if Hillary Clinton is elected president, said progressive Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein.\na?This election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,a? Stein warned, explaining that Clintona?s trigger-happy militarism a?is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen.a?\nWhile Stein adamantly opposes a Trump presidency, she explained that the dangers posed by a Clinton presidency are a?arguably even more immediate and intense.a?\nStein blasted Clintona?s a?warmongeringa? that a?almost singlehandedlya? brought us the turmoil in Libya and could lead us into a nuclear war if Clinton were elected president.\na?Hillary brought us Libya almost singlehandedly,a? Stein explained in a Thursday Fox Business interview. She continued:\nAnd she has said that she will lead the charge with a no-fly zone in Syria, and that basically amounts to a declaration of war against Russia, who is there under international law, having been invited by the sitting government. Like it or not, Russia has the sanction of international law to be there. For us to go in and declare a no-fly zone means get ready for war with Russia. Both of us have 2,000 nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert. This is the most dangerous momenta§ according to the former president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, who, two weeks ago, said this is the most dangerous nuclear moment ever.\nStein elaborated on this view during a Facebook Live interview with progressive Marc Lamont Hill, who has endorsed Stein over Clinton: a?In this election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,a? Stein said, adding:\nNot only in regards to climate, not only in regards to these expanding wars where Hillary has this proven track record a? of the most pro-conflict military policy as possible, and shea?s calling for a no-fly zone in Syria, which means wea?re essentially declaring war on Russia if Hillary gets electeda※declaring war on Russia at a time when we have 2,000 nuclear weapons between us and the Russians on hair trigger alert. This is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen. So ita?s really important right now for us to stand up and start building a force to do the right thing.\na?No one should fool themselves into thinking that the dangers will be smaller, that they will be mitigated in any way for having Hillary in White House. In some ways, theya?re arguably even more immediate and intense,a? Stein said. a?But the dangers will be mitigated if we have created a strong force and we stand up loud and clear and we have a political base for this social movement that is coming together across this country and, really, across the worlda※this movement that puts people, planet, and peace over profit.a?\na?Ita?s very clear what kind of a trend wea?re on,a? Stein explained:\nThis is a race to the bottom between the greater and lesser evil. Where is the exit strategy if you buy into this [idea that one must vote for one of the major parties]? It means that in every election, we have two candidates that are more corporatist, more militarist, more imperialist, more economic elites, more serving Wall Street, offshoring our jobs, more of these rigged corporate trade agreements, more of this climate policy. a? There is no exit strategy if you buy into the lesser evil. It means with each race, we come closer and closer to the cliff.\na?We must find and elect alternatives to the Wall Street-backed oligarchy, the warmongers, and the anti-humanitarians,a? Stein wrote on Twitter.\nStein, who has previously described Clinton as a?Queen of corruption,a? attacked Clinton for her questionable ties to Qatar and Saudi Arabia:\nDuring her interview with Stein, Fox Business host Kennedy blasted other members of the mainstream media for ignoring and trying to a?smothera? Steina?s a?authentica? and a?interestinga? candidacy.\na?Ia?m surprised that the mainstream media has taken an interesting, authentic candidate like yourselfa§ they were so obsessed with Bernie Sandersa§ and youa?ve got someone, the embodiment of this new and interesting political tapestry, and theya?ve essentially ignored you and smothered your candidacy,a? Kennedy said.\nStein agreed and said that the corporate mediaa?s blackout of her campaign and their perpetuation a?speaks volumes.a? She said, a?My campaign is a very inconvenient truth that there is a politics of integrity out there. a? Every day, there are more revelations how both a? [Trump and Clinton] are walking, talking scandal machines, and people are clamoring for something else.a? She added, a?The corporate media, the apologists for the Democrats and Republicans, and the political pundits are doing everything they can to intimidate people into voting for the system thata?s throwing them under the bus.a?\nSource",

    "text": "DCG | 5 Comments \nConsidering that Timberlake supports Hillary, he may not be the brightest bulb. We should at least be grateful that he＊s not offering blowjobs to anyone voting for Hillary. \nFrom Daily Mail : Tennessee officials are investigating Justin Timberlake after the singer took a selfie in a voting booth. \nIn a photo posted to his Instagram account on Monday, the 35-year-old celebrity stands in front of a ballot machine and makes a scrunched up face. The caption reads: ＆Hey! You! Yeah, YOU! I just flew from LA to Memphis to #rockthevote !!! No excuses, my good people! There could be early voting in your town too. If not, November 8th! Choose to have a voice! If you don＊t, then we can＊t HEAR YOU! Get out and VOTE! #excerciseyourrighttovote.＊ \nTaking a photo or recording audio in a voting booth is a crime in Tennessee, with a penalty of up to 30 days in prison and a $50 fine. \nAfter the picture was posted on Monday, a representative from the Shelby County, Tennessee District Attorney＊s office told TMZ that Timberlake＊s actions are ＆under review＊. The Tennessee law banning ballot selfies was passed last year and so far no one has been prosecuted for violating it. \nAn official for the election board where Justin voted told TMZ that the hitmaker should be lauded for calling on his more than 31million followers to vote. \nTimberlake and his wife Jessica Biel hosted a $33,400-a-ticket fundraiser for Hillary Clinton last spring. \nLaws nationwide are mixed on whether voters are allowed to take pictures of themselves in the act or of their ballots 每＆ballot selfies＊. Federal judges have struck down bans on selfies in New Hampshire and Indiana, and rules have been changed in places like California and Rhode Island, but in many states it＊s still a violation that carries potential fines or jail terms. \nThere are laws against sharing any photo of your ballot in 18 states, while six other states bar photography in polling places but do allow photos of mail-in ballots. \nCritics say such regulations have not kept up with technology and are confusing for voters and election workers. Some states that ban ballot selfies or have moved to block them cite concerns the photos could harm the integrity of the voting process by encouraging vote-buying or coercion, though some acknowledge there＊s no evidence to support those fears. \nDCG",

    "title": "Comment on Dilbert cartoonist & hypnotist Scott Adams in 2015 predicted a Hillary health crisis by Free the TrumpRolled!",
    "text": "Posted on September 13, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 19 Comments \nScott Adams is creator of the Dilbert comic strip. According to his self-description, Adams is also a hypnotist of many years, trained in observing people and subtle nuances in appearance and body language. \nBelow is Adams＊ post of September 11, 2016, ※ Checking My Predictions About Clinton＊s Health ,§ which was republished by Russia Insider : \nIn a blog post I wrote on December 27th , 2015, I said this＃ \nBonus Thought 1: One of the skills a hypnotist has to master is reading people＊s inner thoughts based on their body language. That＊s a common skill for people in the business world too, but hypnotists go deeper than looking at crossed arms and furrowed brows. We learn to look for subtle changes in breathing patterns, tiny changes in muscle tone, variations in skin color (blushing or not), word choice, pupil dilation, and more. I assume law enforcement people look for similar tells when doing interrogations. \nAs regular readers know, I＊m a trained hypnotist. And to me, Hillary Clinton looks as if she is hiding a major health issue. If you read Malcolm Gladwell＊s book, Blink , you know that so-called ※experts§ can sometimes instantly make decisions before they know why . In my case, I am going to make an ※expert§ hypnotist prediction about Hillary Clinton without knowing exactly which clues I am picking up, or whether I am hallucinating them. \nPrediction: I＊ll put the odds at 75% that we learn of an important Clinton health issue before the general election. That estimate is based on my own track record of guessing things about people without the benefit of knowing why . I think Trump is picking up the same vibe. He has already questioned Clinton＊s ※stamina.§ \nOn December 29th, 2015 I blogged that Trump would be seen as ※running unopposed§ before election day. I mentioned Clinton＊s health as a possible reason. \nWhile I＊m on the topic, I＊ll add another prediction to the Master Persuader series. I predict that by the time Trump is in the general election and running against Clinton, you will start hearing that Trump ( Lucky Hitler) is 每 for all practical purposes 每 ※running unopposed§ as Clinton＊s poll numbers plummet. \nThat can happen in a variety of ways. One way is if Clinton＊s health or legal issues rise to the point of being disqualifying, and Trump persuades us to think about those things more than we think about anything else. Once you imagine there is one candidate in the race who is eligible and one who might not survive the term, or might be in jail, you start to imagine it as a one-person race. \nAnd you will. That＊s how you get a landslide. \nLook for the words ※running unopposed§ in pundit articles and quotes within a few months of election day. And it still counts if it started here, because it won＊t catch on unless it actually fits. \nOn April 29th of 2016 I expanded on the thought in this post . \nI have blogged and tweeted that Hillary Clinton looks unhealthy to me. And I have mentioned on Twitter that one of the skills of a hypnotist is identifying subtle bodily changes. Observation is a huge part of a hypnotist＊s skill. You look for micro changes in muscle tone, breathing, posture, and anything else that can tell you whether your technique is working or you need to quickly pivot to a new approach. Think of it as rapid A-B testing on humans. And like any skill, one gets better with practice. I have more than three decades of practice for this specific skill. \nWhat I see in Clinton＊s health is an unusual level of variability. Sometimes her eyes bug out, sometimes they are tired and baggy. Sometimes she looks puffy, sometimes not. It would be easy to assume fatigue is the important variable. And that is clearly a big factor. But notice that the other candidates have little variability in their physicality. Trump always looks like Trump. Cruz always looks like Cruz, and so on. Sometimes we think we can detect fatigue in their answers, but visually the other candidates appear about the same every day. \nClinton, on the other hand, looks   That suggests some greater variability in her health. And that＊s probably a tell for medications that are waxing and waning but rarely at the ideal levels. Or perhaps the underlying conditions have normal variability. Or both. \nUnder normal circumstances it would be deeply irresponsible for a cartoonist to give a medical diagnosis to a stranger he hasn＊t met. I trust you to ignore my medical opinions. I do this to build a record of my persuasion-related predictions and to show you the method. \nI give Clinton a 50% chance of making it to November with sufficiently good health to be considered a viable president. Judging from her performance on the campaign trail, she is managing her health effectively to get the job done. But I would think most people who run for president end up sacrificing their health in some measure. The big question is how much buffer she has left. \nTo be clear, there is no dependable evidence of Clinton having an undisclosed major health issue. But it looks that way to observers. \n~End of Scott Adams＊ article~ \nH/t FOTM＊s josephbc69",

    "text": "Posted on October 28, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 3 Comments \nFour days ago, on October 24, 2016, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford sent a fascinating piece of communication, titled ※ Upholding Our Oath ,§ to every member of the U.S. Armed Services. \nNote: General Joseph Dunford Jr. , 60, was the 36th Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. Nominated by Obama, Dunford became the 19th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on October 1, 2015. \nThis is what Gen. Dunford wrote : \n※As the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff＃as our country again prepares for a peaceful transfer of power to a new administration, I write to share my views regarding our mutual obligations as military professionals and rights as citizens during this election season. \nEvery service member swears ※to support and defend the Constitution of the United States§ and to ※bear true faith and allegiance to the same.§ This oath is embedded in our professional culture and underpins the values that shape and define our all-volunteer force. Beginning with General George Washington resigning his military commission, our deliberate and disciplined commitment to upholding the principle of civilian control of the military underpins not only our warrior ethos but also the expectations of how we conduct ourselves while in uniform. \nWhile we must always safeguard our professional integrity, extra vigilance is required during any political transition. Our individual and collective obligation during this election season is twofold. First, we must recognize that we have one Commander in Chief, and until authority is transferred on January 20, 2017, the Joint Force must remain clearly focused on and responsive to the existing National Command Authority. Second, the Joint Force must conduct itself in such a way that the new administration has confidence that it will be served by a professional, competent, and apolitical military. This is especially important in the context of delivering the best military advice. \nEvery member of the Joint Force has the right to exercise his or her civic duty, including learning and discussing?〞?even debating?〞?the policy issues driving the election cycle and voting for his or her candidate of choice. Provided that we follow the guidance and regulations governing individual political participation, we should be proud of our civic engagement. What we must collectively guard against is allowing our institution to become politicized , or even perceived as being politicized, by how we conduct ourselves during engagements with the media, the public, or in open or social forums. \nWe are living in the most volatile and complex security environment since World War II. Whether confronting violent extremist organizations seeking to destroy our way of life or dealing with state actors threatening international order, threats to our national security require a Joint Force that is ready, capable, and trusted. To that end, I have a duty to protect the integrity and political neutrality of our military profession. But this obligation is not mine alone. It belongs to every Soldier, Marine, Sailor, Airman, and Coastguardsman. Thank you for joining me in honoring our history, our traditions, and the institutions of the U.S. Armed Forces by upholding the principle of political neutrality .§ \nEven without reading between the lines, General Dunford clearly has concerns about politicization of the military and its obligation and commitment to political neutrality and noninterference in politics. That the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff must remind members of the Armed Forces that they must ※uphold§ their oath both suggests and implies that the opposite is going on, i.e., the military is politicized and there are fears that it will intervene in civilian politics. \nIf this pic (below) of a young U.S. Marine is any indication, Gen. Dunford has good reasons to issue the ※Upholding Our Oath§ communication. \nA year ago, a Rasmussen Reports national survey of active and retired military personnel found that only 15% had a favorable opinion of Hillary Clinton, with just 3% who viewed her very favorably. A staggering 81% had an unfavorable opinion of her , including 69% who had a very unfavorable view of her. \nA similar survey today is sure to find even higher unfavorable ratings for Hillary among those whom she would command as their Commander in Chief. \nH/t GiGi and TruthFeedNews",

    "text": "Dr. Eowyn | 8 Comments \nFriday is usually the day when controversial and incendiary news is dumped because the people doing the dumping are counting on Americans not paying due attention, preoccupied as they are with their plans for the weekend. \nYesterday, October 28, 2016, 11 days before Election Day , came news that FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to congressional leaders and relevant committee chairmen that in the course of investigating ※an unrelated case,§ the FBI found new emails that ※appear to be pertinent§ to the FBI＊s case on then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton＊s unsecured private email server. As a result, the FBI is reopening its investigation of Hillary. \nThe FBI began their investigation of Hillary in July, 2015. A year later, Comey announced that the FBI was not recommending charges against Hillary, saying ※no reasonable prosecutor§ would bring such a case. But he did chastise the former secretary of state for being ※extremely careless§ in her handling of sensitive information. For her part, Hillary continues to insist lie that her decision to use a private email server was merely a ※mistake,§ that the emails contained no classified information, and that she violated no laws. \nAddressed to the respective Chairpersons of Congressional Committees on Intelligence, Judiciary, Appropriations, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Oversight and Government Reform, below is Comey＊s brief letter of October 28, 2016 : \nU.S. Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation Washington, D. C. 20535 \nOctober 28, 2016 \nDear Messrs Chairmen: \nIn previous congressional testimony, l referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton＊s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony. \nIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. \nAlthough the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant , and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work , I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony. \nSincerely yours, James B. Comey Director \nThe ※unrelated case§ is the FBI＊s investigation of illicit text messages (sextexts) sent to a 15-year-old female minor in North Carolina by Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former Congressman (D-NY) and estranged husband of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Note: Even after losing his Congressional seat after news broke of his sextexts and sending a picture of his erection to a woman, Weiner has continued with his sextexts. The most recent scandal was his sending , to a busty 40-something divorcee in California, a picture of himself with an erection, in bed next to his infant child ( New York Post ). \nAs part of the probe, the FBI seized devices from Weiner, including a laptop computer shared by Weiner and Abedin. The laptop＊s hard drive reportedly contained thousands of Abedin＊s emails to Hillary and other State Department officials. \nExperts believe that since Comey＊s letter was sent just 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, the FBI must have found something significant despite Comey＊s assertion otherwise. \nVictoria Toensing, a former deputy assistant attorney general of the U.S. and a former assistant U.S. attorney, suspects agents came directly to Comey with evidence he could not ignore. Toensing said: ※Well, it couldn＊t be a trifling thing, because this is a big deal. You can see the brouhaha this is causing, so it couldn＊t just be a little incident over email. It has to be pretty significant.§ \nToensing and her husband, former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova, have publicly discussed the number of career FBI and Justice Department employees who are disgusted that Hillary was not prosecuted for her ※careless§ handling of classified information and that Comey refused even to recommend charges. She believes Comey may have acted Friday with that internal criticism in mind: ※I think he＊s felt the heat. If nobody had criticized him at all he might have made this go under the rug. He knows he＊s in a glass house.§ \nPredictably, the news that it was Anthony Weiner＊s sexual indiscretions that led the FBI to re-open its investigation of Hillary mere days before the presidential election, resulted in a flurry of jokes, puns and innuendos, such as ※Cocktober Surprise§. But the best line is from ZeroHedge reader Omega_Man: \nBREAKING: DNC-Clinton campaign, along with Donna Brazile, have stated that the young girl Weiner was flirting with was actually Vladimir Putin in disguise. \nHow ironic that the political ambitions of Hillary 〞 the woman who means to be America＊s first female president 〞 may be scuttled by two dicks. Already neck-deep in the ever-increasing number of women who accuse Bill Clinton of sexual harassment, rape, and fathering a child out of wedlock, Hillary now finds herself re-enmeshed in FBI investigation as a result of Anthony Weiner＊s sexual exploits. \nIt＊s self-proclaimed feminist Hillary＊s karmic payback for not just turning a blind eye to her husband＊s decades of abusing women, but scapegoating and blaming his victims as sluts and floozies.",

    "text": "DCG | 2 Comments \nRules are for little people. \nFrom Daily Mail : Hillary Clinton did not disclose ＆expensive gifts,＊ free vacations, and complimentary private jet travel her family received from business interests while she was at the State Department, according to leaked emails and federal disclosure records reviewed by the DailyMail.com. \nLong-time Clinton aide Doug Band claimed in a confidential 2011 memo published by Wikileaks this week that he helped obtain free vacations and personal travel for Bill Clinton and his family as part of his duties. \nDuring Hillary Clinton＊s tenure at the State Department, she did not report any gifts or travel reimbursements for herself or her spouse in her financial disclosure filings. \n＆In support of the President＊s for-profit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the President and his family 每 for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like,＊ wrote Band in the Nov. 16, 2011 memo to attorneys conducting an internal review of the Clinton Foundation. \nHe added that his job involved ＆supporting [Bill Clinton＊s] family/personal needs (e.g., securing in-kind private airplane travel, in-kind vacation stays, and supporting family business and personal needs).＊ \nThe memo did not say whether Hillary Clinton was one of Bill Clinton＊s family members who received vacations, gifts, or personal travel. Band did not respond to request for comment. \nIn November 2011, according to the memo, the telecommunications company Ericsson agreed to give Bill Clinton $400,000 in private plane travel. The company also paid the former president an additional $750,000 to speak at its conference that month in Hong Kong. \nIt was the largest speaking fee Bill Clinton had received up until that point, and with the added plane fare, the payment reached well over $1 million. \nAlthough Hillary Clinton reported in her disclosure filings that her husband received a $750,000 honorarium for the speech, she did not disclose the additional $400,000 in private plane expenses from Ericsson in the spousal income or gifts and reimbursements sections . \nIn another Nov. 17, 2011 email, Band complained that Bill Clinton was not required to submit an internal conflict-of-interest disclosure form 每 unlike other top officials at the Clinton Global Initiative 每 despite the fact that the former president received ＆expensive gifts＊ for his home from CGI sponsors . Bill Clinton and Doug Band \nBill Clinton ＆does not have to sign such a document even though he is personally paid by 3 CGI sponsors, gets many expensive gifts from them, some that are at home etc,＊ wrote Band. \nHillary Clinton did not disclose any gift or travel expenses that she or her husband received while at the State Department. The federal disclosure form requires officials to report gifts to themselves or a spouse totalling more than $350 from a single source, such as ＆tangible items, transportation, lodging, food, or entertainment＊ and ＆travel-related cash reimbursements.＊ \nHowever, a federal official does not have to disclose gifts to a spouse that are ＆totally independent of their relationship＊ 每 for example, business-related benefits that a spouse receives from his employer. While many of the companies involved in CGI and Bill Clinton＊s for-profit business had interests before the State Department, government ethics experts said it can be difficult to determine whether a gift to a public official＊s spouse is connected to their relationship . \nIt is also unclear whether Hillary Clinton travelled on any of these ＆personal trips＊ and ＆in-kind vacations,＊ which Band wrote were given to Bill Clinton＊s ＆family.＊ The Clintons have a 36-year-old daughter, Chelsea, who is also involved in the Clinton Foundation. \nA spokesperson for Clinton＊s campaign did not respond to request for comment. \nAccording to the National Legal and Policy Center, a government watchdog group, failure to report certain gifts in a financial disclosure form could violate the Ethics in Government Act or the Federal False Statements Act. \nFederal laws ＆require full disclosure of such expensive gifts and reimbursements when special interests use a spouse to target a government official,＊ said Ken Boehm, chairman of the NLPC. \n＆The just-disclosed emails of Clinton associate Doug Band that Bill Clinton and his family members benefitted from hundreds of thousands of dollars in free travel and gifts from special interests while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State raises substantial ethical and legal issues because the Financial Disclosure reports filed by Secretary Clinton does not show these expensive gifts and reimbursements,＊ said Boehm. \nDCG",

    "text": "The American Medical Association defines an ※alcoholic§ as someone who: Has a prolonged period of frequent, heavy alcohol use. Is unable to control drinking once it has begun. Has withdrawal symptoms when the individual stops using alcohol. Needs to use more and more alcohol to achieve the same effects. Has a variety of social and/or legal problems arising from alcohol use. \nBy that definition, Hillary Clinton is an alcoholic. Exhibit A \nIn an email to Hillary＊s campaign chairman John Podesta on August 8, 2015, Director of Communications for Hillary＊s campaign Jennifer Palmieri wrote, referring to Hillary: \n※I think you should call her and sober her up some.§ \nHere＊s a screenshot of the email released by WikiLeaks : Exhibit B \nOn Feb. 23, 2015, Hillary＊s spokesman Nick Merrill sent an email (presumably to Hillary＊s campaign staff) with the subject: ※HRC Clips§ (news clips on Hillary Rodham Clinton). The news clips that day included an article by Benjamin Bell for ABC News titled, ※One Thing That Might Surprise You About Hillary Clinton,§ which Merrill reproduced in its entirety in his email. \nBell＊s article was an interview with New York Times national political reporter Amy Chozick, on whether Hillary Clinton would announce she＊s running for the presidency. One of the questions Bell asked Chozick was: ※Covering [Hillary] Clinton, what is one thing that has surprised you about her?§ \nChozick answered: \n※Hmm. She likes to drink. We were on the campaign trail in 2008 and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in Pennsylvania. Um, no.§ \nHere＊s a composite screenshot of the relevant part of Merrill＊s email, from WikiLeaks : Exhibit C \nAccording to the National Enquirer , ※top staffers§ of Hillary＊s campaign told the Enquirer ※they even began this year＊s presidential campaign by secretly planning a stint in rehab for Hillary.§ But any rehab therapy ※quickly failed amid the pressures of the campaign§ and ※the effort of making a deal over an FBI probe into her e-mail scandal§. \nA source said, ※The stress of her political career, the never-ending scandals and her worsening health plunged her into a life-threatening booze hell. She turned to drink to drown her fears. Hillary tries to hide her problem, like she lies about so many things.§ A ※close friend§ of Hillary added, ※ Hillary has been drinking heavily for years to forget her miserable marriage to serial cheater Bill. She＊s also hit the bottle to cope with other stress, as well as the boredom of flying all over the world when she was Secretary of State.§ \nOne ※Hillary insider§ told the Enquirer that Hillary ※has blackouts and wakes up wondering where she is and what she has done § and that ※She＊s not fit to be President§. \nCertainly, Hillary must be drunk when she obscenely ground against the twerking black woman (see below) because no sane person in her then position as U.S. Secretary of State would behave like this in public. \n~Eowyn",

    "text": "We＊ve all heard of or read about the many people who, it is said, were murdered on orders of Bill and Hillary Clinton. (See, for example, the website Arkancide .) \nBut the deaths are the stuff of rumors 〞 until now. \nOn September 24, 2013, on the Pete Santilli radio show, a former longtime Clinton associate named Larry Nichols admitted that he had killed people as the Clintons＊ hit man or murderer-for-hire. I took this screenshot of Larry Nichols from one of his videos uploaded to YouTube in 2009. \nLarry Nichols (LN), a self-described former Green Beret, was a longtime associate of Bill Clinton (BC) and served as the marketing director of BC＊s Arkansas Development Finance Authority (ADFA), ※the best kept secret in Arkansas.§ The two men first met in the late 1970s when BC was an up-and-coming politician. Wikipedia has no entry on Arkansas Development Finance Authority except for a brief reference to ADFA as one of the entities investigated by the United States Senate Whitewater Committee , but without identifying or describing what ADFA is. So I did an Internet search for ADFA and discovered that it is actually an agency of the Arkansas State government. The ADFA website describes itself as ※ Arkansas＊ largest source of low-cost financing for low-to-moderate income housing development, small industries, government, education, agricultural business enterprise & health care.§ \nOn September 24, 2013, Nichols was interviewed by the Pete Santilli radio show for GuerillaMediaNetwork.com. As introduced by Santilli, Nichols ※has a lot of inside information on the Clinton crime family.§ He published The Clinton Chronicles (a 1990 documentary subtitled ※An Investigation Into the Alleged Criminal Activities of Bill Clinton§) on the Clintons＊※child trafficking,§ Bill＊s ※sexual escapades,§ and how Hillary ※spent 30 years covering up Bill Clinton＊s sexual and criminal activities.§ \nHere＊s the audio of Nichols＊ interview with Santilli: \nLarry Nichols＊ interview begins at the 1:11:08 mark in the YouTube audio. Here＊s my transcription of what Nichols said. LN is Larry Nichols; PS is Pete Santilli. \nLN: ※I have actually beat up women and beat up husbands to protect the Clintons＃. Not only have I killed people for [Bill Clinton], I＊ve [never been in] jail.§ \nPS: ※You＊ve always been protected by the Clintons.§ \nBeginning at the 1:11:49 mark, LN says: ※But now let＊s call a spade a spade. I＊ve been all over the world killing people for this country, some deservedly, some not. Ain＊t matter to me. Just what I was paid to do＃. Ronald Reagan sent me to El Salvadore. I did it for God and country.§ \nPS asks if, at the time when LN killed for the Clintons, did he do it patriotically, for the common good? \nLN: ※I didn＊t give a shit. Some of these people, like Wayne Damond (?), needed to be dealt with. So I went to the jail, cut his nuts off, put them in a jar, put formaldehyde in it and left it there.§ \nPS asks what motivated LN in killing for the Clintons. \nLN: ※Just money. One minute I was doing something for the government, next minute I was doing something for the Clintons. What difference was it?§ \nPS asks how the Clintons presented ※these [murderous] tasks§ to LN. \nLN: ※Whenever I got an F2 call, that meant go and kill. State police are not trained to kill in ＃ the late ＊70s, early ＊80s. There were no SWAT teams＃. I had an F2 call, that meant go in and kill a guy. I didn＊t give a shit＃. When it [the order to kill] came from the president [Reagan], it was for God and country. When it came from Clinton, hell, I didn＊t give a damn. I just go kill somebody, cut his nuts off.§ \nPS asks if LN was paid to murder. \nLN answers that if the Clintons did not pay him, ※they＊d piss me off and they didn＊t want to piss me off.§ \nAt some point, however, the Clintons turned on LN and he had to defend himself. LN says: ※I had to [defend myself] because I didn＊t have a support group. The media weren＊t going to cover it, so if I died, they＊d just pour alcohol over me and say I was drunk and crashed on the side of the road.§ \nPS asks LN what kept him alive. \nLN: ※I＊m a Green Beret. I＊m trained ＃ I＊m skilled in staying alive. We have one rule: Kill back first. So if they send people to me, I＊ll just kill them back first. I don＊t ask questions. I deal with it.§ \nLarry Nichols was also asked about Hillary Clinton＊s fitness to be president. His answer: ※After the Benghazi debacle, No.§ \nNichols claims that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a friend, told him what we already now know 〞 that the Obama administration had been providing arms for Muslim terrorists in Syria (via Libya). When Netanyahu voiced his objection, the arms supply stopped, which enraged the al-Qaeda-connected terrorists to attack the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. \nWhat Nichols doesn＊t say (doesn＊t know) is that the Obama regime has NOT stopped supplying arms to the Syrian ※rebels,§ but is actually expanding the CIA＊s training of the terrorists . \nH/t Dean Garrison and FOTM＊s TnRick \nSee also:",

    "title": "Comment on Chicago Tribune: Hillary Clinton should drop her campaign to be POTUS by stevor",
    "text": "Posted on October 30, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 12 Comments \nOn Friday, FBI Director James Comey informed Congress that the agency is re-opening its criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton＊s unsecured and illegal private email server, as a result of the FBI discovering 650,000 emails of Hillary＊s closest aide, Huma Abedin, on a laptop computer that Abedin shares with her now-estranged husband, the disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner. See ※ Weinered: FBI re-opens investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s emails ※ \nExperts, such as Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein, say that only the discovery of something truly awful would lead the FBI to reopen its investigation at such a late date, with just days to go before the election. \nNow, a major U.S. newspaper 〞 the Chicago Tribune that endorsed libertarian candidate Gary Johnson for president 〞 is saying what needs to be said: Democrats should ask Hillary Clinton to step down, or risk her being elected President who begins her term of office facing a criminal investigation. Note: Founded in 1847, Chicago Tribune is the 8th largest newspaper, by circulation, in the United States. \nBelow is Chicago Tribune reporter John Kass＊ stunning article in its entirety. \nDemocrats should ask Clinton to step aside \nby John Kass ? October 29, 2016 \nHas America become so numb by the decades of lies and cynicism oozing from Clinton Inc. that it could elect Hillary Clinton as president, even after Friday＊s FB I announcement that it had reopened an investigation of her emails while secretary of state? \nWe＊ll find out soon enough. \nIt＊s obvious the American political system is breaking down. It＊s been crumbling for some time now , and the establishment elite know it and they＊re properly frightened. Donald Trump, the vulgarian at their gates, is a symptom, not a cause. Hillary Clinton and husband Bill are both cause and effect. \nFBI director James Comey＊s announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign. That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious. \nThis can＊t be about pervert Anthony Weiner and his reported desire for a teenage girl. But it can be about the laptop of Weiner＊s wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin, and emails between her and Hillary. It comes after the FBI investigation in which Comey concluded Clinton had lied and been ※reckless§ with national secrets, but said he could not recommend prosecution. \nSo what should the Democrats do now? \nIf ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: \nThey would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately , and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. \nDemocrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. \nSince Oct. 7, WikiLeaks has released 35,000 emails hacked from Clinton campaign boss John Podesta release another 15,000 emails. \nWhat if she is elected? Think of a nation suffering a bad economy and continuing chaos in the Middle East, and now also facing a criminal investigation of a president. Add to that congressional investigations and a public vision of Clinton as a Nixonian figure wandering the halls, wringing her hands. \nThe best thing would be for Democrats to ask her to step down now . It would be the most responsible thing to do, if the nation were more important to them than power. And the American news media 〞 fairly or not firmly identified in the public mind as Mrs. Clinton＊s political action committee 〞 should begin demanding it. \nBut what will Hillary do? \nShe＊ll stick and ride this out and turn her anger toward Comey. For Hillary and Bill Clinton, it has always been about power, about the Clinton Restoration and protecting fortunes already made by selling nothing but political influence. \nShe＊ll remind the nation that she＊s a woman and that Donald Trump said terrible things about women. If there is another notorious Trump video to be leaked, the Clintons should probably leak it now. Then her allies in media can talk about misogyny and sexual politics and the headlines can be all about Trump as the boor he is and Hillary as champion of female victims, which she has never been . \nRemember that Bill Clinton leveraged the ※Year of the Woman.§ Then he preyed on women in the White House and Hillary protected him. But the political left 〞 most particularly the women of the left 〞 defended him because he promised to protect abortion rights and their other agendas. \nIf you take a step back from tribal politics, you＊ll see that Mrs. Clinton has clearly disqualified herself from ever coming near classified information again. If she were a young person straight out of grad school hoping to land a government job, Hillary Clinton would be laughed out of Washington with her record. She＊d never be hired. \nAs secretary of state she kept classified documents on the home-brew server in her basement, which is against the law. She lied about it to the American people. She couldn＊t remember details dozens of times when questioned by the FBI. Her aides destroyed evidence by BleachBit and hammers. Her husband, Bill, met secretly on an airport tarmac with Attorney General Loretta Lynch for about a half-hour, and all they said they talked about was golf and the grandkids. \nAnd there was no prosecution of Hillary. \nThat isn＊t merely wrong and unethical. It is poisonous. \nAnd during this presidential campaign, Americans were confronted with a two-tiered system of federal justice: one for standards for the Clintons and one for the peasants. \nI＊ve always figured that, as secretary of state, Clinton kept her home-brew email server 〞 from which foreign intelligence agencies could hack top secret information 〞 so she could shield the influence peddling that helped make the Clintons several fortunes. \nThe Clintons weren＊t skilled merchants. They weren＊t traders or manufacturers. The Clintons never produced anything tangible. They had no science, patents or devices to make them millions upon millions of dollars. \nAll they had to sell, really, was influence. And they used our federal government to leverage it. \nIf a presidential election is as much about the people as it is about the candidates, then we＊ll learn plenty about ourselves in the coming days, won＊t we? \nJohn Kass concluded his article with the observation that a presidential election is as much about the people as it is about the candidates . \nSo what do the comments from some of the readers of Kass＊ article say about the people and this country? Below is a sample: \nMerryPrankster: Real journalists should ask John Kass to step aside. \nmillekj61: Do you actually ※think§ before you write? There are 9 days to go before the election, who do you suggest they substitute for her? \npagewerks: Did you even do the slightest research? The email ※scandal§ you＊re panting over is non-existent, and apparently has to do with another investigation. But don＊t let that stop you from making a damn fool of yourself. \nMChicago99: What is unfathomable about this column and the comments is how disconnected from reality and truth it and the comments are. There has been no reopening of the investigation. THE emails in question are probably all duplicates of emails the FBI has already examined. The FBI did not find anything illegal in Clinton＊s use of the personal server. Just a desperate ploy to throw last minute obstacles into the election process. \nWavo: I believe it is time for you to retire from your ※establishment§ job at the Tribune John. Your shtick is tiresome and inflammatory. Maybe you should consider a second act over at Breitbart＃they and their readers seem to love your work. \nlarry_wesbsite: You Trumpites actually want national socialism under a national socialist leader who will ride roughshod over the Constitution seeking what you think are simple fast answers to complex, difficult questions and problems. Maybe you will learn or just blame Trump and move on to the next demagogue. All of us will pay the cost for your mistakes. \ndsm606: Sorry angry old white man. I＊m still not voting for Trump. Nice try, though. \nJim Kaestner: I am tired of tribune columnists telling me how to vote, who to support. Go tell Trump to quit, he has admitted to sexual assault. \nbluedemondan: Excuse me, you sure this isn＊t The Onion? I usually confuse The Onion with the Trib＊s editorials. \nJNAlbukerk: Kass have you no shame sir? Convicting someone with no evidence? Clinton is the most vetted and experienced candidate in history. Until you have evidence otherwise it is you who should step aside as you have abused the power your employment has granted you. \nYou can reach reporter John Kass by email () or by Twitter (Twitter@John_Kass). \n~Eowyn",

    "text": "Posted on October 31, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 5 Comments \nLast Saturday, Oct. 29, the Medford Police Patrolmen＊s Association (MPPA) of Medford, Massachusetts, posted 3 photos on its Facebook page of two Medford police officers seemingly arresting a person in a Hillary Clinton mask and orange prison clothes at the Halloween Fall Festival in Haines Square, West Medford. \nCBS Boston reports, Oct. 30, 2016, that the caption on the photos read: \n※Look who MPD grabbed at the Fall Festival in Haines Square today＃§ \nAnother photo showed three Medford police officers posing with someone in a Donald Trump mask, with the caption, ※Making America GREAT again in West Medford Square!!§ \nBy 8:15 pm that night, MPPA removed the posts from its Facebook page, with an apology in a statement from MPPA President Harry MacGilvray: \n※These were Halloween costumes. It was meant totally as a joke. I apologize if this offended anyone in any way. I never expected this sort of reaction. It was poor judgment on my part.§ \nMacGilvray was one of the officers in the photos. LOL \nFox25 WFXT reports that the police union removed the photos because of a flurry of negative Facebook comments from Hillary supporters, such as: \nJennifer Popkin: ※I can＊t believe this unprofessional behavior. Police in uniform should not be espousing political beliefs, let alone the kind of irresponsible rhetoric coming from Donald Trump. Absolutely deplorable and also likely illegal under Section 23(b)(2)(ii) of the conflict of interest law.§ \nMike Piehl: ※Trump goes on trial for fraud in November and child rape in December but YOU . . . .§ \nJeremy Thorpe: ※This is illegal. I am screen-shotting this comment to demonstrate that you are deleting critical comments.§ \nKatarina Dutton: ※As a citizen of Medford, I am appalled by police making it clear that I, and so many others, are not welcome or safe here.§ \nTamar Amidon: ※This is so shameful for Medford. I＊m so glad I don＊t live there now. I never thought of them being one of the bad apple bins.§ \nThat Popkin, Piehl, Thorpe, Dutton, Amidon, et al. are outraged by the Medford police Halloween prank but not in the least bothered by of Hillary Clinton＊s criminal use of an unsecured email server, her utterly corrupt pay-for-play Clinton Foundation, and her abandoning four Americans to die in Benghazi, can only mean one thing: \n~Eowyn",

Ronald Reagan was the last Republican that loved his country, he too almost died because of it, the Shadow Government that controls this world I call Satan＊s Elite forces, they are in the process of setting up a world government by using Madmen from the Middle East to create Chaos. As a Christian I believe what the Prophet Daniel was told and that is the dark forces of Satan can get control of man＊s governments, this world government will come about, the good news it will be destroyed along with the evil people who created it. Interestingly one of the names of that man we call the Antichrist [The Scriptures do Not] can be translated as ※The Man of Chaos§",

    "text": "Posted on November 3, 2016 by DCG | 6 Comments \nTruth hurts. \nFrom Washington Post : Authorities are investigating apparent tampering with an electronic road sign at a busy Virginia commuter lot that resulted in a disparaging remark about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and a call for people to ※Vote Trump.§ \nThe sign at the Tackett＊s Mill commuter lot in Lake Ridge flashed three consecutive message screens: ※CROOKED -HILARY§; followed by a profanity (※IS A B 每每每每 §); followed by ※VOTE TRUMP.§ \nThe messages were on display for an unknown period Tuesday evening while commuters headed to their homes in the Virginia suburb, about 25 miles southeast of the District. \nTheir tone reflects the bitter 2016 presidential race, in which both major-party candidates are historically unpopular and Trump＊s supporters openly wear T-shirts calling Clinton the b-word and gleefully chant ※Lock her up§ during his rallies. \n※Crooked Hillary§ is a name Trump coined for Clinton and uses regularly. Earlier this week, a tweet from the account of Texas＊s agriculture commissioner , a Trump adviser, took the name-calling a step further, using a vulgar term for female genitalia to refer to Clinton. \nIn Prince William County, the offending electronic sign was one that had been placed in the commuter lot about a month ago by the county elections office. It was programmed to broadcast a message encouraging early voting for those who cannot make it to the polls on Tuesday. \nThere are about 10 such signs posted in heavily trafficked areas across Prince William County, a relative Republican stronghold in the Washington area. The Board of County Supervisors is chaired by Corey Stewart (R), a high-profile cheerleader for Trump who co-chaired the GOP nominee＊s Virginia campaign until a dispute last month led to his ouster . \nElection officials in the county, which also has a fast-growing Latino population, are taking special measures this year to speed voting and minimize potential disruptions at the polls. \nOn Wednesday, officials said the tampered-with sign equipment had not been locked, giving whoever changed the message easy access to a keyboard panel inside. ※There＊s a set of instructions next to the panel,§ said Winston Forrest, a spokesman for the county elections office. ※Anyone who could get access to it could make the change.§ \nAfter the errant message was reported, it was turned off and the equipment was removed, according the county police. \nCounty elections officials said they have placed locks on the remaining voting road signs in the county. ※There are no more of these types of messages,§ Forrest said. \nRead the rest of the story here . \nDCG",

    "title": "Comment on Predetermined vote counts show Nov. 8 presidential election is rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton by Anonymous",
    "text": "Dr. Eowyn | 2 Comments WARNING: \nThis post may be the most important post you＊ll read on not just the 2016 election, but the entire electoral system that legitimates the U.S. republic of representative democracy. The post is long, with multiple sections, so pace yourself accordingly. I suggest you bookmark this webpage so that you can return to read or re-read. ? \nJim Stone first posted about this two days ago on Nov. 1, 2016. \nUnsure about Stone, who calls himself an ※independent journalist§ (based in Japan) and who writes in a less-than-clear or reader-friendly manner, I refrained from writing about his post. \nThen InfoWars picked this issue up a day later on November 2. \nWhat is claimed is that a hidden web site of NBC affiliate WRCBtv in Chattanooga, Tenn., shows pre-determined final vote counts for an election that hasn＊t yet occurred 〞 the 2016 presidential election scheduled for November 8. \nBelow is a screenshot Jim Stone took of the election results on WRCBtv＊s hidden webpage, showing Hillary Clinton winning with 343 electoral votes and 42% of the popular vote . As Stone puts it: ※SCAM ELECTION ALREADY CONFIRMED. TRUMP LOSES.§ \nStone and InfoWars say the predetermined election results are provided by Worldnow.com. \nSo what is WorldNow? \nThis is what Wikipedia says, with a lot of jargon: \n※WorldNow is a New York-based software company . . . [that] offers the only integrated media platform enabling broadcasters, operators and media companies to easily create, acquire, manage, analyze, monetize and distribute media assets (text, images and videos) across all digital platforms and on-air systems in a unified, end-to-end workflow . . . . Worldnow＊s customers include CBS, COX, Dispatch, Fox Television, Meredith Corporation, Media General and Raycom Media . . . . On July 29, 2015, WorldNow announced its sale to Frankly, a San Francisco-based provider of white label social media services and mobile messaging apps . . . . In 2012, Fox Television Stations migrated its websites to WorldNow＊s platform . . . becoming WorldNow＊s second largest client (as of 2015, they have since switched to Lakana). In 2011, Meredith Corporation . . . began a four-year contract with WorldNow to operate its station websites. In January 2013, Media General reached a deal to move its eighteen stations to WorldNow, beginning with WFLA-TV.§ \nA ※media platform§ is a ※platform,§ medium or means of communicating news, such as a newspaper, TV station, Facebook , Twitter , or even a blog like FOTM . \nI typed ※worldnow.com§ in the URL bar of my laptop, but was brought to the webpage of Frankly Inc. with this URL: http://franklyinc.com/ . \nFrankly＊s ※About§ page says: \nWorldNow , the original broadcast arm of Frankly, was founded in 1999. We now serve over 200 stations across the United States as a true partner, offering customization services and strategic trainings on industry best practices for user engagement and monetization. \nFrankly＊s ※Investors§ page says: \n※ Our customers include NBC, ABC, CBS and FOX affiliates , as well as top fashion brands, professional sports franchises and global organizations.§ \nIn other words, WorldNow is a media software company that provides real-time data 每 such as election results 每 to local TV news stations like WRCBtv . \nYou can verify this for yourself by going on WRCBtv＊s website: http://www.wrcbtv.com/ . Scroll down to the bottom of WRCBtv＊s webpage, and you＊ll see this in the bottom left of the webpage: \nWRCBtv.com is ※powered by frankly§ and Frankly is the owner of WorldNow. In other words, WorldNow provides the content or the news for WRCBtv.com. \nStone claims that for now, WRCBtv.com＊s (predetermined) election results page is hidden, awaiting WorldNow to publicly post the (fake) election results sometime in the evening of November 8, Election Day. \nI can verify that the webpage is currently hidden. Here＊s what I did: I typed ※ftpcontent2.worldnow.com/wrcb/elections/elections.html§in the URL bar, but was brought to a McAfee Web Advisor page warning of ※Trouble ahead§ and asking me§Are you sure you want to go there?§ I then did a Yahoo search for ※WRCBtv.com decision 2016§. My search＊s results page has this at the top: \nNote that it says ※Decision 2016: Complete Election Results Posted§. I clicked the blue-colored ※ DECISION 2016: Complete Election Results § and was brought to this page of WRCBtv.com with the message: Our Apologies \nThe page you requested is currently unavailable. Pages on this site are constantly being revised, updated, and occasionally removed. You may have followed an outdated link or have outdated pages in your browser cache. Here＊s a screenshot I took: \nSo how did WorldNow come up with its predetermined final vote counts for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ? \nAnswer : A method called ※ fractional vote ※. \nTo begin, a fractional vote feature is embedded in the GEMS election management system of electronic voting machines , which counts approximately 25% of all votes in the United States. \nAs explained by Gun&Game , the fractional vote feature can be used to invisibly, yet radically, alter election outcomes by pre-setting desired vote percentages for the candidates. The tampering can be applied across large jurisdictions in less than 60 seconds; is not visible to election observers, even if they are standing in the room and watching the computer; and is unlikely to be detected by auditing or canvass procedures. \nGEMS vote-counting systems operate under five trade names: Global Election Systems, Diebold Election Systems, Premier Election Systems, Dominion Voting Systems, and Election Systems & Software, in addition to a number of private regional subcontractors. GEMS is used statewide in Alaska, Connecticut, Georgia, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Utah and Vermont, and for counties in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. It is also used in Canada. \nVote-rigging by electronic voting machines is real. \nA 2006 Emmy-nominated HBO documentary, Hacking Democracy , investigates the flawed integrity of electronic voting machines, particularly those made by Diebold Election Systems (now Global Election Systems), and exposes previously unknown backdoors in the Diebold trade secret computer software. Hacking Democracy documents American citizens investigating anomalies and irregularities with electronic voting systems during the 2000 and 2004 elections, especially in Volusia County, Florida. The film culminates in the on-camera hacking of the Diebold election system in Leon County, Florida 〞 the same computer voting system which has been used in elections across 39 states, and which still counts tens of millions of America＊s votes today. \nSo what is fractional or fractionalized vote? \nFractional vote is a method to distort the results of an election by ※weighting§ the votes. Instead of the principle of ※one person-one vote,§ some votes are counted not as 1, but as a fraction of or less than 1 (e.g., ? or ?), or as more than 1 (e.g., 1? or 1?). The distortion of ※one person-one vote§ is in order to achieve a pre-assigned percentage of votes for each candidate. For example, Candidate A is pre-assigned 51% of the votes, Candidate B 44%, and Candidate C gets the rest 〞 5%. \nAn algorithm is used to arrive at the pre-assigned percentages by changing the numbers automatically as the voting progresses. Although Candidate A in actuality received fewer number of votes than Candidate B, by ※weighting§ Candidate A＊s votes, those votes are distorted in value, with one vote being counted, say, 25 times, so that Candidate A is the winner. And although Candidate B actually received more votes than Candidate A, Candidate B＊s votes are ※weighted§ such that their values are less, with some votes converted to zero. The end result is that Candidate B loses. \nAccording to Jim Stone, below are the numerical votes and percentages that are the pre-assigned presidential election results for the various states , which are already on the ※Election Results§ webpage of WMCtv.com, a local TV station in Memphis, TN. (But if you go onto that webpage 〞 http://ftpcontent4.worldnow.com/wmctv/elections/wmc-electionresults.html 〞 now, all the values are 0): \nLine 119: US President Alabama Line 121: Donald Trump (R)

of election results on November 8, Jim Stone says that he＊d ※ripped the code out worldnow.com/kfvs12/elections.html§ and can confirm ※there is no active in it to need testing,\" i.e., \"the page has no code that will tabulate votes.\" The data on the hidden page are not codes, but are \"all just typed in.\" \nThere is another way to demonstrate vote rigging of the 2016 election -- a webpage on election results of KFVS12 , a local TV station in Cape Girardeau, MO: http://82.221.129.208/ftpcontent4worldnowcomkfvs12elections.html . \nThe webpage at present is a fakery in progress , with the final (fake) vote counts for some races already filled in, but blank for some other races. This afternoon, November 3, 2016, I took screenshots of every race with (fake) tabulations already filled in, but did not take screenshots of some blank races because I got tired of taking screenshots. The races with no (fake) vote counts are all minor races, such as those for city councils and local initiatives. \nAsk yourself this question: \nWhy would the website of KFVS12, a local TV station in Missouri, have the final vote counts for some races in the upcoming November 8 elections already filled in? \nIf KFVS12's election results webpage as it is now is merely a \"test-run\" to ensure that the webpage will be operative on November 8, why are the vote counts of some races -- all relatively unimportant local races -- blank? If the page is a \"test,\" there should be \"test\" vote counts for every race. \nCan anyone offer another explanation for what's been presented in this post? I'm open to alternative, non-election-fraud explanations. \nIs our entire democratic polity an illusion? \nH/t FOTM 's bongiornoc",

    "text": "It never ceases to amaze me how, blinded by their narcissism, Hollyweirdos and other pop culture ※celebrities§ are rank hypocrites, utterly devoid of introspection. \nThe latest exemplar: Pop singer Mariah Carey. \nCarey, 46, is the best-selling female singer of all time, with an estimate net worth of $500 million from her preternatural ability to screech like a dolphin in heat (apologies to dolphins). \nBorn in New York state, Carey is biracial 〞 her father is of African descent, her mother is of Irish descent 〞 which makes Mariah Carey a racial ※minority§ in the U.S. \nBeginning at the 0:58 mark in the video below, Carey says she agrees with protests over the lack of women and minorities in ※entertainment§ because: \n※I don＊t think women get a fair deal in anything . . . .

Rumors have it that one of the reasons for the breakup was her ※insane spending sprees§. \nAccording to an account in New York Post ＆s ※ Page Six § on Oct. 27, 2016, the following are examples of Carey＊s ※over-the-top . . . frenzied spending that may have doomed her engagement to Packer§: Sources say Carey ※regularly drops $10,000 to get her hair and makeup perfect 〞 even if it＊s all going to last just a single day.§ Power 105＊s The Breakfast Club radio host Charlamagne Tha God, aka Lenard McKelvey, who knows the singer, told The Post : ※Mariah is the last of the divas 〞 she＊s got a very old-school approach to stardom. It＊s champagne-in-the-morning type stuff.

McKelvey told The Post : ※I remember thinking to myself, damn, what kind of disposable income she has where she has her own lighting director?

    "title": "Comment on Evidence that Hillary Clinton and her associates are satanists by traildustfotm",
    "text": "Dr. Eowyn | 2 Comments \nI＊ve been blogging every day, every week, every month for more than 7 years now. \nBlogging for FOTM requires that I＊m really ※plugged in,§ ear-to-the-ground on news and goings on, including conspiracy theories. \nAfter more than 7 years of being ※plugged in,§ I＊ve come to the conclusion that the conspiracy theories that I, who began as an innocent, had initially thought to be outlandish turn out to be credible. That＊s my honest, sober observation 〞 from a person who is a full professor, has a Ph.D., was well-trained in and had taught epistemology and the scientific method to undergraduate and graduate students. I go to where the empirical evidence leads me. \nOne of the most far-out conspiracy theories is that a shadowy group of 谷lites controls governments. In the United States, those 谷lites variously are called shadow government, secret government or deep state. (See ※ Deep State: Who really rules America §) \nAn even more far-out version of that conspiracy theory is that the shadowy 谷lites are satanists. \nThis post is about Hillary Clinton and her close associates being satanists. Really. Exhibit A Larry Nichols in 2009 \nI originally reported the following more than a year ago in ※ Clinton friend and assassin Larry Nichols says Hillary Clinton is a satanist ※. \nLarry Nichols is a former Green Beret and a longtime associate of Bill Clinton. The two men first met in Arkansas in the late 1970s when Bill was an up-and-coming politician. When Bill was elected governor of Arkansas, he inserted Nichols as the marketing director of the Arkansas Development Finance Authority , an Arkansas state agency that was one of the entities investigated by the Senate Whitewater Committee . \nOn the Pete Santilli radio show on September 24, 2013, Nichols admitted that he had killed people as the Clintons＊ hit man or assassin-for-hire. (See ※ Bombshell: Long-time Clinton associate says he killed people for Bill & Hillary ※) \nOn June 24, 2015, interviewed by Alex Jones for InfoWars , Nichols dropped another bombshell. He said, beginning at the 28:44 mark in the audio above: \n※Back when Hillary was first lady, she would go home on the weekends to California with Linda Bloodworth-Thomason * and some of the other ladies of ＆Designing Women＊. And they went to a church for witches. Witches, witches, witches . . . . You know that lady that was tryin＊ to run for the Senate and sometimes she＊d gone to some place where they did witch stuff? Hillary went to a church and worshiped Satan . . . . What . . . I think is scaring the hell out of you: there are people that love them [Clintons], no matter what.§ \n* Note: Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, together with her husband Harry, was the producer of Designing Women , a popular TV sitcom (1986-1993). Exhibit B \nI first reported the following in a post about two months ago, ※ Hillary aide talks about animal sacrifice to demon Moloch in WikiLeaks email ※. \nIn early August 2016, WikiLeaks released a (hacked) email from W. Lewis Amselem to Cheryl Mills, Hillary＊s chief of staff. At the time of the email, Amselem served in the State Department under then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as head of the U.S. delegation to the Organization of American States (OAS). (He has since retired.) In the email, Amselem made mention of ※sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch§ 〞 an ancient demon. \nBelow is a screenshot I took of the WikiLeaks email (you can see the email for yourself here ). I painted a red bracket around the animal sacrifice phrase. \nIn the Old Testament , Gehenna was a valley by Jerusalem, where apostate Israelites and followers of various pagan gods sacrificed their children by fire (2 Chr. 28:3, 33:6; Jer. 7:31, 19:2每6). One of those gods was Moloch (aka Molech, Molekh, Molok, Molek, Molock, Moloc, Melech, Milcom or Molcom), an ancient Ammonite god who demanded a particular kind of propitiatory child sacrifice from parents. ( Amselem is a Sephardic Jewish surname.) Exhibit C \nThe latest evidence of satanism on the part of a Hillary Clinton associate is an email recently released by WikiLeaks . \nThe email was sent from Tony Podesta, a powerful Democrat lobbyist, to his brother John Podesta , a longtime Clinton associate who is the chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Tony had forwarded an invitation to attend a satanic ritual called ※spirit cooking dinner§ from Marina Abramovic, 69, a Serbian ※performance artist§ who now lives in New York. Abramovic＊s email says: \n※Dear Tony, \nI am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? ※ \nTony appended to Abramovic＊s invitation this message to John Podesta: \n※Are you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner. § Here＊s a screenshot of the email (you can view it on WikiLeaks here ): Paul Joseph Watson of InfoWars explains that ※spirit cooking§ is a ※sacrament§ in Thelema 〞 a religion founded by British occultist-satanist Aleister Crowley, whose motto was ※Do As Thou Wilt§〞 in which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are mixed to create a ※painting.§ According to Abramovic, if the ritual is performed in an art gallery, it is merely art, but if the ritual is performed privately, then ※spirit cooking§ is a ※spiritual ceremony§〞※to symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine§ and ※a representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism ＆As Above, So Below＊.§ Mike Cernovich cuts (no pun intended) to the quick: Spirit cooking is an ※occult practice used during sex cult rituals , as explained in the book Spirit cooking with essential aphrodisiac recipes .§ So who is Marina Abramovic? Let＊s begin with this disturbing image of Abramovic posing with a bloody goat＊s head 〞 a representation of Baphomet: Here＊s a video of Abramovic on ※spirit cooking painting§: Cassandra Fairbanks of WeAreChange.org has more information on Marina Abramovic: She is known for gory ※performance art§ in the name of ※confronting pain and ritual.§ One of Abramovic＊s performances involved repeatedly stabbing herself in her hands. Another featured her throwing her nails, toenails, and hair into a flaming pentagram, then jumping inside the pentagram and fainting. Exhibit D \nMany FBI agents involved in the now re-opened criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s emails, who we would expect to know more about her than we do, regard Hillary Clinton as the antiChrist. \nSpencer Ackerman reports for The Guardian , Nov. 4, 2016: \n※Deep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. \nCurrent and former FBI officials, none of whom were willing or cleared to speak on the record, have described a chaotic internal climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey＊s July decision not to recommend an indictment over Clinton＊s maintenance of a private email server on which classified information transited. \n＆The FBI is Trumpland,＊ said one current agent. [＃] \nThe currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is ＆the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel ,＊ and that ＆the reason why they＊re leaking is they＊re pro-Trump.＊§ \nH/t FOTM ＆s Anon and Will Shanley \nSee also:",

    "text": "DCG | 4 Comments \nAnother Hollyweird Clinton supporter being trashy . Thank goodness this election is over soon. \nFrom Daily Mail : She is no stranger to baring it all for her series Girls. But now Lena Dunham is stripping down to show support for her presidential hopeful. \nThe 30-year-old comedienne released a rap video to help campaign for Hillary Clinton on comedy website Funny Or Die on Thursday. The three-minute clip was titled Sensual Pantsuit Anthem and featured Tony Award winning performer Cynthia Erivo and radio/television personality Charlamagne Tha God. \nPerhaps the most eye-opening scene of the entire gag is when Lena decides to ditch her red pantsuit to reveal a matching two-piece bikini-like number. As she is ripping off her clothing she rhymes: ＆And now I＊m going to take off my pantsuit to reveal a more sensual pantsuit cause that＊s what you do for the candidate you love.＊ \nThe 36-year-old of Power 105.1＊s The Breakfast Club replies: ＆Not sure I really understand the logic here. The rapping is trash and why are you wearing Hillary＊s lingerie?＊ Charlamagne presses her on the rationale behind the decision to rap and strip down and Lena hopes for some female solidarity as she says: ＆Dance with me Cynthia take your pantsuit off and show us your sensual pantsuit Cynthia.＊ The 29-year-old actress and singer is not so keen as she sings: ＆No I＊m good!＊ \nThis leaves Lena to question the entire video as she says: ＆I wonder if I＊m actually hurting her chances of winning.＊ The video concludes with Charlamagne reminding everyone to vote on Tuesday, November 8. \nLena has been unafraid to show her allegiance to Hillary leading up to the election as she used her Halloween costume for a bit of political satire just a few days ago. \nOn Monday, the Girls creator dressed up as a cat but had hands fastened to her body so that she was a ＆grabbed p***y＊. \nRead the rest of the story here . \nDCG",

    "text": "| November 5, 2016 at 1:54 pm | Reply \nThis election is one to be studied for years to come. I cannot, with certainty, predict the outcome, although my gut tells me that Hillary will APPEAR to win, via massive vote and electronic machine rigging and hacking, but that Donald Trump CAN successfully litigate to prove this and thus reverse such an outcome. Rest assured there is more than enough skullduggery to go around (on the Democratic side, and limited on the Republican side to the Bush Dynasty and their neo-con front.) I admit my gut feeling may be absolutely wrong: Donald Trump may win by such a landslide that the Soros-Hillary strategy may be ※aborted.§ This would be good! (I would also relish the humiliation of the Bush Machine! I want to see them gnash their teeth!) I also follow Dr. Steve Piecenzik, who declared on Alex Jones＊s radio show on Tue., Nov. 1st, that a ※silent coup§ is under way in America. He announced that various intelligence sources in the U.S. have been the source of the Wikileaks program. He said that there are certain elements in the intelligence community that have made it clearly known to the Hillary Camp that she will not be allowed to serve. Let us hope that this maintains. \nIn the meantime, we still have our own bubbles to pop out of. I admit I do. There is so much more to study and learn. And it shall be HIGH TIME for the former Goldwater Girl (gone Mad!), Hillary, the Klownish Koughing Kween, to be dumped into the Ashbin of History. Once this happens, the bubble her supporters are living in will finally be popped. For this, History ※don＊t need no stinking Supreme Court!§ IT＊S COMING.",

    "text": "Posted on August 4, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 51 Comments \nWhatever happens on November 8, Donald Trump can claim this achievement: His candidacy exposed the fact that the two-party system of Democrats and Republicans is an illusion. \nWhat we have in the U.S. instead is a corrupt polity where Democrat and Republican 谷lites form a single ruling party, as Professor Emeritus Angelo M. Codevilla stunningly asserted in 2010. (See ※ America＊s Bipartisan Ruling Class vs. the People ※) \nThe evidence? \nThe following list of Republican bigwigs who, by publicly declaring their support for Hillary Clinton 〞 the pathological liar who had accomplished nothing as secretary of state, but violated U.S. laws and jeopardized national security with her unsecured private email server; lied about and left four Americans to die in Benghazi; and supports the absolute ※right§ of women to kill their unborn 〞 instead of Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump, have peeled away their masks, revealing their true faces. \nHere＊s a list of the Republican 谷lites who have declared they＊ll vote for Hillary: Dan Akerson , former chairman and chief executive of General Motors: ＆＆Serving as the leader of the free world requires effective leadership, sound judgment, a steady hand and, most importantly, the temperament to deal with crises large and small. Donald Trump lacks each of these characteristics.＊＊ Marc Andreessen , venture capitalist: ＆＆[Silicon] Valley wouldn＊t be here, we wouldn＊t be doing any of this if we didn＊t have the amazing flow of immigrants that we＊ve had in the last 80 years. And the idea of choking that off just makes me sick to my stomach.＊＊ Richard Armitage , deputy secretary of state and adviser to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush: Trump ＆＆doesn＊t appear to be a Republican, he doesn＊t appear to want to learn about issues. So I＊m going to vote for Mrs. Clinton.＊＊ Max Boot , senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and adviser to GOP presidential candidates: ＆＆I＊m literally losing sleep over Donald Trump. She would be vastly preferable to Trump.＊＊ Sally Bradshaw , former top Jeb Bush adviser, who told CNN that she left the GOP and became an independent because of Trump: ※As much as I don＊t want another four years of Obama＊s policies, I can＊t look my children in the eye and tell them I voted for Donald Trump.＊＊ Arne Carlson , a former two-term Republican governor of Minnesota who supported Obama. Jim Cicconi , former Reagan and George H.W. Bush aide: ＆＆Hillary Clinton is experienced, qualified and will make a fine president. The alternative, I fear, would set our nation on a very dark path.＊＊ Eliot Cohen , former Bush administration official who has been called ※the most influential neocon in academe,§ declared Clinton ※the lesser evil, by a large margin.§ Maria Comella , former spokeswoman for governors Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani: ＆＆Instead of speaking out against instances of bigotry, racism and inflammatory rhetoric whether it＊s been against women, immigrants, or Muslims, we made a calculus that it was better to say nothing at all in the interest of politics and winning elections.＊＊ Doug Elmets , former Reagan spokesman: ＆＆I could live with four years of Hillary Clinton before I could ever live with one day of Donald Trump as president.＊＊ Elmets spoke at the Democratic National Convention, along with other Republicans now backing Clinton. Mike Fernandez , $4 million to GOP candidates in recent years: ＆＆If I have a choice 〞 and you can put it in bold 〞 if I have a choice between Trump and Hillary Clinton, I＊m choosing Hillary. She＊s the lesser of two evils.＊＊ Charles Fried , US solicitor general under Reagan and current Harvard Law School professor: ＆＆Though long a registered Republican, this will be the third consecutive presidential election in which my party forces the choice between party and, in John McCain＊s words, putting America first. . . . It is to [Mitt] Romney＊s credit that this year, like John Paulson and George Will, he is standing up against the brutal, substantively incoherent, and authoritarian tendencies of Donald Trump.§ Richard Hanna , a ※moderate§ Republican Congressman (NY) who is retiring this year, told The Syracuse Post Standard he will support Hillary because Trump is unfit to lead: ※I think Trump is a national embarrassment. Is he really the guy you want to have the nuclear codes?§ Ben Howe , contributing editor at RedState.com. Robert Kagan , senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; former Reagan State Department aide and adviser to the campaigns of John McCain and Mitt Romney; will vote for Hillary. Peter Mansoor , retired Army colonel and former aide to disgraced general David Petraeus: ＆＆It will be the first Democratic presidential candidate I＊ve voted for in my adult life.＊＊ Hamid Moghadam , chairman and chief executive of Prologis: ＆＆Our country is about tolerance and inclusion and that＊s why, as a lifelong Republican supporter, I endorse Hillary Clinton for president in this election.＊＊ William Oberndorf , $3 million to GOP candidates since 2012: ＆＆If it is Trump vs. Clinton, and there is no viable third-party candidate, I will be voting for Hillary Clinton.＊＊ Henry Paulson , treasury secretary to George W. Bush. Paulson wrote: ※When it comes to the presidency, I will not vote for Donald Trump. ＆I will not cast a write-in vote. I＊ll be voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world. To my Republican friends: I know I＊m not alone.＊＊ Larry Pressler , former three-term Republican senator from South Dakota: ＆＆I can＊t believe I＊m endorsing Hillary Clinton for president, but I am. If someone had told me 10 years ago I would do this, I wouldn＊t have believed them.＊＊ Chuck Robbins , chief executive of Cisco. Mark Salter , former top adviser to John McCain: ＆＆Whatever Hillary Clinton＊s faults, she＊s not ignorant or hateful or a nut. She acts like an adult and understands the responsibilities of an American president. That might not be a ringing endorsement. But in 2016, the year of Trump＊s s campaign, it＊s more than enough.＊＊ Kori Schake , National Security Council and State Department aide. Robert Smith , former judge on New York＊s highest court, the Court of Appeals: ＆＆This year, I＊m going to vote for a Democrat for president 〞 the first time I＊ve done it in 36 years 〞 and I think the decision is easy. Hillary Clinton is the only responsible choice, and I don＊t understand why so few of my fellow conservatives see it that way.＊＊ Brent Scowcroft , chairman of the President＊s Intelligence Advisory Board and adviser to three previous GOP presidents: ＆＆The presidency requires the judgment and knowledge to make tough calls under pressure . . . [Clinton] has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time.＊＊ Craig Snyder , former chief of staff to then-Republican former senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and also an ex-colleague of former top Trump adviser Roger Stone and current top Trump adviser Paul Manafort. Alan Steinberg , regional EPA administrator. Mike Treiser , former Mitt Romney aide: ＆＆In the face of bigotry, hatred, violence, and small-mindedness, this time, I＊m with her.＊＊ Meg Whitman , Hewlett Packard executive; former California gubernatorial contender. \nAdd to the above list Glenn Beck , the billionaire Koch brothers , Bill Kristol ( National Review ), Mitt Romney , Karl Rove , and Ben Shapiro ( National Review ), who, although not declaring they＊ll vote for Hillary, are reported to be adamantly opposed to Trump. \nHere are the Republicans who will vote for the Libertarian Party＊s Johnson-Weld ticket and so effectively assure a Hillary win : Martin Avila , CEO of Terra Eclipse, former Digital Campaign Director to former Rep. Ron Paul, member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld＊s steering committee. Julie Germany , Interim Executive Director of the White Coat Waste Project, former COO of Generation Opportunity, member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld steering committee.

Keith Velia , finance industry leader; Republican Liberty Caucus of Connecticut Treasurer; Ridgefield Republican Town Committee Associate; member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld steering committee. \nAs The Daily Bell observes: \nThere is only one party: pro-war and pro-technocratic (corporatist). \nThe fundamental mythology of US politics is that the Democrats are socialist-oriented and Republicans believe in freedom and individual human rights. \nBut Hillary is corporatist, not socialist＃. \nImportant Republicans call Trump＊s stances ※brutal, substantively incoherent, and authoritarian.§ \nStrangely, Hillary＊s actions and statements provide evidence of the very authoritarianism and brutality that Trump is being accused of. \nWhen she and her husband entered the White House, one of the very first things Hillary did was fire the staff of the travel office in order to put her own people in place. \nShe didn＊t just fire the staff however, she also tried to get the head of the office, Director Billy Dale, put in jail for embezzlement. He was subsequently found not guilty and Hillary herself was investigated for initiating the firings and making false accusations. \nHer intimidation and blackmailing of her husband＊s lovers is well known by this point- and thus her campaign＊s emphasis on ※women＊s rights§ is ironic to say the least. \nHer voting record and statements reveal an individual who is most comfortable with US serial wars abroad, no matter the reason (or lack of reasons). \nAdditional accusations against Hillary and her husband include violence and even murder of individuals whose interests diverged from theirs. \nMost notably, Hillary has been accused of orchestrating the death of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. \nNone of this seems to register with Republicans who are ※crossing over§＃. \nConclusion: Whatever else takes place during this federal election, the disintegration of the credibility of the two-party system is perhaps the most important development of all. \nSee also:",

    "text": "Donald Trump & Hillary Clinton: Two Figures in a Derailed World What is the Way Out? By Dieter Duhm / terranovavoice.tamera.org \nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton 每 truly two representatives of a derailed world. Both hold up a mirror to our current society. One spoke for the establishment; the other for people's rage against the establishment. Rage prevailed, yet both represent the exact same system, just from two different angles. The fact that Trump won, taking into account all the outrageous things he said, shows what kind of turbulent revolt arises among large parts of the American population. It is the revolt of people who feel betrayed by an unfathomable system and who call for, as so often already, a strong leader. Thus the unrestrained demagogue gets on stage, calling for restoring the nation, for security and unity, and the common fight against all those who could disturb this unity. Sorry to say, w hat comes together here is something we have already once seen in the collective insanity under Hitler. But things will not go so far this time because there is neither a concept nor a political vision behind all these ※tremendous§ words. Through the grotesque victory of this megalomaniac player, a movement for freedom could arise in the United States, one which strives for new objectives beyond the existing parties. In addition, positive counter-powers rise up across the globe 每 these are the ones that will set the course of things on a new track. Both ways, the one of Trump and Clinton alike, aim toward a deeply inhumane world; both generate unspeakably many victims. The emotional substratum Donald Trump activates is directed against all those of another race, religion or sexual identity. This is self-protection by way of exterminating others. Hillary Clinton pursues the policies of the political class, of calculated globalization, in collaboration with the international dictatorship of financial power, generating victims in all parts of the planet that are subdued by this globalization. This is the self-protection of the dominating system through market strategies and military force. Donald Trump has alleviated the souls of his audience by granting them permission to think the thoughts they anyway do. It has been a fundamental feature throughout human history that people come to power who are able to mobilize the subliminal ※mass psychology of fascism§ as Wilhelm Reich called it 每 this hunger for unity under a powerful ruler. This story has been repeating for millennia and will continue repeating until we put an end to it. Humanity needs a new life order with a new vision of leadership and unity. What is meant is not external leadership, but leadership coming from within . It is not the unity proclaimed through banners and election slogans, but the inner unity of people who coexist in trust to assist fellow beings and serve the Earth. We refer to the unity in the natural connectedness with the great family of life 每 in the self-evident empathy, love and solidarity that immediately come into being when we reach the basis of trust, mutual acceptance and truth. This is the foundation for a life in love, power and health. Another kind of society will arise from this fundament, no longer based on power and capital, but on the truth within human relations. And if our estimate is right, this society will be compatible with the higher order of life, which we call the ※Sacred Matrix.§ This movement will give rise to many new centers, birthplaces of a new planetary community. We need to get there, otherwise we will content ourselves with substitutive solutions that regularly lead to catastrophes. As humanity we have long worked with these substitutions. We have set up ideological, political, religious and moral systems intending to secure a fulfilled existence for ourselves. Yet now we are collectively facing the edge of abyss. The era of these substitutions has come to an end. Fascism was a substitution; capitalism was a substitution; the ideas of power and obedience, of autocracy and democracy were a substitution; the Catholic Church was a substitution; the mystic paths all the way to Nirvana were a substitution. The Chosen People, all the smaller and bigger empires, all gods were a substitution; and renouncing all gods and teaching materialistic nihilism was a substitution too. Today, we need another solution on a different social, interpersonal, ethical and spiritual foundation. We need a solution based on truth among real people, above all between the genders, man and woman, because this is the realm that has been most terribly destroyed by the violence of patriarchal history. In other words, if we want to end the worldwide injustice and the unspeakable suffering of humanity and the animal kingdom, we need to base the entire civilization of this planet on another foundation. Neither Trump nor Clinton will assist us here; what is required is a fundamental correction of our civilization and a new vision for inhabiting our planet. I know this sounds out of touch with reality, but it is inevitable and can clearly be done. If there is the vision of a humane existence on Earth it can also be realized. All people are made of the same matter. It is not just fantasy when we see the ONE, which is the same in everyone, within ourselves and all fellow citizens of this planet. We all come from the same universe, are reached by the same sun and have all come to this world from between the enormous legs of our Great Mother. We all share the same longing for love and peace. We all are happy about the friendliness of our alleged opponents 每 and we all would be able to make this friendliness our guiding orientation, could we let go of old, negative forces. For example in Colombia 每it is clear that there are the same souls, the same young people, the same hopes and goals in both conflicting parties. It is clear that there is a potential friendship behind this cruel hostility. Isn't it also clear that there is an original love even behind the fiercest relationship crises, that which has once brought the two together? Likewise, there is another possibility of existence behind the entire massacre of this world, which we recognize when we are not entangled in conflicts. We can understand what love is, how to follow its rules and what a global community of love could look like. We can also see the social, ecological and ethical preconditions needed to make it happen. These preconditions give rise to a new concept of coexistence among people, as well as between people and animals, people and nature. This is what we call the ※ Global Healing Biotopes Project .§ Slowly spreading, the project works to create a new global field stronger than all violence. We do not tolerate any cruelty on this planet. In the name of love for all that lives. Further Reading:",

    "title": "For All Democrats to Ponder: the Real Reasons Hillary Clinton Lost",
    "text": "For All Democrats to Ponder: the Real Reasons Hillary Clinton Lost Beyond the media spin, the four reasons for this defeat. By Tony Brasunas / medium.com As the aphorism goes, if we don＊t learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it. While the corporate media continues to peddle hysteria, the most important thing right now is to rationally understand why Clinton and the Democrats lost this eminently winnable 2016 race for the White House. Having taken some time to look back over the past six months, I list below what I believe are the four main underlying reasons for this defeat. As it turns out, none of the reasons is particularly complicated, but each will require consideration and systemic change by the party over the next two years. 1. The DNC subverted democracy. This was an anti-establishment year in politics, and there was an anti-establishment candidate running in both major parties. Trump was (barely) allowed to win the primary on the Republican side. On the Democratic side, despite Bernie＊s obvious strength and the clear preference of the grassroots, the primary was rigged to put the less popular, establishment candidate forward. It was a colossal risk to take, but the party leadership in the DNC chose to advance their favored candidate so as to maintain their power inside the party and their fundraising with big banks and supranational corporations. The risk backfired. Free and fair democracy would have given Bernie the nomination, likely the White House, and even better, leadership in an expanding and exciting party positioned to win elections for years to come. 2. The media and the DNC deliberately elevated Trump. The wikileaks reveal that the DNC chose to deliberately use the Clinton campaign and the media to elevate Trump (as well as Ted Cruz and Ben Carson) as a candidate, thinking he would be the easiest to beat. They utilized this ※pied piper§ strategy for months. This was another colossal risk the DNC took, and it backfired horribly. Partly in tandem with the DNC 〞 but largely of their own volition 〞 the corporate media lavished hour upon hour of free coverage on Trump, daily, for a solid year. It is the height of irony today for corporate media pundits to bemoan with shock and consternation Trump＊s victory, when his candidacy is truly their creation. If any candidate receives hours of coverage by the major media, for free, every single night, for a year, he or she will win elections, and possibly the presidency. 3. Clinton ran a weak and uninspired campaign. Once she had the nomination, Clinton ran a campaign without an inspiring message 〞 other than perhaps voting for a woman for president. She courted conservatives like the Bushes, the Kochs, and Henry Kissinger, she picked corporate centrists for vice president and other prominent roles, she never connected with a base that after all of Bernie＊s amazing campaigning was ripe for engagement, and she turned her back on progressive issues time and again. She stopped talking about climate change and racial justice and corruption in government, and she never addressed the pressing progressive issues of the day, such as Standing Rock and TPP. Seemingly she hoped to coast to victory with little more than platitudes and scare-tactics about Russians reminiscent of the 1950s. All of this while barely escaping two FBI indictments. She became a weak and unpopular candidate holding on to a narrow lead merely because Trump was so ridiculously bad. Trump＊s inadequacy as a candidate masked the weaknesses in Clinton＊s sinking campaign. For its part, as a slogan, ※Stronger Together§ never resonated with people who haven＊t recovered yet from the Great Recession and who continue to get by with less everyday; indeed for poor and working class people who feel on the outside of the country＊s latest wealth generation, this slogan seemed at best ironic and at worst to deliberately exclude them. 4. The complete failure of neoliberalism. This is perhaps the most important thing to understand. Trump didn＊t win because of racism; that only got him, generously, 20% of the vote. Trump won by 〞 like Bernie 〞 offering everyday people an alternative to the utterly failed policies of neoliberalism. Not to scare you with this big word, but we are hearing (hopefully) the final death knell of the fancy idea, born under the Clintons, that the country could pass corporate-supremacy laws, call them ※free trade§ deals, and allow corporations to seek the cheapest, least regulated labor, anywhere in the world, and leave the country that supports these corporations high and dry. It＊s a fabulous deal for corporations 〞 their profits have soared 〞 but it＊s a wretched deal for working class people, the environment, unions, towns and cities, and long-term national sovereignty for the nations of the earth. People were bound to finally wake up to this, and now they have. If you don＊t know what the TPP is, please go learn; Hillary and Obama want to pass this crown jewel of corporate supremacy; Bernie and Trump oppose it. There are your real reasons. Getting this right does matter, so let me know if I＊ve missed anything. Honorable mentions not making the top four: Fraudulent voter purges in Florida and Ohio that favored Republicans. Voting machine election fraud. More research on this topic forthcoming. The electoral college. Clinton did win the popular vote nationwide but will lose the count of state delegates in this undemocratic system. Independent voters, progressive voters, and libertarian voters who didn＊t vote, or who voted for other candidates because the DNC＊s candidate didn＊t inspire them should be considered symptoms of the above, not reasons unto themselves. If you run an unpopular candidate on a platform of failed policies and simultaneously elevate your opponent, you will lose any remotely fair democratic election. If you run an unpopular candidate on a platform of failed policies and simultaneously elevate your opponent, you will lose. The question now is whether the Democratic Party can right its ship and finally turn away from neoliberalism and corrupt corporate politics. Can the DNC, over the next two years, relinquish its corrupt role in guiding the party and allow the grassroots to return the party to its best historic role as genunine representatives for poor and working class people, the environment, democracy, and the rule of law? Personally I＊m skeptical , but I am ready and happy to be proven wrong. Liberals, progressives, and peaceful revolutionaries of all stripes: There are many more battles ahead. Keep fighting, keep learning, and above all keep paying attention. We must learn from this election so as not to repeat it. Tony Brasunas - Where rationalism and idealism meet. 0.0 ﹞",

    "title": "Trump, Hillary, and the End of the US Empire: A Russian View",
    "text": "October 29, 2016 -  By Eduard Popov for Fort Russ - translated by J. Arnoldski - \n\n\nFor the first time since the Cold War, the ※Russian question§ has become an important part of the debates between US presidential candidates. In turn, Russia is highly interested in a favorable outcome of the elections in the United States. In Russia itself, discussion has long been raging over which one of the US presidential candidates is better for Russia＊s interests: Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?  \nRussian society＊s sympathy undoubtedly belongs to Donald Trump, as Clinton has a high disapproval rating given her personal qualities and approach to Russia. If she is elected president of the United States, then she will likely become the most unpopular head of the White House in Russian public opinion. \nThe ※Russian question§ is part of a more global question of the new world system in which the US is losing its status as the world＊s sole superpower. Russia is playing an important role in changing the American Empire＊s status, perhaps even a leading one. But the American crisis is even more comprehensive and goes far beyond Russia＊s influence. A Russia dreaming of returning its former imperial greatness is less to blame for the fall of the US＊ imperial influence than the irrationality of the American elites themselves.  \nRussia survived two collapses in the 20th century consequential of internal factors.  The two Russian revolutions of the 20th century (1917 and 1991) were the result of a low quality of the ruling class and the undermining of their authority in society. The external factor was important, but still only a subsidiary cause of the collapse of the government and society. I believe that America is facing a similar crisis.  \nAs the author of these lines was told 10 years ago by an astute and recognized scholar, a former citizen of the USSR who emigrated to the US in the early 1990＊s, America is today undergoing the same wrenching transformations that the Soviet Union experienced in the Perestroika period. This scholar＊s view of the future of his new homeland was exclusively pessimistic - he believed that the US would not cope with its own restructuring primarily because of the unsuitability of its own elites. \nOf course, my opinion as a person who knows little of America and the opinion of the more knowledgeable above-mention citizen are only personal ones. But the emergence of the phenomenon of Donald Trump is not a detail, but an objective consequences of the deep crisis of the American system.  \nThe Trump phenomenon demonstrates at least two critical factors: (1) the complete alienation of the American elites (or as the Czech communist ideologist Dr. Skala says, the American ＆nomenklatura＊) from the people, and (2) the American nomenklatura＊s complete loss of touch with reality. Both are painfully reminiscent of the situation in the USSR before Perestroika.  \nThe late Soviet elites (the ＆nomenklatura,＊ as they were pejoratively called in society) turned into a closed caste. Even though, in my opinion, they were still more democratic than the current American elite, the Soviet nomenklatura sacrificed the interests of real modernization of the country＊s social-economic system and ideology for the sake of pursuing geopolitical phantoms. Perhaps I am wrong, but such \"false idols\" prevail in the minds of the current American nomenklatura even more.  \nIn the US, factories are closing, migration is growing, Mexico is slowly realizing a Reconquista (the return of their lands in the southwestern states of the US that were annexed as a result of an unjust war), and all of this is happening against the backdrop of imperial overstretch. The US is striving to control not only its backyard, Latin America (which is being actively penetrated by Chinese capital, another manifestation of the phantom thinking of the American nomenklatura), but also Ukraine, for which Russia is ready to fight to the last breath.  \nAmerica does not have the strength for this. But the American nomenklatura does not have the slightest interest in taking care of things at home and concentrating on domestic issues. Continuing American expansion is akin to Trotsky＊s permanent revolution. Such is intriguing and vivid, while home repairs and cleaning toilets is infinitely boring and tedious. \nThis is why the US presidential elections will be won by the political lunatic and American Trotskyist, Hillary Clinton, who does not strive for realism or call for cleaning the Augean stables like Donald Trump does. \n\nObviously, for Russia it is better to deal with a US government which defends its own national interests, not phantoms of pseudo-democracy and its declining imperial power. But little depends on Russia＊s opinion. Therefore, it is advisable to prepare for and objectively observe the course of the fight whose outcome is practically a foregone conclusion.  \n\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \n                                                   \n\n       Follow us on Twitter! \n                               \n\n             Donate!",

    "title": "Free Market Economic Recovery with Trump or Global Collectivism with Hillary",
    "text": "Print \nTwo weeks before the most outrageous presidential election in history, the stakes for the economic future of our country are high. There is no question that the U.S. economy is in terrible shape and that the policy decisions made in the last ten years have negatively affected everyone who trades, invests, and use the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency. Are voters going to choose free market economic recovery with Trump or global collectivism with Clinton? \nThe government statistics claim that there are officially 8 million unemployed but the actual unemployment numbers are closer to 16 million people. The reported labor force of almost 156 million in 2000 has shrunk to 152 million today. The reported number of Americans ※not in the labor force§ is an astonishing 94 million. These are discouraged workers who are no longer counted as unemployed. This explains why this administration＊s unemployment numbers are so rosy and low. For up to date numbers, visit the national debt clock here. http://www.usdebtclock.org/ \nOur national debt is astronomical, approaching $20 trillion while GDP is below $19 trillion. We already owe more than we make in a year in final goods and services. Gross debt to GDP ratio is 106.38 percent. The U.S. total debt is $67 trillion. However, if we add all the unfunded liabilities such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and Obamacare , the figure jumps much higher. \nThe federal budget deficit (the difference between taxation and spending) is almost $6 trillion for this year. The more indebted we are to the rest of the world and to each other, the less money will be available for future generations to improve their standard of living and to defend themselves. \nThere are approximately 119 million U.S. taxpayers and approximately 124 million full-time workers. The biggest part of the revenue from taxation is spent on entitlements. Somehow, Social Security, a fund established with automatic paycheck contributions, has been lumped in with entitlements as if the Social Security fund did not belong to the tax payers but to the government. \nOur Congress loves to spend money on entitlements because the recipients vote them back into office. Revenue to GDP ratio is a positive 35.6 percent but spending to GDP ratio is a red 36.04 percent. \nDuring the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said that she would make sure public college education will be free, that parents will not receive a bill for their children＊s college degree, and she will do it by not adding one penny to the national debt. \nAfter fact checking the statement, it turns out to be not true. One source claims that $500 billion will be added to the national debt in the next 10 years while the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that ※$200 billion will be spent on infrastructure, financial aid for college students, and early childhood education.§ \nThe current student loan debt is $1.4 trillion and growing. There are 50,182,018 public school students who will eventually take advantage of this ※free§ college offer Hillary Clinton has made. Who is going to pay? Taxpayers, of course, will be saddled with the cost. \nAdditionally, how is she going to create jobs to employ college graduates if her plan includes raising taxes? Employers create jobs when their taxes are decreased. NAFTA, which was President Bill Clinton＊s achievement, has exported many manufacturing jobs overseas. Hillary Clinton supports the highly secretive Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would finish off the manufacturing sector in this country, leaving the United States as a service economy. \nWe now have 12,500,256 manufacturing jobs left in this country. In 2000 we had 19,462,745 manufacturing jobs. There are about 120 million private sector jobs but large companies are pushing for more H-1B visas to import cheap technical labor from India and other foreign nations, leaving seasoned employees out of a job and having to train their replacements. More college graduates living in their parents＊ basement will have to work as baristas in coffee shops. \nTrump is in favor of school choice and wants to end Common Core. He favors the reintroduction of Vocational and Technical education, as well as making two and four-year college education affordable. \nDonald Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA and to withdraw from TPP. He wants to end foreign trade abuses and currency manipulation by China. He wants to repatriate our own companies by reducing corporate taxation significantly and by establishing tariffs to prevent companies from leaving in the first place. He wants to offer middle class tax relief that would help create 25 million jobs. He wants to simplify the tax code. \nTrump wants to create jobs by lifting regulatory restrictions on fossil fuel exploration and all mining. He wants to ※lift road blocks that prevent the Keystone pipeline from moving forward.§ \nTrump wants to cancel payments to the United Nations Climate Fund and use the money to fix our water and environmental infrastructure. \nHillary Clinton wants to expand illegal immigration and open borders while Trump wants to cancel federal funding of sanctuary cities that harbor criminal illegal aliens. He will ※suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.§ \nHe will establish punishments for visa overstays, for repeat criminal offenders, and multiple illegal border crossings. Adamant that he will build the wall with Mexico, Trump promises to remove criminal aliens from the U.S. and to cancel visas to countries that won＊t take them back. \nRestoring the rule of law, dismantling criminal gangs, establishing a task force on violent crime to help police, cleaning up corruption, and admitting immigrants who have been thoroughly vetted, who want to be a contributing part of our country, should go a long way to begin the process of healing our nation. \nHillary wants to continue President Obama＊s policies, including the admittance of many more ※refugees§ from countries that are inimical to us. \nWhile Hillary wants to develop Obamacare into a one payer system, Trump wants to ※repeal and replace§ the very costly and unaffordable Affordable Care Act which has made healthcare premiums unaffordable for so many Americans who were forced to drop their insurance and just pay the tax penalty. \nTrump favors health savings accounts, letting states manage Medicaid funds, and allowing Americans to buy insurance across state lines. Cutting the red tape at the FDA is also on his radar. He promises to fix VA hospitals and to allow veterans to be treated by their chosen doctor in any private or public hospital. \nWill Trump have the opportunity to replace Justice Scalia or will Hillary alter the composition of the Supreme Court, turning it into a bastion of progressivism for generations to come? \nTrump promises to expand and strengthen our military, to guard our First and Second Amendments, and to protect our Constitution. \nIt is time that American hard-earned dollars take care of Americans first instead of providing for the rest of the world to the detriment of poor Americans, redistributing our wealth through schemes that the globalists behind Hillary Clinton have devised. Americans want to have secure borders, sovereignty, one language, self-determination, and economic prosperity through free markets not through collectivism. shares",

    "title": "Puppet Hillary's Blame Game",
    "text": "During the 3 rd presidential debate Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton laughably claimed that self-made billionaire, Donald Trump 〞a political outsider〞was a puppet, rather than herself: \n※He'd [Vladimir Putin] rather have a puppet as president of the United States.§ \n※No puppet, no puppet＃ You're the puppet,§ was Mr. Trump's honest reply. \nExcuse me, but which scandal-embroiled candidate made a dirty U.S. uranium deal with Russia? Which same one blatantly broke American law and fostered potential espionage? As with everything two-faced Hillary says, the truth opposes her own words and deeds. Via Charity-gate , Mrs. Clinton did the former; with Server-gate, she did the latter. Thus, at the debate, she falsely accused Trump of her own crimes. This behavior is classical psychological projection: her own deep-seeded guilt blamed on her innocent political opponent. \nBeyond a worthless apology, Hillary's blame game never includes herself. Mr. Trump's call to Russia to release her illegally destroyed emails (if they have them) isn't espionage. He has nothing to do with what was left unprotected or has likely been stolen. First, wasn't it Hillary who intentionally had unauthorized, private servers set up in the first place as Secretary of State? Second, wasn't it Mrs. Clinton's responsibility to follow the law forbidding such extraneous storage of classified information? Third, since she knowingly ignored the rules, doesn't she own the consequences of hackers and potentially ※interfering§ foreign governments in next month's election? \nHillary has aided Russia, the foreign government she now publicly demonizes. In reality, if anyone is a hypothetical puppet of Putin's, it's Hillary Clinton , not Donald Trump. Specifically, her State Department approved the Uranium One deal, which insanely ceded Russian control of 20% of American produced uranium for a fat donation to her pay for play sham of a charity, the Clinton Foundation . (That's the highly prized ※ yellow cake § used in nuclear weapons.) What's to stop the Kremlin from sharing the extra supply with their Middle East allies, the nuclearly ambitious Iranian Imams ? You know, the same bearded fellows who finessed a toothless, Obama-approved nuclear deal that virtually guarantees them the bomb within the next decade? The answer to all of the above is nothing at all. \nMoreover, if the Soviets do have her destroyed emails, Mr. Putin has a treasure trove of top secret material with which to blackmail the normally paranoid and self-obsessed Hillary . Therefore, Mrs. Clinton would waste critical years in office (vital to the continued solvency of America) looking only to save her own skin. Indeed, the next president must contend with the escalating, unsustainable 19.7T debt . (That sounds like a wheelhouse challenge to a businessman and job creator like Donald Trump .) \nYet, Hillary's not up to that, or anything constructive. Crooked Hillary will be embroiled in ever worsening scandals, and future Nixon style cover-ups. Just like her impeached hubby Bill, she'll remain in an endless cycle of political damage control. Recall her already well-established track record of incompetence and lawlessness. While the country seizes in a hellish Clinton Administration death spiral, how would this divisive rabble-rouser lead〞except disastrously〞over a social and economic cliff? \nIt doesn't take a dummy to know who's better for America's future . If ventriloquists were Wall Street bankers, speechifying ※Hillary six figures§ would be their open borders , amnesty-promising marionette. Brassy Donald Trump should not be confused with any of that. Unlike the shifty one percenters who finance Mrs. Clinton's corrupt candidacy, Donald Trump's a captain of industry who can't be bought. He already has all of the fame, wealth and power anyone could want. America needs his tell-it-like-it-is 'can-do' optimism〞not an elitist figurehead for foreign and domestic special interest groups, and corporate masters. shares",

    "title": "A Vote For Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For World War 3",
    "text": "Print \nIf you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as ※dangerous§ and ※temperamental§, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. \nSomeone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are ※going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton§＃ \nOn Syria＊s civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. \nClinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ※safe zones§ on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. \n※What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,§ said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. ※You＊re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.§ \nIn order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. \nAnd in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. \nAccording to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences＃ \nRussia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. \n※I wouldn＊t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,§ Clapper said, speaking with CBS＊ Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. \nOf course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria ※would require us to go to war§ ＃ \n※Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,＃ That＊s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I＊m not going to make.§ ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) \nBut Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. \nYou see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn＊t for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no ※humanitarian crisis§ in Syria at all. \nThanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won＊t have anywhere to hide. \nSo the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. \nOne recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates ＃ \n※Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation 每 at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,§ Putin said. \n※Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,§ Putin noted. \nAnyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. \nAnd even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania ＃ Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America＊s troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. \nIn addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia＃ \nAfter accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. \nA rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. \n※The US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,§ said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen S?reide. \nMost Americans aren＊t aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. \nBut in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation ＃ \nRussian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. \nAt the Kremlin＊s Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. \nThe country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. \nI know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. \nIn my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn＊t know how the election would turn out. \nAt this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. \nIf you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don＊t do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. \nIf the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years. \nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare shares",

    "text": "Well, in a long list of documented lies, coverups and criminal activity , Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah continues to get busted, demonstrating that the man is a pathological liar , which makes him mentally unstable and unfit for office ( not that he was qualified in the first place ). \nFirst, let's review what Obama said. Michael Bastasch reports : \nThe White House knew President Barack Obama had emailed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email account that was run out of an unsecured server in her New York home, according to emails released by WikiLeaks. \nObama told CBS News in March 2015 he learned of Clinton's private server the way basically all Americans did, \" through news reports .\" But emails hacked from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's Gmail account suggest the White House already knew about Clinton's private email server. \n\"They know POTUS and HRC emailed,\" Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri wrote to aides in March 2015 〞 about a month before Clinton announced she was running for president in 2016. \nSo, how did Obama find out about Clinton's illegal email server ? The same way most Americans do, \"through new reports;\" at least that is the lie he told. \nSo, how do we know he's lying? First, his lips are moving. Second, is the documented evidence of a March 7, 2015 email from Josh Schwerin to Jennifer Palmieri, Kristina Schake, Nick Merrill, Jesse Ferguson, which reads, \"Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news.\" \nAnd what was the reply? \n\"we [sic] need to clean this up 每 he has emails from her 每 they do not say state.gov.\" \nThat reply came from none other than Cheryl Mills, who wrote to John Podesta. \nDoes anyone else think Josh had to change his cell phone number after this? \nThis is right along the lines of the lie Obama told when he said, \"If You Like Your Health Care Plan, You Can Keep It\" . \nAnyways, this is what we have come to expect from those who are supposed to serve the people in government, but we should not expect such and should not allow it to continue. Rather, we should be demanding that justice prevail in all things and deal with these people not just by getting them out of government, but by bringing a just punishment on them for what they have done and sending a message to anyone else that chooses to engage in this behavior while in public service that they will receive the same treatment. shares",

    "text": "Print \nThe headlines are in. Trump is the ※anti-Democratic§ candidate because he refuses to rule out challenging the results of an election that has yet to take place. Such a course of action is ※beyond the pale.§ It＊s a threat to democracy. And it is utterly and thoroughly unacceptable. \nExcept when Democrats do it. \nIt was the day after the election. While the Democratic Party faithful waited in the rain in Nashville, William Daley strode out and announced, ※Our campaign continues.§ Al Gore had called George W. Bush to withdraw his concession. ※Are you saying what I think you＊re saying?\" a baffled Bush asked. ※You don＊t have to be snippy about it,\" Gore retorted snippily. \nGore did eventually concede. Though years later he would attempt to retract his concession a second time. But his political movement never did concede. It remained a widespread belief in left-wing circles that President Bush was illegitimately elected and that President Gore was the real winner. \nHow mainstream is that belief? \nWhen Hillary dragged Gore away from playing with his Earth globe to campaign for her, the crowd booed at his mention of the election and then chanted, ※You won, you won.§ \nHillary grinned and nodded. \nHillary Clinton has always believed that President Bush illegitimately took office. She has told Democrats that Bush was ※selected§ rather than ※elected§. In Nigeria, of all places, she implied that Jeb Bush had rigged the election for his brother. \nBut it＊s not unprecedented, beyond the pale or utterly unacceptable when Democrats do it. \nIt＊s just business as usual. \nThe media＊s focus has been on whether Trump would accept the results if he loses. Yet a better question might be whether Hillary Clinton would accept her defeat. \nEven when it came to the battle for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton refused to concede defeat until the bitter end and then past it. Not only did Hillary refuse to drop out even when Obama was the clear winner, while her people threatened a convention floor fight, but she insisted on staying on in the race for increasingly bizarre and even downright disturbing reasons. \nIn South Dakota, Hillary explained that there was no reason for her to drop out because somebody might shoot Barack Obama, \"We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.\" \nThere＊s something disturbing in the revelation that Hillary was basing her decision to stay in the race in the hope that her rival would be assassinated. \nObama＊s spokesman said that her remark ※has no place in this campaign§. But it had a place inside Hillary Clinton＊s very warped brain which preferred to see Obama die than concede the election to him. \nIf that＊s how Hillary felt about a fellow Democrat, imagine how she feels about Trump. \nEven after Obama had clinched the delegate votes, Hillary＊s speech brought back the Gore argument insisting that, ※Nearly 18 million of you cast your votes for our campaign, carrying the popular vote with more votes than any primary candidate in history. Even when the pundits and the naysayers proclaimed week after week that this race was over, you kept on voting.§ \nThen the fabulously wealthy Hillary asked those 18 million people to go to her website and give her money while refusing to make any decision on ending her campaign. It took her another day to do that. \nIt＊s not as if the Obama side was any better. It was arguably worse. Governor Wilder, an Obama ally, threatened a return of the 1968 Chicago Democratic convention riots if Hillary won. \"If you think 1968 was bad, you watch; in 2008, it will be worse,§ Wilder warned. \nUnprecedented. Outrageous. Beyond the pale. Except this is how Democrats act even to each other. \nNow how would they respond to a Trump victory? Would they urge Hillary to concede or to fight on? Would they stage more riots while claiming voter disenfranchisement had stolen the election? \nHillary Clinton has made it clear that she views Trump＊s candidacy as illegitimate. She has called him ※unfit§ and described his supporters as ※deplorables.§ Democrats, all the way up to the White House, are constantly accusing Republicans of scheming to disenfranchise voters. These ※schemes§ involve asking undocumented Democrats to show some ID instead of relying on an honor system and removing illegitimate voters from the rolls. But beyond enabling voter fraud, such arguments can easily be employed to attack the legitimacy of a Republican winner. They provide the fodder for another Florida. \nDoes anyone really believe that Hillary Clinton, who couldn＊t even graciously concede to Obama will graciously concede to Trump? \nAnd, given the fact that Hillary won the nomination by using the DNC to rig the process, leading to the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz , are Trump＊s concerns of a rigged election illegitimate? \nDonald Trump has clarified that he would accept ※a clear election result§ but that he was ※being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters.§ \nAnd he＊s right. No one preemptively cedes elections. And Hillary Clinton has faced accusations of abusive and fraudulent tactics from Democratic rivals in two different presidential elections. \nWhy should Republicans assume that she＊ll treat them better than she treated Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders? \nNot all that long ago, the left wanted Gore to fight to the bitter end. A Gore adviser recalled, \"People were calling us from everywhere, telling us, 'Don't concede.'\" Left-wing voices urged Bernie Sanders to stay in the race long after it became obvious that the left-winger had no realistic path to victory left. \nBut the same behavior that is virtuous when Democrats do it becomes an unpardonable sin when Republicans take it up. \nThat＊s a pernicious double standard that cannot and should not be allowed to stand. \nWhen Democrats warn of voter disenfranchisement, the media backs them up. When Republicans complain about voter fraud, they are accused of voter suppression. When Democrats fight elections past the point that they＊re lost, then they are courageous. But when Republicans do it, they are a threat to democracy. \nBut democracy does not mean Democratic Party rule. That＊s just the mistake that the media makes. \nWhatever rules we have, run both ways. Any practices, new or old, also apply to both sides. If challenging election results is legitimate, then it is so for both sides. Whatever options were available to Gore and Hillary cannot help but be available to Trump. \nThat is how democracy, rather than Democratic Party rule, works. \nArticle reposted with permission from Sultan Knish shares",

    "text": "Print \nThe bombshells about this criminal are now breaking daily. It＊s not a question of Trump, it is an imperative that Hillary be defeated. If the people choose Hillary, then they must and will be punished. \n※Wikileaks: Bill Clinton Boasts of Hillary＊s ＆Working Relationship＊ with Muslim Brotherhood,§ By John Hayward , Breitbart, October 26, 2016: \nIn a speech Bill Clinton gave at the home of Mehul and Hema Sanghani in October 2015, revealed to the public for the first time by WikiLeaks, former President Bill Clinton touted Hillary Clinton＊s ※working relationship§ with the Muslim Brotherhood ＊s Mohamed Morsi in Egypt as an example of her diplomatic skills.President Clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the Iran nuclear deal, in a passage that began with the standard Democrat ※stuff happens§ shrugging defense for foreign policy failures: \nFinally, we live in a world, as I said, that＊s full of good news and bad news. The United States cannot control it all, but we need a president who＊s most likely to make as many good things happen as possible, and most likely to prevent big, bad things from happening. You can＊t keep every bad thing from happening; who＊s most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way. Even the people who don＊t like the Iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadn＊t been for the sanctions. Hillary negotiated those sanctions and got China and Russia to sign off 每 something I thought she＊d never be able to do. I confess. I＊m never surprised by anything she does, but that surprised me. I didn＊t think she could do it. The Chinese and the Russians to see past their short-term self-interest to their long-term interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race. \nAnd when the Muslim Brotherhood took over in Egypt, in spite of the fact that we were (inaudible), she developed a working relationship with the then-president and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a full-scale shooting war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which on top of what was going on in Syria and the (inaudible) Jordan would have been a calamity for the world. \nAnd when we were trying to reset our relations with Russia under President Medvedev, she and her team negotiated a New START Treaty, which limits warheads and missiles. And she lobbied it through the Senate. She had to get 67 votes, which means a lot of these Republicans who say that they don＊t like her now are just kidding for election season. They trusted her, and she got it passed. You can＊t get 67 votes in the Senate without a lot of Republican support. And I don＊t know about you, but with all this tension and Mr. Putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in Syria, I think it＊s a very good thing that we＊re in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the Russians. She did that. \nYou＊ll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the Iran debacle than Bill Clinton boasting that the sanctions Barack Obama lifted were super-awesome, as even those who don＊t think those sanctions should have been lifted agree. \nMr. Clinton＊s version of the Iran sanctions leaves out a few details , such as Russia＊s keen financial interest in keeping Iranian energy out of the European market, and China＊s desire to use Iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip. \nBut the part about the Muslim Brotherhood is most interesting. If anything, he is selling Hillary Clinton＊s ※working relationship§ with Egyptian Islamists short, because she used American diplomatic leverage for Morsi＊s benefit even before he got elected, warning Egyptians about ※backtracking§ to a military regime at a key moment of the post-Mubarak campaign, when Morsi was running against a former member of Hosni Mubarak＊s military. There have long been rumors that more subtle forms of U.S. ※ pressure § were used to secure Morsi＊s office, as well. \nThen again, in public pronouncements, Clinton called Hosni Mubarak＊s tottering regime ※stable§ and cautioned her Obama Administration colleagues against ※pushing a longtime partner out the door.§ \nA few days ago, declassified State Department documents revealed Clinton＊s talking points for a 2012 meeting with Morsi hailed his election as a ※milestone in Egypt＊s transition to democracy,§ and stated that she was to offer the Muslim Brotherhood leader ※technical expertise and assistance from both the U.S. government and private sector to support his economic and social programs.§ \nClinton was also supposed to privately offer Morsi assistance with his police and security forces, which would be conducted ※quite discreetly.§ \nAfter Morsi was gone, she declared herself exasperated with Egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical ※realist.§ That is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the Obama Administration was saying while the ※Arab Spring§ was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but America-aligned (or at least America-fearing) regimes, which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long. \nAs for Clinton＊s superb working relationship with Morsi, that eventually ended with Morsi＊s wife railing against Clinton for supposedly dismissing him as ※a simpleton who was unfit for the presidency,§ and threatening to publish letters from Clinton to Morsi that would damage the former U.S. Secretary of State. Meanwhile, Mohammed Morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the Egyptian penitentiary system . \nEgypt has one of those icky military governments again, and while it won＊t have fond memories of Hillary Clinton＊s support for the Muslim Brotherhood regime, it will most likely work with whoever wins the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Therefore, a prospective President Hillary Clinton probably won＊t suffer too much from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton＊s appalling lapses in judgment. \nArticle reposted with permission from PamelaGeller.com",

    "title": "Re: Apostate Evangelicals Are Poised To Become The Deciding Factor In A Hillary Clinton Election Victory",
    "text": "Print \nIf you look at the numbers, there is no way that Hillary Clinton could possibly win the election without the support of a substantial percentage of evangelical Christian voters. In fact, if evangelical Christians stuck together they could pretty much elect whoever they want as president. According to the Pew Research Center, 35 percent of all adults in the United States identify themselves as ※evangelical§ or ※born again§, and it has been estimated that there are 94 million evangelical Christian adults in this country. If evangelical Christians acted as a single voting block they could determine the outcome of every single presidential election. Unfortunately, that simply is not going to happen. \nA survey that was recently conducted by LifeWay Research found that only 45 percent of Christian evangelicals plan to vote for Donald Trump and 31 percent of Christian evangelicals plan to vote for Hillary Clinton. \nThat same survey discovered that moral issues are becoming increasingly unimportant to evangelical voters＃ Overall, the economy is the top concern for Americans regardless of religious affiliation (30%). National security (17%) and personal character (17%) also are significant issues. Supreme Court nominees (10%), immigration (5%), religious freedom (2%), and abortion (1%) are less important . ※For churchgoers and those with evangelical beliefs, their pocketbook and personal safety are paramount,§ said McConnell. ※Moral issues aren＊t a priority for many of them.§ \nI don＊t know how in the world abortion could come in at only 1 percent. Even if you add ※Supreme Court nominees§ and abortion together, you still only get a total of 11 percent. \nThis just shows that evangelicals in America have their priorities way out of order. \nAnd unfortunately for Donald Trump, he is getting a lot less support from evangelicals than other recent presidential candidates received. According to the New York Times , previous candidates have generally received about 80 percent support from white evangelical voters, but Donald Trump is only getting about 65 to 70 percent support, and his numbers among non-white evangelicals are absolutely dismal. \nIf you are an evangelical Christian and you have reservations about Donald Trump, I can respect that. But there will be other names on the ballot and you do not have to vote for Hillary Clinton. As I have said before, a vote for Hillary Clinton is an act of unmitigated wickedness. \nHillary Clinton has made support for abortion one of the central pillars of her long political career. In fact, I don＊t know if there is any politician in America that is more associated with abortion than Hillary Clinton. Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, more than 58 million babies have been murdered in the United States, and Hillary Clinton＊s hands are drenched with their blood. \nIf you vote for Hillary Clinton, your hands will be drenched with their blood too. \nNeedless to say, I am absolutely horrified that so many prominent evangelical leaders have come out in support of Hillary Clinton during this election season. For example, a group that represents over 6,000 Latino evangelical churches has just announced that they are endorsing Hillary Clinton ＃ \nAn organization representing more than 6,000 Latino evangelical churches in the U.S. is endorsing Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. \nIn a statement Thursday, the group OPEN USA says Clinton has proven her willingness to engage in difficult conversations, listen to contrasting opinions and engage faith leaders. \nMeanwhile, 75 evangelical leaders recently signed a petition on Change.org that strongly denounces Donald Trump＃ \nWe, undersigned evangelicals, simply will not tolerate the racial, religious, and gender bigotry that Donald Trump has consistently and deliberately fueled, no matter how else we choose to vote or not to vote. \nOne of the truly alarming trends that we have been seeing this election season is the number of prominent women in the evangelical movement that are openly rejecting Donald Trump and embracing Hillary Clinton. The following is a short excerpt from a recent Washington Post article that examined this phenomenon＃ \nWhen Jen Hatmaker speaks to stadiums full of Christian women, she regales them with stories about her five children and her garden back in Austin, Tex. 〞 and stays away from politics. But recently she took to Facebook and Instagram to blast Donald J. Trump as a ※national disgrace,§ and remind her legions of followers that there are other names on the ballot in November. \nAnd Christianity Today recently published an editorial from one of the top female evangelical leaders in the entire country in which she publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton. According to Christianity Today, Deborah Fikes is ※the former Permanent Representative to the United Nations for World Evangelical Alliance, which represents a constituency of 650 million with alliance offices in 129 countries.§ Fikes says that she stepped down from some of her leadership positions so that she could openly advocate for Clinton ＃ My recent resignations from evangelical leadership positions to endorse Hillary Clinton speaks volumes of how important I believe it is that she is elected in November. The toxic tone and atmosphere that surrounds Mr. Trump and is fueled among his supporters has done irreparable damage to not only our country and the future of the GOP but also to the public witness of evangelicals in America who are seen as some of his biggest supporters. There is no question in my mind or spirit that with the overwhelming challenges the next American president will face, Hillary Clinton is the most qualified person who has ever run for the Oval Office . On the issues of our national security, economic stability, seeing that healthcare reform continues to move forward, and tackling domestic challenges of poverty, inequality, and racism, we need her to be the person occupying this office. \nA lot of these women seem to think that abortion shouldn＊t be a major issue in this election, but that is like saying that the Holocaust shouldn＊t have been a major issue in Nazi Germany. \nLook, you don＊t have to vote for Donald Trump or anyone else to be a good Christian. \nBut if you cast a vote for Hillary Clinton, you are casting a vote for the most evil, wicked and corrupt politician that this nation has possibly ever seen, and you are publicly endorsing the sinful positions that she is proud to stand for. \nI know that I have been writing about the election a lot lately , but I feel that it is very important that I do so. Most of the media coverage has focused on Donald Trump , but I feel that this election is far more about Hillary Clinton. The things that her and her husband have done have been well documented, and if the American people willingly choose her they will know exactly what they are doing. \nUnfortunately, not even Christians are standing united against the Clintons. The political divide in the evangelical Christian world has grown so deep that it has even reached Liberty University. The following comes from the Atlantic ＃ \nThat＊s why it was such a big deal when, two weeks ago, a group of Liberty students put out a letter explaining why they＊re standing against the Republican presidential nominee. Jerry Falwell Jr., who has run the school since his father died in 2007, announced his support for Donald Trump back in January, and he has since spoken on the candidate＊s behalf in interviews and at events. ※We are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell＊s endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history,§ the students wrote. ※Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him.§ \nThousands of people signed onto the letter, including, the students said, roughly 2,000 students or alumni with liberty.edu email addresses.Dustin Wahl and Alex Forbes, two of the letter＊s authors, were featured on MSNBC and CNN. They said they received supportive emails and tweets from Russell Moore, the head of the political arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, and Erick Erickson, the conservative radio-show host. \nAnd the support for Clinton is particularly strong among young adult evangelicals. When I read the following paragraph on the website of the New York Times , I was absolutely astounded＃ \nKate Shellnutt, 30, the online editor of Christianity Today and editor of the CT Women section, said she had observed that ※the millennial generation has a lot less patience for Trump.§ Of the 33 influential millennial evangelicals she profiled for a cover story two years ago, she says she can now find only one, Lila Rose, who is pro-Trump, and even she has been publicly critical of him . Several have been using the hashtag #NeverTrump, Ms. Shellnutt said. \nThe frightening thing is that this election might be the last chance for evangelical Christians to shape the political direction of this nation, because the truth is that demographics are rapidly shifting, and this includes the demographics of the evangelical community ＃ \nAs Robert Jones has expertly documented in his recent book The End of White Christian America , the number of older, conservative, white male evangelicals is shrinking each year. Meanwhile, the number of younger evangelicals of all ethnic backgrounds 〞 whose moral and political views extend far beyond positions on gay marriage and abortion 〞 is on the rise. \nIf you follow my work regularly, then you already know that I have very little hope for the future of America. \nBut if Hillary Clinton is elected, there will be exactly zero hope. \nIf evangelical Christians stood united, they could stop her, but at this point it appears that is not going to happen. \nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare shares",

    "text": "Truth Bomb from Rasmussen: More Americans Want Hilary Indicted Than Elected! \nAnd the list goes on＃(Proverbs 24:21; Hebrews 4:13) \nNow Hillary and the foreign agent in the people＊s White House, Barack Hussein Obama, are being exposed for voter rigging . Obama has been visited 45 times out of his 340 visits to the White House by election rigging guru and former prison inmate Robert Creamer . \nThe new scapegoat for Obama and Clinton is Russia. They are now being blamed for the crime when it is Clinton and Obama who are literally exposed in their own corruptions. \nAmerica, do not be diverted from these diplomatic magicians from hell (John 8:44-45). The Clintons have been selling uranium ore to the Russians . This is now World Wrestling Entertainment on a global scale, as they continue to play off of each other. They are not archenemies. They are allied in crime together, period. \nFurthermore, like that of the Bushes, China, Russia and America, as well as the Pope, they are all calling for the new world. They are allied with the covenant of Hell, which I remind you disannulled (Isaiah 28:15-18). \nMany are wondering why Hillary Clinton is even up on the platform during debates. It comes to this, the American people have been soft on these corrupt criminals, and have been soft on themselves. However, God will not be soft (Nahum 1:3), and these corrupt individuals have been encouraged to act out in a more corrupt manner. \nAmericans have also allowed the appeasers that identify themselves as prosecutors and government oversight to talk big . Yet, they produce nothing when it comes to justice (Amos 5:7). They are the fox in the chicken coop, acting as if they actually mean what they say. They are protecting themselves as much as the establishment in which they are a part. \nThen there are those who pose as some sort of patriotic representatives when, in fact, they are the same people that have given Barack a pass every step of the way. These are a few of those who are the establishment: Colin Powell",

    "text": "Email \nWho would have thought right? Hillary＊s campaign establishing what appears to be some very close ties with the largest social media company (Facebook) on the Internet, right in the midst of her presidential campaign? It＊s not enough that Hillary has Google hiding various stories from Clinton search queries, but it looks like she had to go and get Facebook on board to help her cheat as well. But should Trump supporters take any issue with that? \nSure, there＊s been issues in the past with Facebook banning conservatives for merely looking at their monitors the wrong way, but all that changed this week right? If you recall, earlier this week we learned that despite donating huge amounts of money to Hillary＊s campaign, allegedly Mark Zuckerberg betrayed Hillary Clinton, and actually jumped on board the Trump Train ＃ or is there more to this? In the video below I dig a bit deeper into both these stories＃ \nEmails Show Connection Between Facebook Executive, Clinton Campaign \n＃ kept the interactions with Clinton private ＃ \nA new WikiLeaks email dump shows Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg eager and willing to be involved in helping Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton＊s campaign. \nSandberg＊s role in helping the research-driven Clinton campaign was revealed in a WikiLeaks email from Clinton aide Cheryl Mills. \n※I have arranged for Sheryl Sandberg and her researcher to be available on 5 March at 10 am to step through the research on gender and leadership by women,§ Mills wrote in a February 2015 email. \nTwo months after that meeting, Sandberg offered to do more for the campaign in response to an email from campaign chairman John Podesta expressing sympathy for the death of her husband. \n※I still want HRC to win badly ,§ Sandberg wrote in May 2015. ※I am still here to help as I can. She came over and was magical with my kids.§ \nFacebook has said that Sandberg was acting in a private capacity in sharing research with the Clinton campaign. Sandberg kept the interactions with Clinton private, and did not formally, publicly endorse Clinton until early 2016. \nHowever, she kept in touch with the campaign. In August 2015, she emailed Podesta offering to put him in touch with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , a staunch opponent of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump . \n※Mark is meeting with people to learn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action and it＊s hard to imagine someone better placed or more experienced than you to help him,§ she wrote. \n※He＊s begun to think about whether/how he might want to shape advocacy efforts to support his philanthropic priorities and is particularly interested in meeting people who could help him understand how to move the needle on the specific public policy issues he cares most about,§ she added. \n※He wants to meet folks who can inform his understanding about effective political operations to advance public policy goals on social oriented objectives (like immigration, education or basic scientific research),§ she wrote. \nThe WikiLeaks emails from Podesta＊s account imply a meeting was arranged later that month. \nSOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS ARE ACTUALLY GOVERNMENT CREATIONS: \nIf you doubt that the CIA made Google, and Google made the NSA, but you don＊t read the following: save your worthless drivel for someone who cares.

    "title": "Leaked Audio: Hillary Clinton Pushed ※Rigging§ Palestine Elections in 2006",
    "text": "Email \nA bombshell of new audio is exposing Hillary Clinton for the immoral, politically motivated opportunist that she is. Now the question is, will this impact her race for the White House? \nSome ten years ago (more recent than Donald Trump＊s now infamous ※locker room talk§ recording) in September of 2006, Hillary Clinton was running for reelection to the Senate when she sat down to speak with the editorial board of the Jewish Press. The sit-down was recorded, but the full conversation had never been released, until now. One of the editors present during the interview spoke with the Observer this week and played them the 45-minute long tape of the conversation with Clinton. \nBelow is what is likely the most important disclosure of the conversation, and it provides reason for American voters to worry. It also proves that Donald Trump is not some crazy conspiracy theorist for expressing concern about the Democrat Party trying to ※rig§ the 2016 election. \nWhile talking to the Jewish Press, Clinton commented on the 2006 election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (where terrorist organization Hamas won control of the Palestinian government) and expressed her belief that allowing the election was a huge mistake, but if they were going to allow it＃ then the US government should have rigged the election to suit their needs. \n※I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.§ \nYes, you just heard correctly. A sitting US Senator, and the future Secretary of State and then presidential candidate just argued that we should have rigged the election, thereby disallowing the right of the Palestinian people to choose their own leaders. \nWhile Hamas is a terrorist organization and they are horrible, murderous thugs whose ideology we must stamp out＃ the comments should raise this question in our minds 每 if Hillary Clinton is willing to rig an election in Palestine, why wouldn＊t she do the same here if she could? This realization that Clinton is not beyond ※fixing§ the results of an election, should make all of the other recent evidences of massive voter fraud all the more concerning. \nWell known election fraud expert John Fund has written article , after article , after article and even books chronicling voter fraud in the U.S. \nFund wrote extensively, for instance, of the 2008 election that put Al Franken in the U.S. Senate for the State of Minnesota. The 312-vote victory Franken eked out, Fund wrote , was not a happy result of just enough votes but a result born of massive vote fraud. \nOther reporters have written of vote fraud, of course. Take the report in the Washington Free Beacon that revealed that 141 U.S. counties have more people registered to vote than they even have residents eligible to do so! \nThese charges have been building for at least 20 years and over the last few months they have shifted into high gear. But we don＊t have to stick to recent history to find people complaining about voter fraud. Only eight years ago when he was first running for the White House, even Barack Obama was heard complaining about rampant vote fraud in the U.S＃ \nAnd then there is the new series of undercover videos by Jame O＊Keefe＊s Project Veritas which has revealed Democrat operatives admitting that they routinely engage in voter fraud in order to win elections by hook or crook. \nPlease make sure to read the full Observer story about the 2006 interview with Hillary Clinton. There are a few other remarkable observations made about some of Clinton＊s comments 每 like her willingness to speak with world leaders no matter the current political climate between our countries and Clinton＊s seeming approval of ※an eye for an eye§ interactions between Israel and Hamas. \nArticle reposted with permission from Constitution.com",

    "title": "Will Barack Obama Delay Or Suspend The Election If Hillary Is Forced Out By The New FBI Email Investigation?",
    "text": "Email \nJust when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton＊s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails ※did not come from her private server§, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the ※emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry§, and according to some reports there may be ※potentially thousands§ of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? \nLet＊s take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ \nAfter recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ※appear to be pertinent§ to the email probe. \n※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,§ Comey wrote the chairmen. ※I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.§ \nAt this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton＊s closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton＊s Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ \nWe don＊t know what this means yet except that it＊s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that＊s where we are＃ \nIs it a certainty that we won＊t learn before the election? I＊m not sure it＊s a certainty we won＊t learn before the election. \nOne thing is, it＊s possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ \nIf the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? \nIt is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. \nSo those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. \nBut if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year＊s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group＊s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nIt would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. \nIn such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be ※fair§ until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. \nMeanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. \nAnd CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ \nAn artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. \nMogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. \nThe AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. \nWithout Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. \nSo if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. \nAt this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen. \nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare",

    "title": "The Deceptive Nature of Hillary Clinton is Right in Line with Communism",
    "text": "Email \nMuch to the surprise of the American electorate, both on the right and left, the FBI is reopening it's investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal. Whether this will amount to anything meaningful, or it is simply a distraction is any body's guess. Many are speculating that this could be the issue which would cause President Obama to cancel the elections. In my recent article \"Corrupting One's Self is the Ultimate Morality in the Pursuit of Utopia,\" I discussed the possibility that the blatant corruption is deliberately being thrust in our face to create the necessary attitude for social change. This idea of course, is based on the writings of Alinsky and other \"social engineers\" skilled in the arts of propaganda and psychological manipulation. Looking at it from this perspective, cancelled elections are a possibility. The truth is, with Hillary Clinton you never know what to expect because she is operating from an \"ends justify the means mentality,\" and she is willing to do anything to see her dreams of a collectivized America move forward. \nAccording to Elizabeth Harrington from the Washington Free Beacon, the Clinton campaign began conducting focus groups to determine which approach Hillary should take concerning her run for the presidency. Hillary is diehard ideologue whose beliefs are right in line with Communists dictators like Stalin and Mao. She believes that ordinary people have no idea how to best conduct their personal business and the state should be involved in every aspect of our lives. The goal of these focus groups was to determine the attitudes of the electorate in order to mold her message and her personality into something they would vote for. Many people would attempt to ridicule and discredit anyone associating Hillary Clinton with communists because she comes across as compassionate and caring, always blaming everything on a vast, right wing conspiracy. \nThis has always been the modus operandi of the communist movement and it explains why so many young people have no idea about the atrocities committed under the regimes of communist rulers. Today's millennials are well aware of the holocaust and the millions of Jews murdered by Adolph Hitler. They may not however, know that Hitler murdered more than Jews. He started by eliminating the sick and disabled, then he murdered Christians, homosexuals and anyone else essentially, that didn't go along with his national socialism. The belief is that fascism is an extreme right wing world view. This explains the hostility towards today's conservative movement. They have been branded as fascists, when in fact, the truth is the exact opposite. On the true political scale, national socialism or fascism is to the right of communism, which represents complete state control, but it is still way left of center. A true, extreme right wing world view would be complete absence of government control over anything. With this being said, and understanding that the horrors of communism have all been forgotten simply because they are no longer being taught, the communists have been very successful in deceiving people because like Hillary Clinton, they pretend to be something they are not. \nMillions of young people in America, due to left wing indoctrination in our universities, are falling for the communist propaganda under the guise that communism is a more fair, compassionate system of economics. Left wing professors, refusing to acknowledge the failures of communism because they believe the right leader has not come along to implement it the right way, have failed to teach these young minds that the pursuit of total equality has led to the death of 100,000,000 people under communist controlled governments. Communists, believing not in God but in evolution and science, believe that man can be trained into submission and a refusal to accept communist ideals is in fact, a sign of mental deficiency. Therefore, it is justifiable to eliminate them. To understand this read \"Brainwashing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics.\" Communists also hide this belief by claiming their pursuit of equality is motivated by a pursuit of social and economic justice when in fact, it is motivated by a pure desire to control every aspect of human being. \nThe Black Book of Communism references the historical debate over the evil natures of both Communism and Nazism. Adolf Hitler, despite his cruelty was open about what his intentions were. He set out to create a perfect race that understood its role was to serve the state and nothing else. This isn't any different than the goals of communism truthfully, only insofar as communists seek to accomplish this on a global scale, (using the economic class issue as opposed to race) while national socialism focuses on achieving such a goal for the country itself. The communists on the other hand, as mentioned above, pretended to be compassionate about the poor and oppressed when in reality- they use these groups to organize for power while hiding behind the guise of compassion and the struggle to achieve social justice, while in reality-they are systematically imprisoning and murdering all that don't go along with their agenda. This, according to the Black Book of Communism, makes the communist ideology, if you could really assign degrees of evil, more evil than Nazism because of its deceptive nature. \nWe all know Hillary Clinton is a liar, and she wrote her college thesis on Saul Alinsky but do we know anything else about her? Given the fact that she conducted focus groups to help mold her campaign message it is obvious she is hiding something. Over the past several weeks we have seen references to leaked emails which show she has an obvious disdain for the average American and the common beliefs in liberty that most of us share. She has referred to many of us as \"irredeemable deplorables\" in an effort to brand us as the uncompassionate ones while pretending to care about the poor and so called oppressed. In fact, this is the whole strategy of the Democrat party because as we all know, they have taken a hard turn left and do not represent the views of most Americans. They will however, pretend to in order to get in office. What are her intentions if she were to assume office? Are the massive dehumanization campaigns where conservatives are labeled as fascists and whites as automatic racists a first step to a repeat of history where millions were slaughtered because they were deemed as undesirable by their own government? Looking at the deceptive nature of Hillary Clinton and the violent nature of the left, it sure seems like a distinct possibility. \nThe number of deaths under communist regimes from the Black Book of Communism Soviet Union- Vladimr Lenin and Joseph Stalin-20 million deaths China-Mao- 65 million deaths Vietnam- Ho Chi Mihn- 1 million deaths North Korea- 2 million deaths Cambodia- Pol Pot- 2 million deaths Eastern Europe- 1 million deaths Latin America- 150,000 deaths Africa- 1.7 million deaths Afghanistan (under soviet control) 1.5 million deaths \nThese are not deaths represented by wartime or revolutions, but by outright murder committed by evil men intent on creating perfect societies based on social justice and equality. I guess the question remains. Is man capable of bringing about a perfect society? \nArticle posted with permission from In Defense of Our Nation",

    "text": "Email \nDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton responded to the latest bombshell about her emails by demanding FBI director James Comey immediately release everything the FBI has discovered. \nShe also falsely accused Comey of only sending the letters to Republicans, suggesting he was causing a political firestorm by doing so. Clinton held a brief four-minute press conference with reporters in Iowa Friday, where she has been campaigning. \n※I have now seen Director Comey＊s letter to Congress,§ Clinton said to open her remarks. ※We are 11 days out from perhaps the most important national election in our lifetimes ＃ so the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately.§ https://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews/status/792142514471907329 \n※The director himself has said he doesn＊t know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not,§ she continued. ※I＊m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July. Therefore it＊s imperative that the Bureau explain this issue and question, whatever it is, without any delay.§ \nClinton said the recent announcement from Comey came as a complete surprise to her and her staff, and that she only learned about it thanks to ※this letter sent to Republican members of the House.§ \nWhile Clinton＊s rhetoric implies that Comey only contacted Republicans, that＊s not the case. While only Republicans are listed at the top of Comey＊s letter (because they hold all House committee chairmanships) Comey＊s letter was also copied to the Democratic ranking members of each committee. \nClinton also dismissed as a ※rumor§ reports that the email investigation was reopened due to discoveries made during a separate investigation of former Democratic representative Anthony Weiner. Weiner is the husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, though she announced her separation from him following revelations last month that Weiner sexted with an underage girl.

    "title": "Will Michelle Obama Be The Replacement Nominee If The FBI Email Investigation Ends Hillary Clinton＊s Campaign?",
    "text": "Email \nI realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre, but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen. We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. \nIn fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled ※ Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside ※＃ \nSo what should the Democrats do now? \nIf ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: \nThey would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. \nDemocrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. \nBut what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year＊s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group＊s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nSo if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. \nWho would they choose? \nLet＊s take a look at the top five options＃ \n#1 Tim Kaine \nHe would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton＊s running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. \nAnd at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. \nSo to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. \n#2 Joe Biden \nVice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run ＃ \nVice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. \nBiden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton＊s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. \nBut according to the vice president, the short answer is ※no.§ The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. \nUnfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. \nBiden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn＊t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. \nBiden would probably represent the ※safest§ choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. \n#3 Bernie Sanders \nBernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. \nFirst of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. \nSecondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. \nThirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be ※another McGovern§ and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. \nSo even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. \n#4 Elizabeth Warren \nElizabeth Warren would be very popular with the ※Bernie Sanders§ wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. \nSo she is definitely a possibility. \nBut she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as ※another McGovern§ because of her far left policies. \n#5 Michelle Obama \nOne recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. \nAnd these days Barack Obama＊s approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. \nSo the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. \nMichelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as ※the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign§ in a recent MSN article entitled ※ In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice ※＃ \nThe speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama＊s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. \n※When you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,§ said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. ※We know she didn＊t like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.§ \nIf I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. \nOf course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. \nAnd I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. \nIn the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. \nAnd if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down. \nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare Don't forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter .

    "title": "If Hillary Clinton Is Charged With Obstruction Of Justice She Could Go To Prison For 20 Years",
    "text": "Email \nIn the world of politics, the cover-up is often worse than the original crime. It was his role in the Watergate cover-up that took down Richard Nixon, and now Hillary Clinton＊s cover-up of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very, very long time. When news broke that the FBI has renewed its investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s emails, it sent shockwaves throughout the political world . But this time around, we aren＊t just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents. I haven＊t heard anyone talking about this, but if the FBI discovers that Hillary Clinton altered, destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the FBI during the original investigation, she could be charged with obstruction of justice. That would immediately end her political career, and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life. \nI have not seen a single news report mention the phrase ※obstruction of justice§ yet, but I am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading. The following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice ＃ \nWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. \nIf Hillary Clinton is sent to prison for 20 years, that would essentially be for the rest of her life. \nI have a feeling that the FBI is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in Huma Abedin＊s emails. But unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before November 8th, because according to the Wall Street Journal there are approximately 650,000 emails to search through＃ \nAs federal agents prepare to scour roughly 650,000 emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of Hillary Clinton ＊s email use, the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the Justice Department over how to investigate the Democratic presidential nominee. \nMetadata found on the laptop used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide, suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that Mrs. Clinton used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter. It will take weeks, at a minimum, to determine whether those messages are work-related from the time Ms. Abedin served with Mrs. Clinton at the State Department; how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the Clinton email probe. \nOf those 650,000 emails, an inside source told Fox News that ※ at least 10,000 § would be of interest to the investigation. \nAt this point, FBI officials have not even begun searching through the emails, because a search warrant has not been secured yet. The following comes from CNN ＃ \nGovernment lawyers haven＊t yet approached Abedin＊s lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search. Sources earlier told CNN that those discussions had begun, but the law enforcement officials now say they have not. \nEither way, government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer, the law enforcement officials said. \nBut the FBI is reportedly already searching a laptop that was co-owned by Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin, and no warrant was necessary for that search because Weiner is cooperating with the FBI. \nMany have been wondering why FBI Director James Comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day. Surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election, and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big. In addition, Comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the FBI. The following is an excerpt from a Daily Mail article that was written by Ed Klein, the author of a recently released New York Times bestseller about the Clintons entitled ※ Guilty As Sin ※＃ \n＆The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn＊t recommend an indictment against Hillary,＊ said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. \n＆Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,＊ said the source. ＆They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.＊ \nAccording to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. \nHe told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. \nSo what happens next? \nIn the most likely scenario, the FBI will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton before the election. This means that we would go into November 8th with this scandal hanging over the Clinton campaign, and that would seem to be very good news for Donald Trump. \nHowever, it is possible that once the FBI starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against Clinton are warranted, and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day. \nIn the unlikely event that does happen, we could actually see Hillary Clinton forced out of the race before November 8th. \nOnce again, this appears to be very unlikely at this point, but it is still possible. \nIf Clinton was forced to step aside, the Democrats would need to come up with a new nominee, and that process would take time. In an article later today on The Most Important News I will reveal who I believe that nominee would be. \nIn such a scenario, the Democrats would desperately need time to get their act together, and so we could actually see Barack Obama attempt to delay or suspend the election . The legality of such a move is highly questionable, but Barack Obama has not allowed a little thing like the U.S. Constitution to stop him in the past. \nThis week is going to be exceedingly interesting 每 that is for sure. \nThe craziest election in modern American history just keeps getting crazier, and I have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead. \nIt sure seems ironic that Anthony Weiner is playing such a central role this late in the story, and I can＊t wait to see what is in store for the season finale. \nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare Don't forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter .

When emails were leaked, Clinton＊s campaign manager sent an email to John Podesta suggest not that they admit the truth and repent, but attempt to deceive the American people further by putting out their own leaks as a decoy. \nThe Daily Caller reports: \nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton＊s presidential campaign manager wanted to leak an announcement 〞 presumably officially announcing her presidential candidacy 〞 as a ※decoy§ after the New York Times first reported her email scandal in March 2015. \n※I think we should get a credible leak out that we＊re announcing on the 20th. As a decoy,§ campaign manager Robby Mook told Clinton adviser John Podesta in a March 12, 2015, email 10 days after the New York Times story broke. The email was made public Monday by Wikileaks. \nCompleting this poll entitles you to Daily Caller news updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.Podesta didn＊t respond to the email thread and Clinton＊s campaign didn＊t officially announce her candidacy until April 12, 2015. \nClinton＊s use of private email addresses and a homebrew server located in her New York mansion to conduct official Department of State business and communicate classified information continues to plague her candidacy, with less than one week before the presidential election. \nWhat are some of these decoys? Several have shown up at the Baltimore Gazette . Then there is this from Reuters. \nIsn＊t this just the way Communists operate in putting out their propaganda? I mean we expect it in Communist countries, but this is just outright deception by the Clinton campaign. If you want to know what you would see in a Clinton White House, just recall the lies of Bill Clinton . Then, combine those with the lies of Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah and you might get close to the amount of lies you will be told daily from Hillary Clinton and her administration.",

    "text": "Email \nBarack Obama and Hillary Clinton are standing on a street corner waiting for a bus. As the bus approaches, Obama grabs Hillary and tosses her out on to the street, where she is then run over by the oncoming bus. \nOf course, this would never happen 每 literally. Neither Obama nor Clinton would ever be caught dead on a bus. Under it, yes - but not in one. \nNaturally, I＊m kidding about Barack tossing Hillary under the bus. He has not the strength to do so. Again 每 kidding. These are the jokes. I＊m here all night. \nBut seriously 每 it does appear that Obama has figuratively thrown her highness under the bus, again, for her ever-growing email scandal. I say again, for this isn＊t the first time the president has done so. \nIn 2015, when asked about Hillary＊s private server, Obama stated , ※The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the Blackberry I carry around, all those records are available and archived.§ Translation 每 I don＊t know what she has been doing, but I follow the law. \nMy buddy Tim Brown at Freedom Outpost reported that both Obama and Biden, prior to the 2012 election, threw Hillary under the bus over the Benghazi scandal. Both men claimed they had no knowledge that those in Benghazi requested more security prior to the attack. Biden stated during a Vice Presidential debate that year that, ※We [Biden and Obama] weren＊t told they wanted more security. We did not know they wanted more security there,§ effectively hanging it on Hillary. \nIt＊s common knowledge of the disdain the Obamas have for the Clintons, and vice versa. As far out radical as Obama is, I don＊t think he＊s a crook 每 or if he is, he is better at hiding it. Obama doesn＊t appear to have sold the White House to highest bidder the way Hillary did at State 每 or selling naked options on her potential to become president. \nAt this point, it seems Barack is probably tiring of constantly having to defend a woman he really can＊t stand, which is why, in my estimation, he is once again hanging her out to dry. \nJust yesterday, White House spokes-punk Josh Earnest said that the White House stood by FBI Director James Comey on Monday as a man of 'integrity' and 'principle' in the face of a Democrat-led assault on his character and intentions. This is a major blow to Clinton 每 one I＊m sure she is furious over. \nThe Daily Mail reports Earnest stated at a daily briefing that, ※The president＊s assessment of his [Comey] integrity and his character has not changed. The president doesn＊t believe he＊s secretly strategizing to benefit one candidate or one political party.§ This, despite attacks on Comey＊s character by Clinton, her surrogates, and now ※Dirty§ Harry Reid. \nIn a rather surprising turn, Earnest even defended President George W. Bush for his selection of Comey. This is highly unusual, as it is this White House＊s historic M.O. to blame Bush for literally everything. \nI don＊t know why the White House seems to be separating itself from the Clinton camp. If I had to guess, beyond the hatred factor, I＊d say that Obama has calculated that, at this point, his legacy is far more important than a president Hillary, and he does not wish to be forever connected to the scandal-ridden candidate. It＊s probably a fair calculation. That, and maybe by favoring Comey in this war, he might himself purchase some good will to keep his involvement under wraps.

    "title": "Secret Emails From Hillary Clinton Reveal: There Is A Very Powerful Circle Of People Ruling Over Hillary Who Hate Christians And Who Are Now Executing A Plan To Annihilate Christians And Advance Islam - Freedom Outpost",
    "text": "Email \nReading through Hillary and her ＆gang＊ leaked emails, gives us a picture as to how America＊s foreign policy was run, a policy that nearly wiped out Christians from the Middle East. Looking through Hillary＊s email shows a gang bent on destroying the Middle East. It was as if a college Muslim Student Association (which Huma Abedin was member) took over the realm of power, not just any power, but the most powerful nation on earth, where all policy was directed by a handful ring of revolutionary students, who thought that the Middle East needed a facelift, and the only method was to start revolutions. The tragic part is that what you will read here is no fantasy or a simple school project, it is a reality that caused global destruction. It is in fact the prelude to World War III. \nFeast your eyes into the secret workings of the Hillary band-of-trouble makers. You will only conclude that Hillary Clinton and her aide, Huma Abedin, should not just be imprisoned, but should face the execution by lethal injection for all the crimes they have committed against humanity. \nReading through the volume of emails makes the operation easy to comprehend. A handful of opportunists with spy-huma continually flatter Hillary. Huma closely watches her confused buffoon boss and they all feed her daily dosages of unreliable information to form her mind by exerting undue influence. At times Huma even tells Hillary what time to ※take a nap§. Huma even disclosed to another opportunist staffer that their boss is ＆Often Confused＊. \nOf course, with a confused boss, Abedin had access to Hillary＊s Secretary of State email address that was not even secure using her email server to read everything coming in and everything going out. All this, regardless that she had no clearance to operate under such capacity. How she collected 650,000 emails does not take a rocket scientist to calculate. \nAbedin worked for Hillary since 1996. 650,000 emails would average at 90 emails per day. Why would any simple aide want to store 20 years worth of secret emails on another computer besides hers, calls for question that what we are dealing with here is more than just an ＆aide＊ but a hijabless spy taking the buffoon on a wild camel ride to create a Muslim Brotherhood revolution. Wrong. This buffoon is not a Hillary＊s double and is not ＆photo shopped＊ \nIt is clear from the volumes of emails we obtained so far from Wikileaks, Huma then becomes the conduit and filter that ＆provides or denies access＊ and dispenses just the right media press needed to form Hillary＊s worldview on all things ＆Middle East＊. This information concluded the policy which provoked civil unrest throughout the Muslim world. The team＊s duty was simply to build walls and fortifications making it hard to reach Clinton while ＆Charlie＊s angels＊ accomplished what was needed. First, to prove American＊s are voting for a buffoon is easy. In one example, Huma with undue influence writes Hillary: \n※I understand you are ok making the abu mazen call. Everyone agrees you should make it and they want you to do it today.§ \n※Everyone§ is the gang. They wanted her to speak to the Palestinian Authority leader Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas). Hillary responds: ※I don＊t know what I＊d say※. Huma would write back ※these are points from him about what to say. And they asked if you would do today.§ \nHillary can＊jt seem to survive without Huma, she writes Huma: ※let＊s go on our trip. I think it＊s worth it. And we can always add Israel as we did before!§ \nHuma: ※Ok great! We＊ll do ecuador now cause otherwise we lose him. So pinato, mubarak, lobo.§ \nHillary: ※That＊s fine. How are you doing?§ \nHuma: ※Excellent. Yesterday was a madhouse but got a lot accomplished.§ \nHuma bossing her buffoon boss, can＊t seem to have Hillary do a simple task: ※can you hang up the fax line, they will call again and try fax Just pick up phone and hang it up. And leave it hung up.§ \nObedient Hillary: ※I did.§ \nHuma: ※Yes but hang up one more time. So they can reestablish the line.§ \nHillary is so stupid ※I thought it was supposed to be off hook to work?§ \nWhen Huma wants things done (like when she wanted favors for the Saudis) Huma would use key names who said that Hillary ※should to do it§. The ※aged Saudi ruler§ needed to expedite his travel and Huma comes for the rescue. Huma would tell Hillary: ※Jeff mentioned we are helping expedite visas for [Saudi] delegation.§ \nThe circle who influenced Hillary most had everything in common regarding political views. Huma, a Muslim, and a couple, of really, the most self-hating Jews money can buy, the Blumenthals, used what Hillary gobbles up most: flattery . Huma even nicknames Hillary ※Fabius§ a throwback to Quintus Fabius Maximus a Roman politician around 280 BC who was twice appointed Dictator.§Reminder fabius at 3:30 Take a nap§ Huma tells Hillary as if she was mother and Hillary is a crib-ridden child. \nAfter every speech or interview, this handful, her gang, would chime in ※powerful§ ※wonderful§ as to fatten the bosses＊s head. Sidney Blumenthal who had made the greatest impact on Hillary was a senior adviser to Ms. Clinton during her 2008 and then was shut out of the State Department by the White House in 2009 for all his shenanigans. Presidential advisor Sidney Blumenthal, center, departs Capitol Hill after being deposed by House prosecutors Wednesday, Feb. 3, 1999 \nBut now we know one of the reasons why Hillary wanted a private server. Through the Jewish Blumenthal and even his two sons, Hillary was under constant undue-influence and pressure to trust and believe un-vetted opinions titled as ※facts§ from supposedly ※trustworthy§ ※secret sources§ from ※sources close to governments§. As it turns out, it was all third-hand rumors guised as ＆reliable＊ and ＆confidential＊ which formed the judgments of one of U.S. government＊s most powerful figures. \nSo if the issue at hand was the nation of lets say, Kyrgyzstan, Blumenthal would send Hillary some radio jockey＊s (Scott Horton) report: ※Scott Horton has just returned from a week in Kyrgyzstan, where he held lengthy private conversations with a range of leaders.§ \nWhat ※range of leaders§ was simply bogus. All Blumenthals contacts supposedly had ＆inside intel＊, they are supposedly well connected to all the higher-ups. Despite his untrustworthiness and his opportunism, the Blumenthal＊s had a lion-share of Hillary leaked emails . They continued their influence over Hillary by even having Max, Sidney＊s son, one of America＊s most notorious Israel haters, continually corresponding with Hillary influencing her mind. She loved his unsubstantiated articles and responded very favorably to them. With a private server they can now bash anyone who does not agree. Even Shoebat.com was not immune from reaching Hillary who was interested to later spread all sorts of slander on us. \nBlumenthal＊s writings was the springboard to Max＊s anti-Semitic Goliath , comparing Israel to the Nazis, even calling for the expulsion of the Jews from Israel, while comparing the Israel Defense Forces to the SS. Hillary was obliged to respond with favor: \n7/6/2010 每 ※Pls print 5 copies but w/out heading from Sid.§ 8/17/2010 每 ※Pls congratulate Max for another impressive piece. He＊s so good.§ \n11/18/2010- ※A very smart piece as usual.§ 4/7/2011 每 ※Will Max＊s piece be published anywhere else? It is powerful and touching.§ 12/23/2011 每 ※Max strikes again!§ 1/21/2012 每 ※Interesting reading.§ 9/13/2012 ※Your Max is a mitzvah!§ 12/7/2012 每 ※Good stuff. Where is he now?§ \nHillary＊s favorite reports were Max＊s, sent to her via his father Sidney, especially one that raised our eyebrow, on tracking ＆the dangerous Islamophobist Cabal＊ revealing Shoebat as one, where Hillary requested the report printed for her read. Reports that attempt to minuscule the whistle blowers as ※whacky§ is written by Max who signs his name ※ Blumenthal, The Great ※. \n※I＊m at the post office but Huma has this printed for you§ responds Monica Hanley regarding the report on us and the other dangerous ＆phobes＊. \nLiterally, hundreds of missive emails sent to Hillary completely re-brainwashing an already brainwashed buffoon with all sorts of conspiracy theories and untrustworthy information. \nAnd if Max Blumenthal was ＆like father like son＊, Huma was ＆like mother like daughter＊ and was not much different from the Blumenthals. The true color of Huma was revealed when one major Hillary Clinton Jewish donor, Haim Saban, in one article complimented Hillary (its how you get in) while stating that there needs to be more scrutiny on Muslim immigrants, Abedin, the filter, was not thoroughly pleased, of course, and had to chime in scolding the Jew who had some anti-Muslim immigration ideas: \n※Good interview. Thanks for sharing. But what you are saying about Muslims not consistent with HRC. Are you aware of that?§ \nIn other words, if you want to get through to Hillary, Huma was the gate-keeper and an ＆open sesame＊ requires that everyone say the magic words about Islam or say something nasty about Israel. \nIncluding all the anti-Israel reports will take an entire book. Yet when it came to Christians, we find nothing, not even a scant of services. Hillary would not reprimand Philippe Reines on his ※mother teresa§ comment calling Christians ※those crazy right§. In an email by Reines sent to Hillary and copied to Huma regarding a Catholic orphanage, an adoption ministry, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hailed as ※a home she helped open with Mother Teresa§ was closed down by red tape, Reines writes Hillary: \nJust FYI on the below, from one of those crazy right ※magazines§ 每 notes that the home you referenced in your Prayer Breakfast remarks has since closed. \nThere was no reprimand by Hillary to the type of language her advisor used. When it was a Christian publication, it was always dubbed ※crazy right§. \nBut perhaps satanism amongst the elites (and after reviewing the emails) is no longer conspiracy theory. The leaks from Colin Powel＊s phone and Wikileaks match emails from Blumenthal to Hillary: \n※I had lunch yesterday with Philip Bobbitt, who told me he had recently been at the Bohemian Grove and had lunch there with Kissinger and Colin Powell.§ \nEven the reputable National Geographic refers to the Bohemian Grove as having some pagan rituals and included the photos. Perhaps all the Free-Masonry theories about starting revolutions which I doubted as ＆conspiracy theory＊ do have merit that what we are dealing with here are satanic elitists who call all truth ＆conspiracy theory＊. \nThere was not one comment revering Christianity or anything Christian. In reality, what difference does it make whether Huma bows to a black stone, like the ancient Jews of the Sinai, who switched from their God Yahweh and bowed to a golden calf, or the elites bowing to Molech or an owl at the Bohemian Grove. It all shows, for one to get ahead, they must first ensure their names are first blotted out from the book of life. Indeed, there is neither Jew nor Gentile, there is only good or evil. \nVanity of vanities. But here comes the beefy tostada, that every American who votes, need to start paying close attention to. The ※best way to help Israel§ is to start a war in Syria was Blumenthal＊s grand idea. Anyone is welcome to access Wikileaks and see : \n※The best way to help Israel deal with Iran＊s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad.§ \nFinally, every American now can snoop into the elitist thinking, to see how camel dung is made, processed, and fed to American liberal buffoons who hate America＊s Christianity. Today is the day (just days before the election), we can remind you that ＆we told you so＊. \nIn an email sent by Sidney Blumenthal to Hilary Clinton suggesting that Iran would lose ※its only ally§ in the Middle East if the Syrian regime collapses. Our snooping into Hillary＊s emails allows us to look into the Israeli political debate in 2012, where the decisions made caused an outcome making Iran stronger than ever. And despite the disastrous Syrian civil war with hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced, Clinton still clung to the formula like Hitler clung to the trains, opting to transfer Jews to the crematoria than reverse course to save his nation. Likewise, Hillary continues on the destructive path. The email on 11/30/2015 reveals everything we need to know about Hillary and her gang＊s mindset. \nAnd when it comes to Syria＊s revolution sparked by the Free Syrian Army who were truly nothing more than Muslim Brotherhood, Islamist Jihadi rebels, who wanted to establish a Sharia driven government, Hillary would obtain the analysis from her henchman and aide, Robert Russo, regarding the makeup of the rebels. And just as the typical Muslims on the streets would do, Hillary instead of relying on CIA reports, obtained Al-Jazeera＊s false narrative. This even excited Hillary that the FSA ※are not fighting for Islam but they are [only] inspired by it§. The subject title for Hillary would read ※MUST READ ON COMPOSITION OF SYRIAN FSA§. \nThe rebels in Syria were painted as ＆partial Islamists＊ who do not believe in imposing Sharia law, but only used Jihad as a means of warfare against Bashar＊s tyranny. \nMany times Hillary would be in hibernation mode as the gang sent her dosages of mind forming articles from Al-Jazeera clips about how the Muslim world do not really hate the U.S. and that the real problem were strictly the Arab regimes that needed uprooting. Hillary would thank them for the info: \n※Sorry I＊m so far behind in responding每and thanking you每for forwarding this to us. The last month has been a whirlwind which is not likely to calm down ＃§ \nThe gang would encourage her with more flattery: \n※You of all people NEVER need to apologize. Truly can＊t wait until you are out and I can work with you again on issues we both think are so important.§ \nThe agents were less than crystal clear about anything, blaming innocent scapegoats and creating phony alibis, while mixing truths with lies. Truths like the Bush ＆no WMD＊ in Iraq, which indeed was a faulty conclusion, but that the best way to fight Al-Qaeda is to continue Bush＊s scandalous legacy, to destroy Iraq while they also destroy Tunisia, Libya and Egypt too ＃ \nSo under the guise of ＆aiding Israel＊ they called to ＆destroy Syria＊. \nReading these emails reveal just how ugly is the reality we live in, that the best way to remove any secular government in the Muslim world was to install an Islamist one. In an indication of her murderous and psychopathic nature, Buffoon Hillary, also wrote back in December 31, 2012, that it was the ※right thing§ to personally threaten Bashar Assad＊s family with death. Even the New York Times revealed this and began to pick up on more: Blumenthal＊s memos, often appending a note: ※Useful insight§ or ※We should get this around asap.§ In an August 2012 memo, Mr. Blumenthal described the new president of Libya, Mohamed Magariaf, as someone who would ※seek a discrete relationship with Israel§ and had ※many common friends and associates with the leaders of Israel.§ ※If true, this is encouraging,§ Mrs. Clinton wrote to Mr. Sullivan. ※Should consider passing to Israelis.§ \nBlumenthal would send emails with outlandish subject titles like ※Subject: H[illary]: HIGHLY IMPORTANT! COMPREHENSIVE INTEL REPORT ON LIBYA. AND DRINK 8 GLASSES OF WATER. SID§ \nHillary responds with ※I＊m happy to report that§. The key bait given to Hillary to believe these reports and approve them was this style: \n※Speaking on condition of absolute secrecy, a source with access to the Office of the President stated that during late December 2012 Magariaf and Zidan agreed that they must move quickly to deal with these problematic issues before they can address their long term strategy of developing productive diplomatic and business relationships with their neighboring states in North Africa, Western Europe and the United States.§ \nBlumenthal wanted business opportunities in Libya and Hillary was the key. The terminology to make Hillary believe was the use of jargon used by phony reports ※confidential§ ※absolute secrecy§ ※sensitive sources§ ※According to a very sensitive source§ and ※In the opinion of this sensitive source§ ※Extremely sensitive sources§ to even ※Sources with direct access to the governments of Libya and Israel, as well as the highest levels of European governments, and Western Intelligence and security services ＃§ \nIt was all bogus, the type of charade one find in Nigerian scams or DEBKAFile reports that come from supposedly Israeli intelligence where no serious sources are given. \nBuffoon Hillary would get her intel from the conspiracy theorist, Blumenthal, who claimed that Libya＊s Magariaf has plans and connections to make peace with Israel. The Buffoon had no clue, Magariaf has no links to Israel whatsoever. It was all a hoax, undue influence on a left-wing loon. \nRegarding the Egyptian revolution, the reports were void of the fact that the revolution was in reality a Muslim Brotherhood takeover. In one report Blumenthal even displays a fanciful victory against the Muslim Brotherhood by ※nationalist football hooligans known as the Ultras§. \nIt was as if the football hooligans represented the revolution. The key was to finagle the truth, use sophist and complicated jargon as to sound legit, and keep Hillary believing a fantasy, that Egyptians are tired of the tyranny of both, Hosni Mubarak as well as the Muslim Brotherhood, while explaining that is why they are staging a rebellion in Egypt. \nTruth is, the unrest was fomented by Washington and it was clearly a Muslim Brotherhood uprising as we have warned in the initial stages as the outcome was revealed later when it was too late. For example on the faulty labeling of terrorists as ＆moderate＊, in one report to Hillary, Blumenthal writes : \nI have included below a private report from ※Stratfor§ that underscores that Syria is attacking the moderate wing of Hamas and the Palestinian accord. \nThe simplistic labels worked. Hillary never asked is there a ＆ moderate wing of Hamas＊ and a ＆ moderate wing of Al-Qaeda＊ and a ＆ moderate wing of the Nazi party＊? Yet nowhere in Strafor＊s report does it even use such oxymoronic terms. \nAnd how Hillary was obtaining her influence on everything Middle East came strictly from this un-penetrable little circle. \n※The analysis on events in Egypt ring true to me§ Hillary responds to one of her aide henchwomen, Anne-Marie Slaughter. The latter was acting like a college student, all excited about her dissertation as to why Egypt needs a populace control instead of the current structure, objecting why Egyptian heads of state were ＆military＊ rulers and not ＆civilians＊. \nSlaughter according to her bio : ※From 2009每2011 she served as director of Policy Planning for the United States Department of State, the first woman to hold that position§. But when the results were disastrous since the real world at times is not explained by just bookworms, like Hillary＊s Benghazi fiasco, it was Mrs. Slaughter who sends Hillary the ointment, more deception that the rebels in Libya really love America: \n※To have Libyans carrying placards saying ※We are sorry America; this does not represent Islam,§ is exactly what we hoped for when we supported the Libyan intervention. Many Libyan bloggers/tweeters have taken the same stance. And to have elected Libyan and Tunisian governments publicly apologizing and denouncing the violence shows a very different face of Islam 〞 the Tunisian government is a Muslim Brotherhood government ＃§ \nIn other words, the Muslim Brotherhood was tame. To Hillary and her gang, it was no longer that this cobra spawned Al-Qaeda and Hamas and even those had ＆moderates＊. It was ＆the Muslim Brotherhood loves America＊ and therefore, Hillary ＆loves the Brotherhood＊. \nHillary was completely brainwashed to believe Egypt＊s Muslim brotherhood will revive as a non-Islamist movement or half-Islamist ＆moderate＊ and will all fix itself as it shifts from being uncontrolled by the military. She responds to one release which said: \n※The last couple of weeks have seen a shift in Egyptian politics. It appeared that the Egyptian President, Mohammed Morsi, exercised his authority over the military establishment, and dismissed Field Marshal Mohammed Tantawi.§ \nThey just love this word ＆shift＊ as if evil shifts and evolves to the better. The Muslim Brotherhood therefore played an important role in the dream world of Hillary that ※military rule§ is no more and now its populace rule as planed by the gang. \n※The analysis on events in Egypt ring true to me§ responds Hillary. After all the intel sent to her said: \n※Hosni Mubarak, in this regard, was not a civilian authority: he was a military one, and part of the same structure, which simultaneously occupied the president＊s office.§ \nSo when ※ousting all dictators§ domino effect began sparking in Tunisia, Huma would send Hillary the praise reports that now she is a prophetess: \n※It was a fallout she herself [Hillary] had warned of just two weeks earlier. In a dramatic speech in Qatar, Clinton warned Arab leaders their regimes would ※sink in the sand§ if they did not reform their autocratic governments and create opportunities for their young citizens. Two days after that speech, Tunisia＊s President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled the country after he was overthrown amid massive protests. Inspired, Egyptians began similar protests. Now, the U.S. pondered the potential fall of Hosni Mubarak 〞 a critical ally who for 30 years served as a linchpin of security in the Middle East 〞 which would dramatically affect America＊s entire policy in the region for years to come. ※There were a first few moments of wonderment and then she said, ＆We have to dive in,§ recalled Cheryl Mills, Clinton＊s counselor and chief of staff. Bad timing for a tough test ＃§ \nOne would think that such news was a disaster, but the message from Huma was simple, it was plan in progress. In other words, thus said Hillary and the world moved. Hillary thou art Fabius and now she can nap again. \nAnd Muslim Brotherhood ＆populace control＊ they got. And what would sound troubling to the normal mind, Huma would send a praise Hillary report . She could not even wait till she signed into Hillary＊s server. She writes from state.gov to Hillary, giving her the news of the salvation caused by her messiah; riots sparking the Arab Spring starting in Egypt and spreading to Yemen, Libya, Kuwait, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sudan, India and Iran. To the ＆gang＊ it was like watching a fireworks as Huma, the real boss behind the scene gives Hillary full credit: \nI＊m giving you credit for inspiring the ※peaceful§ protests. \n※Peaceful§ in quotes was meant to mean ※nothing peaceful§. Captain chaos did the job. Even when Huma reported to Hillary ※The Muslim Brotherhood, the big winner in the first election since the ousting of President Hosni Mubarak last February§, this was ＆good news＊ and all Hillary did was to respond with some romance : \nHave I told you how much I miss you on these trips? Not nearly as much fun [without you]. \nHillary wanted Huma by her bedside. Huma, of course, with flattery speaks of their adventures together: \nOh that＊s so nice to hear!! Its soo hard to not be there. I miss our many adventures. Jeff feltman is beside himself that you emailed him bday greetings＃.says you are ※incredible※. \nFrom the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, to Al-Nahda＊s Muslim Brotherhood success in Tunisia , Huma would send the news reports to Hillary as if it was ＆mission accomplished＊. One cannot find a single line of any worry or comment resembling ＆we screwed up＊. The Hillary gang would even send their boss images on how beautiful Ramadan was from images and photos on Al-Jazeera, the type of which dazzles Hillary＊s imaginations. A Palestinian boy in Gaza City plays with fireworks to celebrate the beginning of Ramadan \nIt was all progress as usual as if chaos was the goal. It is as if Hillary herself was Muslim or that this retard team of women thought they were about to take control of Islam to revolutionize it as Huma says ＆Yay＊ when the Saudi Monarch stopped the lashing of a woman for driving. \nEvil is always tucked under the good, just as camel-dung is tucked under the non-existing snow of the desert. The outcome was that the Clinton/Obama Administration, this whole time, has been the main sponsor of the growth of terrorism in the Middle East, refugee crisis to destroy Europe, real conspiracies that caused the death of countless Assyrian, Copt, Orthodox and Catholic Christians, and all was done in the name of ※protecting Israel§. \nYet we were painted by Clinton＊s media henchmen as ※the conspiracy theorists§? \nUS support of Huma＊s family＊s dream aiding Saudi Arabia, financially and logistically, backed Syrian Islamist rebels which helped lead the creation of ISIS, a policy led to a war that has dragged in Turkey, the Kurds, Russia, Iraq, Iran, our Gulf allies and too many radical terrorist organizations to count, into the apocalypse, the very quagmire we see today which will lead to World War III. \nIt is perhaps an ideal time to reveal the man whom everyone thought was so conspiratorial that he was viewed as Balaam＊s donkey. Yet it was this donkey, Mummer Gaddafi , who prophetically declared to the Arab Summit that after killing Saddam Hussein, he told Bashar al-Assad ※you will be next§. Watch Bashar Al-Assad smile as if what this donkey said was madness: \nGod can speak through a select donkey while the geniuses laughing were the real jack-asses. To Hillary, Huma and the gang, the tribal leaders are ＆out＊ and the Islamist universalists are ＆in＊. \nIt took years before Americans woke up to the ugliest of realities, where much repentance is needed, as to what happened to people, be it Muslim or Christian. Over a quarter million butchered. Lord have mercy. Do not exclusively blame the terrorist for the ISIS attacks on U.S soil. We all reap what we sow. \nWhy Israel and the U.S. want the Arab tribal leaders removed is simple to explain. It was either that the Russian influence is weakened or creating chaotic Islamist regimes will finally unite Russia, Europe and the U.S. to unify against the Islamist savage. But this thinking disregards that creating such a Muslim beast brings utter destruction to the Christians and all secular pro-west Muslims living under the devil＊s rule as we see Turkey＊s call to be the peace-keepers of Iraq and Syria, in fact, the whole of the Muslim world. \nWith Hillary, the gang conspired to subvert the power of the office of Secretary of State to violate UN Charter, International Law and U.S. law committing treason and committing war crimes. \nAnd while claiming ＆love for Israel＊ or we ＆did this for Israel＊ reality was much different. The gang were acting more like a Muslim Student Union at a college campus. They were feeding Hillary all sorts of mad ideas to raise monies for ※Palestine§ while shaming Israel . Hillary would even respond with: ※I am very interested§. Her aide Marie Slaughter dreamt this fanciful idea to have Hillary influence billionaires donate for Palestine: \n※This may be a crazy idea, but as far as we can tell we need ideas. Suppose we launched a ※Pledge for Palestine§ campaign that copies Warren Buffet＊s ※The Giving Pledge§ campaign, described below 〞 he＊s trying to get 40 billionaires to give away most of their money. I had asked some S/P folks to think about how we might take that campaign global to help change the attitudes of elites in places like Pakistan and Latin America, but perhaps Warren Buffet could be convinced to lend his name 〞 or perhaps Michael Bloomberg or Danny Abraham (together with a very wealthy Muslim) 每 to a similar Pledge for Palestine campaign. Such a campaign among billionaires/multi-millionaires around the world would reflect a strong vote of confidence in the building of a Palestinian state and could offset the ending of the moratorium for Palestinians (there would also be a certain shaming effect re Israelis, who would be building settlements in the face of a pledge for peace). With even 30 calls to the right people in the Clinton fundraising network it should be possible to generate a substantial enough amount quickly enough to capture the public imagination on the heels of the President＊s speech and, critically, to serve as an expression of global solidarity with the Palestinians※ \nHow these women expected 40 billionaires to give up ※most of their money§ and wealth in a fundraiser for Palestine is the type of dreams one finds in a fantasy book. Did this gang of women think they are in the era of one thousand and one nights copulating with some Caliph to persuade him to pay all of his kingdom? \nFrom Egypt, to the Freedom Flotilla in Gaza, Hillary was interested responding with ※please print§ ※print§ print§ and ※print§. \nPrint what? How ※this [Turkish supported Flotilla to Gaza] is movement that is going to grow and grow and that is going to be impossible to stop§. A revolution into the heart of Israel coming from the sea from all over the Muslim world was the gang＊s solution to the Israeli-Palestinian problem. \nHow is that good for Israel? So in the name of ＆aiding Israel＊ they ＆destroyed the Arabs＊ and in the name of ＆aiding Israel＊ they were ＆destroying Israel＊. \nAnd when in 2009, the Muslim Rashad Hussain, was named deputy associate counsel to President Barack Obama, he tried to break protocol writing Huma directly: ※Hope you are doing well. I＊m looking forward to getting started as soon as possible§. Huma then writes to Cheryl Mill knowing that Cheryl was on vacation to deal with this ※I Don＊t want to bother you on vacation but see below§. Denis McDonough who was copied answers: ※Weird. I will take care of this§. \nRashad Hussein was not careful and stealth enough to enter the inner circle to promote the OIC (Organization of Islamic Conference), which is also Huma＊s mother＊s aspiration to join forces of the Muslim Brotherhood. He was appointed by the government and made comments to the Musim Student Association in 2004 supporting the convicted terrorist fundraiser Sami al-Arian. A direct contact with Rashad who was toxic could compromise everything. \nYet Hillary still consulted Rashad via Jacob Sullivan. Rashad was not told that it was Hillary who wanted the advise. She had asked ※ Does he [Rashad] have any suggestions as to how we handle the Ulema?§ \nUlema is Arabic for Muslim scholars . Rashad did not even know the advice went to Hillary who wanted an education on how to handle the Quran when meeting Muslim scholars: Jake- A few points (including some background) to respond to your friend＊s question每 Muslims believe that the Quran is the direct word of God and the final revelation that was sent to correct human changes that were made to the messages sent to previous prophets (Abraham, Moses, Jesus, etc.). They believe that the message sent to these previous prophets [Judaism, Christianity] was essentially Islam, but was changed [by Jews and Christians] because the texts (Bible, Torah, etc.) were not preserved＃ certain rules of etiquette have developed for handling the Quran: ＃ one should keep the Quran above the waist when handling it and should keep it only in clean places (definitely never in a bathroom) ＃ many scholars would say that unless non-Muslims are handling it for educational purposes, they should avoid handling it all together. In terms of disposing of old Qurans or other documents with God＊s name, your friend is right ＃ Muslims guard vigilantly against the deification of any person, including the Prophet Muhammad, because they fear that people will begin to worship him (as Christians began to worship Jesus ＃ there have been so many recent instances of desecration in the news that people are not as shocked as they used to be to hear these types stories (Terry Jones, Gitmo toilet story, urination on corpses story) ＃ That said, Muslims all over the world are definitely saddened/upset by the news, but for the most part, they understand that the Quran itself teaches that violence is not the answer. Rashad \nSo Hillary was getting her Islamic education via Rashad Hussain. Hillary knew that claiming the Son of God and that Jesus is God was an insult to Muslims. \nHillary＊s chief of staff and counsel Cheryl Mills, during the time Michelle Bachman began to disclose our findings on Huma＊s entanglements with Islamists, Abedin and family sent Hillary the media＊s praise report of Huma: \n※There＊s John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Ed Rollins, Re",

By the time she got to the Capitol, the Pentagon had been hit by a third plane. Capitol police were evacuating Senate office buildings. She dialed her daughter, who was in New York. She dialed her husband, who was in Australia. She and other senators received a briefing at the Capitol police station early in the evening.

    "title": "21 Things We＊ve Learned About Hillary Clinton from Wikileaks That the MSM Won＊t Share＃But YOU Can!",
    "text": "Daisy Luther \nLet＊s talk about Wikileaks. \nFirst of all, the organization was founded by Julian Assange back in 2006. Their website explains what they are all about: \n※WikiLeaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war, spying, and corruption. It has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses.§ \nIn the 11 years that they＊ve been publishing documents, they have not been disproven a single time. Their record for authentication is perfect. (Learn more here and here .) \nSo this means that a person would be pretty silly to disregard anything in the reams of information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, the Clinton Foundation, and the political shenanigans that would put the Machiavellis to shame. \nHere are 21 of the most important things that have come out about Hillary Clinton, that unfortunately, no one is reporting on in the mainstream. In the interest of brevity, each topic has a link to an article that goes deeper into the leak. (In no particular order.) John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign had a nice cozy dinner with Peter Kadzik, one of the top officials in the Department of Justice＃the day after the Benghazi hearing . Kadzik＊s son also asked for a job on the Clinton campaign, and, the icing on the corruption cupcake? Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch, who famously met with Bill Clinton on her private plane right before Hillary＊s interrogation about Emailgate. ( source ) We all knew that the Clinton Foundation was just a way for the Clinton family to launder money, and now there＊s proof. Zero Hedge writes, ※＃today＊s Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band＊s firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family＊s private business endeavors.§ A pundit called this leak ※The Rosetta Stone of the Clinton Foundation,§ meaning that with this document, all of their shady financial dealings could be unraveled and translated. ( source ) Clinton is unable to speak for very long without a podium to lean on . Numerous leaked emails reference how certain interviews have to be kept short because she＊d be without one. And this article references a very interesting reason why this may be the case 每 surprisingly it isn＊t related to her health. ( source ) The leaks also show that Clinton intends to do her best to restrict the Second Amendment. Brian Fallon, the national press secretary for the Clinton campaign, wrote, ※ Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President 每 universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability .§ According to an analysis on The Daily Sheeple, ※Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook, Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold.§ ( source ) The campaign was concerned that the sexual escapades of Bill Clinton could be likened to those of another disgraced celebrity, Bill Cosby . Political operative Ron Klain sent an urgent email saying that Hillary should anticipate the following questions, § How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did? Is his conduct relevant to your campaign? You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused him? Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?§ ( source ) Clinton＊s campaign deliberately leaked an embarrassing photo of a swimsuit-clad Bernie Sanders to the press, ironically insinuating that it was proof he was bought off by Wall Street. Perez Hilton wrote, ※ Bernie Sanders lounges at elite Martha＊s Vineyard pool, summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists .§ ( source ) Clinton admitted she is out of touch with the middle class in a speech to Goldman-Black Rock in 2014. ※And I am not taking a position on any policy, but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. And I never had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean, were there really rich people, of course there were. My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We had accessible health care. We had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn＊t believe in mortgages. So I lived that. And now, obviously, I＊m kind of far removed because the life I＊ve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy , but I haven＊t forgotten it.§ ( source ) She made this rather NWO remark at a 2013 paid speech to Brazilian bank Banco Itau: ※ My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders , some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.§ ( source ) In a leak of yet another paid speech, this time to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013, Clinton said that Jordan and Turkey ※ can＊t possibly vet all those refugees so they don＊t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.§ Meanwhile, if Clinton has her way , we will be warmly welcoming 65,000 refugees a year, which makes Obama＊s 10,000 a year look like small potatoes. ( source ) Clinton blackmailed the Chinese by telling them that the US would base missiles in the region if they didn＊t exert some control over North Korean aggression. ※ So China, come on. You either control them or we＊re going to have to defend against them ,§ she purportedly told the audience at a Goldman Sachs conference in June 2013. ( source ) In May 2015, Clinton was no longer Secretary of State but was ready to announce she was running for President when she was invited to attend a summit in Morrocco. The implication from the leaked emails was that a $12 million ※donation§ from the king of Morocco was dependent on Clinton attending the summit. Human Abedin, usually loyal to her boss, had concerns . ※ If HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter. She created this mess and she knows it. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this,§ Abedin wrote to Robbie Mook in a November 2014 email. Incidentally, Clinton didn＊t attend. Bill and Chelsea went instead and the $12 million donation was not forthcoming. (source ) Podesta attacked Clinton＊s primary election rival Bernie Sanders for criticizing the Paris climate change agreement. ※ Can you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it? § said Podesta. ( source ) Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria . ※ My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,§ she told employees of the bank in South Carolina, which had paid her about $225,000 to give a speech. ※We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can＊t help themselves. They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we＊re doing and I want credit for it. § (source ) There is indeed a definite link between the Clinton campaign and what MSM is allowed to say. The campaign has colluded directly with media spokespersons that read like a Who＊s Who in American Media : Dan Merica from CNN, Haim Saban of Univision, John Harwood of CNBC and the NY Times, Rebecca Quick of CNBC, Maggie Haberman of NY Times and Politico, John Harris of Politico, Donna Brazile formerly of CNN, Roland Martin of TV-One, Marjorie Pritchard of The Boston Globe, and Louise Mensch of Heat Street. ( source ) As everyone knows, the DNC deliberately screwed Bernie Sanders out of the nomination ( Bonus: Wikileaks also released some of the DNC＊s voicemails on the topic ). There are emails that prove who is actually pulling HRC＊s puppet strings and that puppeteer is George Soros . The shadow government is not just a conspiracy theory 每 it really exists and Hillary＊s job is to keep George Soros happy. ( source ) Excerpts from her speeches to Wall Street read like a guide to two-faced treachery. In them, she clearly points out that sometimes you ※need§ to lie. ※If everybody＊s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.§ ( source ) Wikileaks emails show that back when she still worked for CNN and before she became an employee of the Clinton campaign, Donna Brazile gave Hillary the questions in advance for her ※impromptu§ CNN Town Hall questions. ( source ) The campaign got to ※approve§ articles in influential publications like NY Times, HuffPo, CNN, NBC, CBS, NYT, MSNBC, and Politico, showing a massive collusion with the mainstream media, who has hounded Trump relentlessly in an effort to distract from HRC＊s abysmal candidacy. ( source ) Through the treasure trove of Wikileaks emails, we can gain an accurate picture of how Hillary really feels about us all (spoiler: basket of deplorables, basement dwellers and right wing conspirators) ( source ) President Obama knew the whole time that her emails were not coming from the secure State Department server. Cheryl Mills wrote to John Podesta, ※W e need to clean this up 每 he has emails from her 每 they do not say state.gov .§ You see, Obama＊s emails all have to be from§whitelisted§addresses. So someone, somewhere, added her nonsecure email to his whitelist. ( source ) \nAnd finally, here＊s the real reason that treacherous shrew is involved in politics. And let me tell you, it isn＊t because she yearns to make things better for anyone but herself. (emphasis mine.) \nAt the Goldman Sachs Builders and Innovators Summit, Clinton responded to a question from chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, who quipped that you ※go to Washington§ to ※make a small fortune.§ Clinton agreed with the comment and complained about ethics rules that require officials to divest from certain assets before entering government. ※ There is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives, § Clinton said. ( source ) Together, we cannot be ignored. I am on a mission between now and the Presidential Election on November 8th and I hope that you will join me. I am going to work day and night to provide the coverage that the mainstream media is not. It isn＊t until we combine all of our voices that we can make people listen to the scandals, the rigging, and the corruption, not only in this election but in the system in general. Please join your voice with mine by liking, sharing, and spreading the word. Together, we cannot be ignored. Together, we are an army. Read more about Hillary Clinton",

    "title": "Will Barack Obama Delay Or Suspend The Election If Hillary Is Forced Out By The New FBI Email Investigation?",
    "text": "The Economic Collapse 每 by Michael Snyder \nJust when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton＊s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails ※did not come from her private server§, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the ※emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry§, and according to some reports there may be ※potentially thousands§ of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? \nLet＊s take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ \nAfter recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ※appear to be pertinent§ to the email probe. \n※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,§ Comey wrote the chairmen. ※I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.§ \nAt this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton＊s closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton＊s Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ \nWe don＊t know what this means yet except that it＊s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that＊s where we are＃ \nIs it a certainty that we won＊t learn before the election? I＊m not sure it＊s a certainty we won＊t learn before the election. \nOne thing is, it＊s possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ \nIf the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? \nIt is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. \nSo those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. \nBut if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year＊s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group＊s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nIt would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. \nIn such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be ※fair§ until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. \nMeanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. \nAnd CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ \nAn artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. \nMogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. \nThe AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. \nWithout Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. \nSo if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. \nAt this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.",

    "title": "Tancredo: Hillary Clinton Should Step Down to Avoid Constitutional Crisis",
    "text": "Breitbart 每 by Tom Tancredo \nThe announcement by the FBI that it has reopened the criminal investigation into Hillary＊s email server is more than an embarrassment to the Clinton presidential campaign. \nIt is a ticking time bomb that could do more damage to our country than the Watergate scandal if allowed to explode. \nThe Watergate investigation revealed Nixon＊s attempted cover-up of the June 1972 break-in at Democratic National Committee HQ at the Watergate Hotel. It was the cover-up that led to Nixon＊s downfall, not the break-in. \nThe FBI investigation has already revealed Hillary Clinton＊s perjury, and a new investigation of additional classified documents shared through her personal email server can lead to criminal indictments〞unless the FBI itself wants to fall on its sword in a far more visible and viral cover-up than we have seen to date. \nIt is not at all clear that the FBI has not already been hopelessly compromised: Did the FBI have knowledge of Barack Obama＊s participation in the illegal email server and the president＊s lies about it to the public? Who will investigate the investigators? \nWhat happens if Clinton wins the election and is then indicted on criminal charges prior to January 20? What happens if the FBI again fails to recommend criminal charges but the House of Representatives finds her in contempt of Congress and asks the Department of Justice to prosecute her for perjury? What happens if the Congress holds up all presidential appointments and all Democrat legislation until a nonpartisan Special Prosecutor is appointed? \nThe likelihood of a constitutional crisis grows each day that Clinton continues to lie about her classified emails and continues to avoid criminal penalties for her possible perjury. If Clinton wins the election and is sworn in as President, she can only be removed by impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate. If Democrats win majority control of the Senate on November 8, Clinton could defy the Congress and either refuse to appoint a Special Prosecutor or appoint someone who would rubber stamp her criminal behavior. \nThe patriotic thing for Hillary Clinton to do would be to step aside and let the DNC select Tim Kaine as the party＊s presidential candidate. But since that would almost certainly lead to a tidal wave of support for Donald Trump, that will not happen. The national Democrat Party is not famous for its fidelity to constitutional norms. \nThe difference between the Watergate scandal and the Clinton perjury scandal is that in 1974, a delegation of Republican members of Congress went to Nixon and told him point blank he must resign because they would vote to remove him if he didn＊t. Republicans suffered devastating losses in the 1974 elections because of the Nixon resignation〞even though no members of Congress were implicated in Nixon＊s cover-up. \nIn the Watergate scandal, Republicans in Congress put the truth and the rule of law above politics. Democrats do not behave that way; Democrats put politics above everything, including the Constitution. Besides, the Clintons have been here before and survived. In 1998, Bill Clinton committed perjury 〞 and obstruction of justice 每 and got away with it because, as Democrat Senators admitted publicly, they would not remove one of their own for merely telling a lie. After all, they said, Bill Clinton＊s lie was not about policy, it was about sex with a White House intern. \nThe national media will of course do its best to deflect public attention away from the new FBI criminal investigation. Indeed, that is already happening. \nLike liberal newspapers across the country, The Denver Post considers it necessary to link the FBI story to the Associated Press survey of public opinion on the veracity of the ※groping§ allegations against Trump. The media has not yet managed to find any credible allegation of criminal wrong-doing against Trump, but is working hard to divert public attention away from Clinton＊s newest scandal. \nA constitutional crisis is not entirely avoided even if Hillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump on November 8. Let＊s suppose President Trump asks newly appointed Attorney General Rudy Giuliani to appoint a Special Prosecutor to investigate Clinton＊s misuse of a private email server. \nA Democrat-controlled Senate could obstruct that investigation and threaten all kinds of retribution against the new President. Thus, in typical Washington fashion, a bipartisan deal would likely be struck to let Hillary off the hook〞all in the name, of course, of saving taxpayer money. \nA very real constitutional crisis has already occurred and it is ongoing 〞 the transparent politicization of the FBI and the Department of Justice by the Obama team and the resulting loss of public confidence in those law enforcement institutions. Americans now have additional reasons to be wary of expanded federal powers.",

    "title": "Election Law Violation Was Hillary＊s Idea",
    "text": "Search Election Law Violation Was Hillary＊s Idea Orders to use Donald Duck to foment violence at Trump rallies came straight from the top. October 27, 2016 Matthew Vadum \nDemocrat Hillary Clinton personally authorized illegal dirty tricks operations against Republican Donald Trump＊s campaign, according to top Democrats appearing in undercover video. \nIn the third Hillary-related video released by ACORN slayer James O＊Keefe and his Project Veritas Action Fund this past Sunday (Oct. 23), Clinton is directly implicated in a scheme to use Donald Duck to mock Trump and troll his supporters at Trump campaign rallies. \nAmong Disney cartoon characters Donald Duck was a natural choice. After all, his name used to appear regularly on voter registration documents when Bill and Hillary Clinton＊s favorite community organizing group, the now-defunct ACORN, hired hobos and felons to go on voter-registration drives. \nEarlier this year Democrats in Donald Duck costumes started appearing at Trump events across America. Costumed individuals would walk around carrying signs. One said, ※Trump ducks releasing his tax return.§ \nThis cutesy publicity stunt isn＊t necessarily the problem, though. The problem is that Hillary Clinton ordered it and apparently broke the law by coordinating with a tax-exempt nonprofit group. \nProminent in the video is political organizer Robert Creamer who is very high up in the Democratic Party＊s hierarchy. He has reportedly visited the Obama White House 342 times, including 47 meetings with Obama personally. \nOne of the visits took place in Obama＊s personal living quarters. \n※It＊s a very big deal that Creamer visited the president＊s residence in the White House,§ a former senior White House employee told FrontPage in an interview. ※White House employees can work there for years and never visit the residence.§ \nCreamer, a practitioner of the agitation arts taught by Marxist community organizing guru Saul Alinsky, is husband tof Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a socialist and advocate of single-payer health care. Creamer is considered by many to be the legislative architect of Obamacare. He also wrote a series of bad checks to cover his salary at a nonprofit and went to prison. Prosecutors wanted to send him up the river for 37 months but he got off with merely five months and 11 months of home confinement from a friendly Democrat judge. \nCreamer is a founder of the unsavory political consulting firm Democracy Partners . The list of ※partners§ on the company＊s website is a who＊s who of elite Democratic Party power players. \nIn addition to Creamer, the partners are: \nMidwest Academy founder Heather Booth ; website developer Marc Cerabona ; organizer Wyatt Closs ; SEIU veteran Mac D＊Alessandro ; Maccabee Group founder Brett C. Di Resta ; CrossCurrents Foundation co-founder Ken Grossinger ; former Media Matters for America online organizer David Grossman ; former SEIU national field director for politics John Hennelly ; strategic communications advisor Marilyn Katz ; organizer Jackie Kendall ; strategist Lupe Lopez ; political consultant Mike Lux ; strategic advisor Josie Mooney ; consultant Patrick Pannett ; organizer Christine Pelosi (her mother is House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi); USAction president Khalid Pitts ; former DNC general counsel Joe Sandler ; consultant Linda Saucedo ; fundraiser Renee Schaeffer ; former New Organizing Institute senior fellow Joel Silberman ; and organizer Cheri Whiteman . \nListed as ※associates§ are Lauren Windsor , executive director of American Family Voices, and Aaron Black , who appears in the undercover videos. Black describes himself in the footage as ※basically deputy rapid response director for the DNC on the ground at Trump events,§ adding ※nobody＊s supposed to know about me.§ \n(FrontPage published an article yesterday examining Democracy Partners.) \nFor a master practitioner of fascistic tactics, Creamer is amazingly lacking in self-awareness (or just plain dishonest). He wrote a fatuous, ahistorical op-ed in the Huffington Post earlier this year titled ※Can Fascism Triumph in America?§ \n※Like other fascist movements, Trump says out loud -- and legitimates -- the kind of hateful, violent language that was previously whispered only in the privacy of people's living rooms.§ \nBear in mind that quite apart from his mischaracterization of Trump＊s public statements, Creamer is shown in the videos masterminding an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents. \nFomenting and carrying out acts of violence against political opponents was what the fascist Third Reich did, using the Sturmabteiling or S.A., also called brown shirts and storm troopers. Ditto for Mussolini＊s Squadristi (black shirts), Mao＊s Red Guards, Iran＊s Basij , and Haiti＊s Tonton Macoute . \nCreamer explains the Donald Duck action in the third video. \n※In the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground,§ Creamer says in one of several exchanges. ※So, by God, we would get ducks on the ground.§ \nCreamer makes it clear he knows that this coordination between his consulting firm, Democracy Partners, and the campaign was a huge legal landmine when he said: ※Don＊t repeat that to anybody.§ \n※The whole duck thing? That came about, the reason we moved it from DNC to [Americans United for Change] was to just do a hopscotch, but the actual idea was hatched way back in May,§ Creamer associate Scott Foval said, making a pun. \n※The duck has to be an Americans United for Change entity,§ Creamer said. ※This had to do only with some problem between [now acting DNC chief] Donna Brazile and ABC, which is owned by Disney, because they were worried about a trademark issue. That＊s why. It＊s really silly.§ \nWe originally launched this duck because Hillary Clinton wants the duck. In any case, so she really wanted this duck figure out there doing stuff, so that was fine. So, we put all these ducks out there and got a lot of coverage. And Trump taxes. And then ABC/Disney went crazy because they thought our original slogan was ＆Donald ducks his taxes, releasing his tax returns.＊ \nCreamer is shown in the video hoping Disney would file a lawsuit against Democrats for using Donald Duck in the campaign, likely because such a thing would generate publicity. \n※Let them sue us. Please God,§ he says, looking to the heavens and clasping his hands together as if in prayer. ※I doubt they will because we＊re paying to rent or buy the suits, that＊s where they get their license fees. We＊re not using it for commercial purposes.§ \nThe Wall Street Journal reported Aug. 18 that ＆※Donald ducks＊ was the creation of the Democratic National Committee.§ Then on Sept. 8 the paper reported the DNC ※is no longer associated with the duck ＃ Americans United for Change is now managing the duck ＃§ \nBut out of public view the DNC and the Clinton campaign were still controlling the duck operation, breaking federal campaign coordination laws, O＊Keefe says in narrating the third video. \n※We kind of divvy up responsibilities. So sometimes it will be, like, campaign owned,§ said Jenna Price, assistant press secretary at the DNC. ※So sometimes you will see that they advised something, or they are taking credit for things. So, like, we aren＊t taking credit for the duck anymore. That＊s like, random ally groups. But it＊s still something that we＊re involved in.§ \nBrad Woodhouse, president of Americans United for Change, expected the presence of the duck at events would spark violence. ※I think this duck is going to get roughed up somewhere.§ \nIn one segment, Foval says, ※I almost got punched on Monday morning, I mean, I was in a duck costume.§ \nThe nation＊s campaign coordination laws were enacted after President Richard Nixon＊s Watergate scandal, O＊Keefe notes. \nFor an activity to violate the law it must meet a three-part test, he explains. \nFirst, there must be payment by someone other than the candidate for election-related activity. Second, a campaign has to be materially involved in shaping communications for a third party group. And third, electoral advocacy has to take place close to an election. \nO＊Keefe continues: \nThe payment [prong of the test] is complicated but just the fact that Foval, a paid employee of Americans United for Change, was the duck at some events constitutes payment by AUfC. Conduct, based on their own admission the campaign, Creamer, their agent, and AUfC coordinated the duck activities. And finally content. ＆Donald ducks＊ is undeniably political content directed against one candidate for the sole purpose of helping another. \nThe fourth video, released yesterday, isn＊t so much an expose of wrongdoing but it does provide ample evidence of Creamer＊s ties to the Clinton campaign and to President Obama himself. \nIn a phone call Creamer says ※I spend most of my time overseeing the Trump events around the country. I mean, that＊s what I do for the Clinton campaign, uh, so that＊s interesting as well.§ \nIn another scene when an undercover reporter phones saying he needs an immigration lawyer with powerful connections for a wealthy client in Syria, Creamer makes it clear he is happy to help by reaching out to Obama's inner circle. \nI just need to, I will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then. Okay? ＃ On the first, well, I＊ll just talk, the guy I＊m going to talk to first, to see if this is up his alley, the first thing is up his alley. It＊s the guy who ran the campaign for President Obama. He has a firm that＊s pretty well connected. \nIn another setting, Creamer says: \nHere＊s what I do for the Clinton campaign by the way. I＊m a consultant to the Clinton campaign. Wherever Trump or Pence go in the country, we make sure that there are press events in the TV market or whatever ＃ whether they＊re big turnouts or little turnouts, whatever, that drive our message wherever the candidate goes to drive his message. So that on any given day they will be between them probably in six places. So our team makes sure there are events in all those six places every day. So it is a lot of events, and we try and help define the other candidate. \n※Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters,§ added Creamer. \nHe continued: \nI＊m in this campaign mainly to deal with what, you know, earned media, with the television, radio. With earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising. There would be a whole different advertising ＃ everybody is driven on the same tracks, though. So then there are a couple, a bunch of people in the Brooklyn office [of the Clinton campaign] that are responsible for possible aspects of communication. Like, we do rapid response and there is a guy there I work with heavily, is the guy that I was just communicating with on that kind of stuff. For instance, we just found, I just sent him a note beforehand when we came here that said, ＆My understanding is there might be another revelation of another woman talking about Trump this afternoon.＊ \nCreamer bragged again about his ties to President Obama. \nOh Barack Obama＊s was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect. \nObama is ※a pro,§ Creamer said. ※I＊ve known the president since he was a community organizer in Chicago.§ \nI was just at an event with him in Chicago actually, on Friday last. He is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the, the health care bill, trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues. \nThe second video , released Oct. 18, was a primer on how Democrats get away with massive voter fraud. \n※It＊s a very easy thing for Republicans to say, well they＊re bussing people in,§ said Scott Foval, then national field director for Americans United for Change. \nWell you know what? We＊ve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin＊ assholes for 50 years and we＊re not going to stop now 每 we＊re just going to find a different way to do it. So, I mean I grew up with that idea. They used to bus people out to Iowa. If we needed people out there we＊d bus people out to Iowa. \nIn a discussion O＊Keefe described as focusing on bringing people from one state to another state to vote illegally, Foval, who also worked as deputy political director at George Soros-funded People for the American Way (PfAW), explains how to get away with voter fraud. \nInstead of bussing people in, it is better to have them travel in their own personal vehicles, he said. \nWould they charge each individual of voter fraud? Or are they going to go after the facilitator for conspiracy, which they could prove? It＊s one thing if all these people drive up in their personal cars. If there＊s a bus involved? That changes the dynamic. \n※It＊s the legality, because you can prove conspiracy if there＊s a bus,§ he said. ※If there are cars it＊s much harder to prove ＃ if there＊s enough money you have people drive their POVs [personally owned vehicles] or you can have them drive rentals.§ \nFoval says it＊s easy to keep the voter fraud operation a secret. ※So you use shells. Use shell companies.§ \nDemocrats are untouchable, he said. ※The question is, whether when you get caught by a reporter, does that matter? Because does it turn into an investigation or not? In this case, this state, the answer is no, because they don＊t have any power to do anything.§ \nFoval explained in the first video how pro-Clinton super PACs communicate with each other and how their information finds its way to the DNC, presumably a violation of federal law. \n※I guaran-damn-tee you that the people who run the super PACs all talk to each other and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication.§ \n※We＊re consultants,§ Foval says, ※so we＊re not the official entity and so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts.§ \nHe adds: \nThe thing that we have to watch is making sure there is a double blind between the actual campaign and the actual DNC and what we＊re doing. There＊s a double blind there. So they can plausibly deny that they knew anything about it. \nThe Clinton campaign ※is fully in it,§ veteran left-wing strategist Robert Creamer confirms on hidden camera. ※Hillary knows through the chain of command what＊s going on.§ \nO＊Keefe＊s group, Project Veritas Action Fund, filed a formal complaint against the Clinton campaign with the Federal Election Commission last week. \nThe complaint states that Project Veritas: \nuncovered a criminal conspiracy where, in the words of Scott Foval, ＆The way it works is: The [Hillary for America] campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays The Foval Group, The Foval Group goes and executes ＃ on the ground.＊ This has been done in a manner to evade federal election law and violating coordinated expenditures rules. \nThe complaint also accuses Priorities USA Action, Alliance for Retired Americans, Americans United for Change, and the Democratic National Committee of accepting ※prohibited and excessive contributions in the form of coordinated expenditures§ contrary to federal law and regulations. \nThe first undercover video O＊Keefe released sent shock waves through the political community. \nIn that video , released Oct. 17, we learned that the frequent outbursts of violence at Republican candidate Trump＊s campaign rallies have been orchestrated and paid for by Clinton＊s campaign. \nThe idea was to foment violent at Trump rallies in order to create the false impression that his campaign and supporters were violent crazy people and at the same time provide evidence to support the Left＊s predetermined narrative that the billionaire businessman is a dangerous fascist. \nSuch behavior constitutes terrorism, Austin Bay writes at the Observer : \nCreamer ran what amounts to a domestic U.S. political terror and propaganda operation dedicated to undermining the 2016 U.S. presidential election〞※rigging the election,§ to use the current term. [＃] \nThe election rigging scheme he commanded relies on street thuggery. That means physical fear〞terror〞is a core component of Americans United for Change＊s crooked enterprise. Street thuggery is very low-level terrorism, but it is a type of terrorism nonetheless and it is wrong to call it otherwise. Hardboy muscle, bottles and two by fours are street thuggery＊s kinetics. Bottles and baseball bats are not Al Qaeda＊s high explosives〞but they incite fear and when they crack heads they cause casualties. People bleed. Street thuggery as an arm of politics is violent, criminalized politics on an ugly downward slope to much worse, the worse including lynchings and pogroms. If you don＊t think street thuggery is terror then consider Kristalnacht. \nAnd O＊Keefe isn＊t finished with the Hillary Clinton campaign yet. \n※Our lawyers won't let us release all our @HillaryClinton & DNC footage[,]§O'Keefe tweeted Tuesday. ※For those demanding full raw [footage], be VERY careful what you wish for.§",

    "text": "Hillary Clinton Tops \"Islamist Money in Politics\" List   \nThere are some very dubious awards out there that you just don't want to win. Being one of the top recipients of Islamic money in politics certainly tops that list. Hillary Clinton likes to complain about dark money. This is as dark as money gets. As the Middle East Forum's research shows . \nHillary Clinton tops the list, raking in $41,165 from prominent Islamists. This includes $19,249 from senior officials of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates on November 15, 2014. \nFor example, Mrs. Clinton has accepted $3,900 from former CAIR vice-chairman Ahmad Al-Akhras, who has defended numerous Islamists in Ohio indicted 每 and later convicted 每 on terrorism charges. \nAmong other current presidential candidates, Jill Stein has accepted $250. Donald Trump and Gary Johnson have not received any Islamist money. \nOther top recent recipients of money from the enemy include Rep. Keith Ellison ($17,370) and Rep. Andre Carson ($13,225). \nThe top ten list includes nine Democrats, one independent (Sen. Bernie Sanders accepted $9,285), and no Republicans. \nI don't think that's too surprising to anyone. Though you have to feel sorry for Jill Stein. She hates Israel and announced she wouldn't have killed Osama bin Laden. What's a girl gotta do to get ahead on Jihad Street anyway?",

    "text": "Wife of FBI Official Investigating Hillary Got $500K from Hillary Allied PAC October 27, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nThe system is broken. It's deeply corrupted by insider politics . The situation at the center of power has reached the point of utter unaccountability. Insider politics function as a shadow government. That needs to change. Restoring America requires dismantling much of the Federal government not only for Constitutional reasons, but because it's a simple matter of saving the Republic. \nHillary Clinton headlined a major fundraiser for a political action committee shortly before the group steered nearly $500,000 to the wife of the FBI official who oversaw the Clinton email investigation, DailyMail.com has learned. \nClinton's ties to the Common Good VA - a Virginia state PAC run by Clinton's long-time friend and advisor Terry McAuliffe, its governor - came under scrutiny this week after the Wall Street Journal reported that the group donated heavily to the state senate campaign of Jill McCabe. \nHer husband Andrew McCabe led the FBI investigation into Clinton's emails. \nAndrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI, told the Wall Street Journal that he complied with federal ethics rules and was not promoted to lead the Clinton probe until months after his wife's unsuccessful state senate bid ended. \nCommon Good VA was the largest single donor to Jill McCabe's campaign, election records show, giving her $467,000 between June and October of 2015. \nShe was the third-largest recipient of money from the group, which can only contribute to Virginia state candidates. \nHer campaign also received an additional $207,788 from the Democratic Party of Virginia, a group over which McAuliffe exerts significant control. Combined, the money made up nearly one-third of her total funding. \nNow McCabe, a pediatrician, suddenly decided to run for public office. Unopposed. That was certainly nice of the Dems to not only put a first timer unopposed, but to throw piles and piles of cash at her. And some of that cash was coming from a key former Clinton Foundation man at the center of the latest Foundation scandal. \nAlthough Common Good VA is only allowed to fund state-level candidates, many of its largest donations came from outside of Virginia 每 including $50,000 from Clinton Foundation official Doug Band in New York, $100,000 from Clinton loyalist Robert Johnson in Maryland, and $10,000 from Clinton mega-donor Stephen Cloobeck in Nevada. \nIn the following months, Common Good VA received several major donations from other close Clinton associates, including $100,000 from Bill Clinton's business partner Ron Burkle in California and $50,000 from Ready for Hillary's finance committee member Leonard Lauder in New York. \nThere are basic conflicts here. Someone this linked to the Clinton network should never have been investigating Hillary regardless of the dates and timing. But this is exactly what happened with Benghazi.",

    "title": "Against Hillary's Malevolent Matriarchy",
    "text": "What feminists can learn from Melania Trump. October 28, 2016 Ilana Mercer \nIn recent interviews, Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump, observed wryly that almost every malicious, lie-filled article about herself or he husband was written by a ＃ female. Indeed, women seem to have a particular stake in bringing Mr. Trump down. \nThe contrast between Mrs. Trump and the many histrionic shrews prosecuting her husband is stark. In both her interviews with CNN's condescending Anderson Cooper and Fox News's Ainsley Earhardt, Mrs. Trump was the embodiment of \"strength.\" \nWhen a liberal woman declares she's a strong woman (usually uttered in a tart-like, staccato inflection), she's using a clich谷. Look at her actions. You'll see that \"strong\" to liberal distaff means kicking and screaming until she brings others into compliance with her worldview and ways. \nA \"strong\" liberal woman is one who hammers you about your obligation to fork-out for her Trojans and her Trivora. And if birth control fails our liberated libertine, then you're on the hook for her abortions and abortifacients. And don't dare doubt any of the intemperate charges leveled by this prototype liberal succubus against a man, any man. To doubt her is to harm her. \nIt was not without significance that Hillary Clinton＊s first general election speech, in June, was before Planned Parenthood. At the time, media buried the story of one named Rajiv K. Fernando , who had donated to the Clinton Foundation and was given a seat as Hillary＊s nuclear weapons advisor. Watching this, I was thinking endemic corruption, the $19 trillion debt, the dire jobs report, the terrifying prospect of negative interest rates and the fate of savers. But Hillary and her gyno-brigade in media and across the country were cheering for a universal right to taxpayer-paid dilation and curettage (D&C). \nMelania Trump, on the other hand, is authentically strong. \nIn her refusal to impart salacious tell-all tidbits to interviewers, in the way she guards her privacy and that of her family; in her serene, gracious, and beautiful manners and bearing〞Mrs. Trump exemplifies a European woman's good breeding. She's a class act. Her enemies are the cultural underclass. \nNor does Mrs. Trump display any of the histrionics about men exhibited by her American counterparts. There are images on the Internet of presidents being inappropriate with women. In particular, you can watch a grainy YouTube clip of Barack Obama appearing to be showing off his crotch to giggling female reporters. In another, the president, with France's Nicolas Sarkozy, is eying the shapely behind of a young woman passing by. Much to media chagrin, Melania refused to get worked up about the 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which her husband engaged in locker-room talk. \nMen will be men. If they're not saying it; they're thinking it. \nMore material than her mien were Melania Trump's words of reason. On the Soviet-style witch-hunt launched against her husband with media mediation, she said this: ※All sexual assault allegations should be handled in a court of law. To accuse someone, man or woman, without evidence is damaging and unfair.§ This was the exact verdict of famed defense attorney Tom Mesereau, about the Bill Cosby pile-on. Quit the feeding frenzy. Give the man his due process. Investigate the women, counseled Mesereau, Esq., at the time. \nThe very embodiment of the malevolent liberal matriarchy rising is the sainted Michelle Obama. The First Lady was lauded for an unhinged anti-Trump address to the nation's women. In a world where Americans have been beheaded on camera, women raped en masse on Europe's streets, and Christians exterminated in the Middle East〞the First Lady bewailed being \"shaken\" to her shallow core by raunchy words. \"I can't stop thinking about it,\" groaned Michelle about Mr. Trump's Access Hollywood indiscretion. It \"has shaken me to my core in a way I could not have predicted.\" \nThe ritualistic decapitation on the altar of a Catholic priest by Muslim migrants in France: That's something \"I can't stop thinking about.\" The machine-gunning of five Macy's shoppers and employees by a Turkish Muslim immigrant (Arcan Cetin), in my neck of the woods: That \"has shaken me to my core in a way I could not have predicted.\" Again, Mrs. Obama's pitiful case against Mr. Trump has strengthened nothing but her drama-queen credentials. \nCandidate Clinton crowed that Mrs. Obama's long whinge for women was a \"compelling and strong case about the stakes in the election, about who we are as Americans.\" Indeed, the implicit case Michelle put to women is this: a mammoth national debt, a shrinking job market, rising lawlessness and racial strife, an annual intake of mostly Third-World immigrants exceeding 3 million, the dangers to life and limb of importing more Islam: fuhgeddaboudit. What counts, whimpered Michelle Obama, voice trembling〞yes, Mrs. Obama almost brought herself to tears〞was to ferret out microaggression, and find a safe-place to hunker down. \nAs I write, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has stormed a stage somewhere for Hillary Clinton. Phony Pocahontas is hollering about the power of \"nasty women\" to immiserate. Clinton and Warren make for a resentful, domineering, power-hungry pair, who＊ve made it big in life through the use of state power. The human backdrop to their displays of female force invariably looks the same. \nWhereas Trump rallies are packed with hope-filled, beaming faces; a Clinton-Warren affair is festooned with malevolent-looking, aggrieved women and their frightened, low-T houseboys. The background music: enfeebled squeaking courtesy of a female pop ※singer§ like Katy Perry, whose out-of-tune yelps and bedroom whispers would be unheard, if not for the marvel of Auto-Tune. (Auto-Tune is the ※holy grail of recording§ that ※corrects intonation problems in vocals or solo instruments, in real time, without distortion or artifacts.§ It was invented by a male engineer.) \nShudder. \nIf this melodramatic, neurotic message is the voice of America's women〞and legions of Republican women have seconded it〞then count me with HER, with Melania.",

    "text": "Hillary Clinton Seeks Even More Unfit Secretary of State Than Her October 28, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nHaving never read any medieval German folk tales, Hillary Clinton is counting her chickens before they've hatched and preparing to hand out jobs that no one has handed her to hand out. She's busy planning her fantasy cabinet for her fantasy administration. \nAnd her big pick makes sense. \nReportedly she would like to make Joe Biden the Secretary of State. Biden is the obvious choice. He's arrogant, dumb and brimming with bright ideas like just giving Iran money or splitting Iraq into little pieces. Obviously this wouldn't be a competency pick. The last time we had someone qualified as Secretary of State was during President Bush's time in office. \nThen Democrats decided they would give the job as a consolation prize to failed presidential candidates. Because our foreign policy is just that important. \nAnd who could be counted on to make an even bigger mess than Hillary Clinton or John Kerry... Joe Biden. It's a perfect plan. If you want a fall guy to blame everything on, they don't come any more obvious than Joe Biden. \nAnd if you want someone shadowed by the soft bigotry of low expectations, you've gotta go Joe. \nJoe Biden could accidentally start WW3 and everyone would shrug and say, \"That's just Joe.",

    "text": "Hillary's Secretary of State After 9/11: \"Send a Check for $200 Million to Iran\"   \nWe're talking about \"Tehran Joe\" Biden of course who is good pals with the Iran Lobby. Biden is reportedly Hillary's fantasy cabinet pick for Secretary of State. Because the Democrats have decided that Secretary of State is a job too important to be trusted to experienced diplomats, but should instead be reserved strictly as a consolation prize for failed presidential candidates. \nHere's a flashback on Biden's views . \nDemocratic vice-presidential candidate Joe Biden was quoted Monday as telling senior Israeli officials behind closed doors that the Jewish state will have to reconcile itself to a nuclear Iran. In the unsourced report, Army Radio also quoted Biden as saying that he opposed \"opening a additional military and diplomatic front.\" Army Radio said Israeli officials expressed \"amazement\" over the remarks attributed to him. \"Israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of Iran,\" Army Radio quoted Biden as telling the unnamed officials. \nBiden's people loudly denied the report, but he had a history of being tight w ith the Iran Lobby. \nSome might call it reaching out to American Muslims. But to many Iranians living in California, a fund-raiser for Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.) at the home of a prominent pro-Iran lobbyist on Feb. 19 sent a wrongheaded message to the ruling clerics in Tehran. \n\"When we learned that Sen. Biden was planning to hold a fund-raiser at the California home of Dr. Sadegh Namazi-khah, we immediately contacted his office to express our dismay,\" a prominent Iranian-American activist tells Insight. Why dismay? \n\"Dr. Namazi-khah is well-known in the Los Angeles area for his support of the ruling clerical regime in Tehran and is one of the regime's leading unofficial lobbyists in America. We thought that Sen. Biden might not know his background. Getting the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to appear at this event will certainly be seen by the regime in Tehran as a show of support.\" \nOn the eve of the fund-raiser, which brought an estimated $30,000 into Biden's re-election coffers, a Biden staffer told the activist that the senator's staff \"had all the facts necessary to make a decision,\" and he was planning to attend the fund-raiser despite the protests. \nSeveral participants who paid to attend the event tell Insight that Biden arrived at 8 p.m., stayed until 11 and delivered a sweeping condemnation of President George W. Bush's \"Axis of Evil\" formula. \nAs Senator, Biden was not only undermining Bush, but fundraising off it at the home of supporters of a terrorist enemy state. \nBiden also impressed many of those present with his friendly attitude toward the Islamic Republic of Iran. The senator said that \"Iran always wanted to be an ally of the United States and to have good relations with the U.S.,\" according to Housang Dadgostar, a prominent lawyer. \"As Iranian-Americans, we don't want anything to happen to the Iranian government or to the Iranian people as a result of this war on terrorism,\" says Mohsen Movaghar, a Los Angeles businessman. Both men belong to the 70-member board of directors of Namazi-khah's Iranian Muslim Association of North America (IMAN). \nNamazi-khah denied any official contact with the Iranian government. But he tells Insight that he regularly travels to Iran 〞 something many expatriates do 〞 and that he actively supports \"moderates\" within the ruling clergy, such as Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, in their efforts to bring reform to the Islamic system. \nNamazi-khah and other IMAN board members say Biden's office contacted them to inquire if they would hold a private fund-raiser for the senator, who is up for re-election this year, after meeting with them at a pro-Tehran gala in New York last December. That event was sponsored by the American-Iranian Council (AIC), a pro-regime lobbying group trying to get Congress and the Bush administration to lift the trade embargo on Iran. \nBut Biden had the perfect post 9/11 reaction . \nAfter September 11th, Biden Suggested Sending $200 Million To Iran, \"No Strings Attached,\" As A Gesture Of Good Faith To The Arab World. \n\"At the Tuesday-morning meeting with committee staffers, Biden launches into a stream-of-consciousness monologue about what his committee should be doing, before he finally admits the obvious: 'I'm groping here.' Then he hits on an idea: America needs to show the Arab world that we're not bent on its destruction. \n'Seems to me this would be a good time to send, no strings attached, a check for $200 million to Iran' Biden declares. \nHe surveys the table with raised eyebrows, a How do ya like that? look on his face.\" \nTraitor says what?",

    "text": "Weiner Sexting of 15-Year-Old Girl Leads to New FBI Investigation of Hillary Emails   \nThe giant flaming garbage dump that is Clintonworld is offering up a wonderful new development sure to excite anyone who wanted to combine the Weiner scandal and the Hillary email scandal. \nYes Virginia, you can now have both of them in one. Like peanut butter and jelly or shampoo and conditioner in one, they've been merged into one horrible stinking landfill for your entertainment and the downfall of the republic. \nThe FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails 每 apparently during the probe of former Rep. Anthony Weiner＊s sexting 每 in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election. \nFBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter to top members of Congress Friday that the bureau has ※learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.§ \nComey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced ※in connection with an unrelated case.§ \nAn FBI source, though, confirmed to Fox News that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced Rep. Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman. The New York Times first reported on the Weiner investigation connection, noting the FBI had been probing texts Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl. \nAs Donald Trump and congressional Republicans seized on the FBI＊s decision, interim Democratic Party leader Donna Brazile simply tweeted, ※Good grief,§ after the news of the Anthony Weiner connection broke. \nCan't argue with her there. \nIt would be hilarious if Anthony Weiner and thereby Huma Abedin led to the downfall of Hillary's lifelong ambition. You just know someone is going to \"commit suicide\" in a D.C. park. \nBut does anyone in the Democratic Party really look forward to 4 to 8 years of this? This is how big of a mess Hillary is now. We've reached the point where her ongoing email scandal is now intertwined with a sexting investigation of a 15-year-old girl. And that's just during the election.",

    "text": "Obama's DOJ Hasn't Approved Warrant for FBI of New Hillary Emails   \nLynch and Obama's corrupted DOJ have switched to overtly undermining the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton. Remember those Hillary emails that have come up in the Weiner investigation? \nAs of Saturday night, the FBI had still not gotten approval from the Justice Department for a warrant that would allow agency officials to read any of the newly discovered Abedin emails, and therefore are still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen. \n※We do not have a warrant,§ a senior law enforcement official said. ※Discussions are under way [between the FBI and the Justice Department] as to the best way to move forward.§ \nThis is Michael Isikoff so the spin is an attack on Comey. Though if Comey couldn't get Lynch to sign off on a warrant, the public announcement could very well have been his way of pressuring the DOJ to do the right thing. Now that the emails are an election issue, the only way to move forward is to allow the FBI to review them. \nBut the Dems and the media are currently attacking Comey and the Isikoff piece is a typical example. Rather than tell the truth that the DOJ is obstructing the Hillary investigation, it's smearing the FBI instead. As so many have pointed out, imagine if Nixon had been a Democrat. This is the way the media would have covered Watergate. \nMeanwhile the Dems are also screaming that Comey tell them about the emails that they refuse to grant him access to.",

And Congress is meant to be kept in the dark. \nAttorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates disagreed with FBI Director James Comey's decision to notify Congress about his bureau's review of emails potentially related to Hillary Clinton's personal server, law enforcement officials familiar with the discussion said. \nThere was no direct confrontation between Lynch or Yates and Comey. Instead, the disagreements were conveyed to Comey by Justice Department staff, who advised the FBI chief his letter would be against department policy to not comment on investigations close to an election, the officials said. \nIt is in line with policy though for Lynch to have met with Bill Clinton. \nBut yes, a Hillary backer disagreed with a course of action damaging to her candidate. \nComeydecided to disregard their concerns and sent the letter Friday anyway, shaking the presidential race 11 days before the election and nearly four months after the FBI chief said he wouldn't recommend criminal charges over the Democratic nominee's use of the server. \nThe officials acknowledged there was little Lynch and Yates could do given the fallout over Lynch's controversial meeting over the summer with former President Bill Clinton. \nNote how the media is spinning this as Comey's drastic course of action while Lynch is just being a responsible public servant. The default assumption is that Comey is in the wrong for providing information to one of the major branches of government and the greater public.",

Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act. \n※It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,§ said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. ※It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.§ \nIt's silly grandstanding and seems easy enough to dismiss.Except that bizarre and unlikely tactics, no longer are. There was outrage over MoveOn's attack on Petraeus and even most Dems thought that it was unhelpful. This attack on Comey I suspect will meet with little criticism. Some Dems will consider it a helpful preemptive move even though with his track record, Comey is as likely to hurt Hillary as he is himself.",

    "text": "Meet Hillary Clinton＊s Secretary of State Send a $200 million check to Iran. October 31, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nDaniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \nSeptember 11, 2001 has come and gone. Countless bodies lie scattered in fragments around where two of the country＊s tallest skyscrapers once stood. Some have burned to ash. Others had their throats slashed by Islamic terrorists. Still others fought and died on a plane to prevent another Islamic terror attack from taking place. \nBut Joe has an idea. Joe is a guy with lots of big ideas and this one is a real doozy. \nThe Senator from Delaware has come a long way since his days as a sixties shyster drumming up business in Wilmington. His formerly bald head is covered in hair so shiny is gleams under neon lights. His teeth are capped and shine almost as brightly. After a generation holding down a squeaky seat in the Senate, seniority makes him a man to be reckoned with. And therefore a man to be listened to. \nEven if you wish he would shut up. \n※I＊m groping here,§ Joe says. For once he isn＊t referring to his notorious habits with women that will go on to make him the star of countless viral photographs, massaging, squeezing, caressing. Instead he＊s talking about foreign policy. The Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has no clue. \nJoe is worried that the Muslims will think badly of us after they murdered thousands of us. And he has a plan to make them feel better. \n※Seems to me this would be a good time to send, no strings attached, a check for $200 million to Iran,§ Senator Joe Biden says. \nThe remark isn＊t quite as random as it seems. The Senator from Delaware, a state not known for its large Muslim or Iranian population, has a friendly relationship with the Iran Lobby. That relationship will only grow friendlier during the Bush era as he attacks America and appeases its enemies. \nIranian-Americans who hate the Jihadist government that has taken over their country and oppressed the Persian people are outraged when he attends a fundraiser at a pro-Iranian lobbyist＊s home in California while treasonously attacking his own government for naming Iran one of the members of the ＆Axis of Evil＊. \nJoe＊s usual Amtrak obsession wouldn＊t get him in the door in California, but treason, hair plugs and capped teeth make him a big hit outside Delaware. And Joe remains very fond of Iran. \nHe informs Israeli officials that ※Israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of Iran.\" And that＊s all the way back in ＊08 before the deal that puts Iran on the path to a Shiite bomb was a nuclear twinkle in Obama＊s eye and a radioactive itch in Hillary＊s socks. \nThat was a big year for Biden. It was his first and biggest shot at the big chair in the White House. Joe had tried it in ＊88 and was stomped by Dukakis, of all people, after being caught plagiarizing a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock. ＊08 got him a useless position in the White House as a consolation prize. \nThis time around Joe Biden is expected to get the same consolation prize from Hillary Clinton that she got from Barack Obama; the office of Secretary of State of the United States. \nOf all the jobs that Joe Biden wants and is utterly unfit for, Amtrak train engineer, secret agent and the guy in charge of counting all the money at the bar, it＊s hard to think of one that he＊s less fit for. \nJoe Biden blamed Darfur on the Gingrich Revolution. He fell in love with the Taliban. \n\"The Taliban per se is not our enemy,\" Joe insisted. \"There is not a single statement that the president has ever made in any of our policy assertions that the Taliban is our enemy.\" \nHe suggested that 95% of the Taliban were probably okay and only 5% were ※incorrigible§. Most of the Taliban, he seemed to think, were, like Joe Biden, just in it for the money. \nBut Joe Biden has a soft spot for Islamic terrorists whether they＊re the Shiite Jihadists of Iran or the Sunni Jihadists of the Taliban. Joe loves all the terrorists of the world and the terrorists love him back. \nIt wasn＊t that long ago that we were being lectured to by the media on Bush＊s ruination of relations with the rest of the world. If Biden were to become Secretary of State, he would become the third Democratic presidential campaign loser to get the job as a consolation prize for his failures as a politician. The last time a professional held down the job would have been the Bush administration. \nAnd yet, perversely, each ※loser§ Secretary has been more incompetent than the last. Hillary＊s disastrous time as Secretary of State could only be exceeded by John Kerry who gave away everything to the Russians and who was contradicted by the White House so many times it would have humiliated a lesser man. Or just any man. The only loser who could follow two class acts like that was Joe Biden. \nJoe Biden＊s amateur diplomacy has been one disaster after another. Even his visit to Israel, a friendly ally not known for fractious political visits by American politicians, became an international incident with Biden sulking in his room while Hillary yelled at Prime Minister Netanyahu for 45 minutes over the phone. But somehow Biden, with his gift for appeasing Iran and the Taliban, alienates allies. \nJust this year, Joe Biden launched yet another attack on Israel. A cynic might almost think that Tehran Joe loves Islamic terrorists and hates those who resist them and fight against them. \nBiden has claimed that terrorism is not an existential threat. He accused President Bush of being ※short-sighted§ for using the military to fight Islamic terrorists. He argued that the perception that we want to stay in Iraq helps Al Qaeda. Some years later, his administration＊s decision to pull out led to the rise of ISIS. He called for closing Gitmo while insisting that it had ※become the greatest propaganda tool that exists for recruiting of terrorists around the world.§ \nSenator Joe Biden was a voice for appeasement. Vice President Joe Biden was part of an administration that empowered and unleashed the malignant power of Islamic terror. Secretary of State Joe Biden would be able to act out his worst fantasies. He could even write that check to Iran. Though the Obama-Biden era has seen cash transfers to Iran that make Joe＊s $200 million check seem like chump change. \nHillary Clinton＊s rise doesn＊t just mean that she will be making big decisions. It will mean that Joe Biden will have gone from a Wilmington shyster to running the foreign policy of a country he has betrayed.",

    "text": "Hillary Clinton and the President＊s ' Longer Game .' At home and abroad, a nation less affluent, less free, and far less secure. October 31, 2016 Lloyd Billingsley \nThe President of the United States, the most powerful man in the world, used a pseudonym to communicate with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on her private, unsecured email server. As Andrew McCarthy contended , that was the reason the FBI declined to prosecute Clinton, because the president would have been part of the same action, and that wouldn＊t be politically correct. \nThe current president of the United States is also on record that, contrary to custom, he will linger in Washington DC for a few years. Wherever he chooses to live, the email intrigue suggests continuing back-channel communications with Hillary Clinton, should she become president. That invites a look at what the man the New York Times dubbed ※Obama＊s narrator,§ the White House adviser who sat closest to the president and signed off on his every word, had to say about the president＊s vision of the future. \n※Few of the decisions he had made would satisfy the politics of the moment,§ David Axelrod explained in his massive 2015 Believer . ※But at home and abroad, Obama was playing a longer game.§ As he explained in Columbia, Missouri, on October 30, 2008, ※We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.§ \nIf this man was a liberal, as Barry Rubin wondered in Silent Revolution: How the Left Rose to Political Power and Cultural Dominance , why did he see a need fundamentally to transform a nation shaped by liberals such as Franklin Roosevelt with his New Deal and Lyndon Johnson with his Great Society? He saw the need because he was not a liberal but a lifelong leftist radical. \nAs David Horowitz explained in Volume 7 of the Black Book of the American Left , the president was ※born, bred and trained in the progressive movement.§ His mentors were ※Communists and their progressive successors,§ so no wonder he presided over ※the institutionalizing of the policies of the left in government§ for eight years. What that means in practical terms is becoming painfully evident. \nThe economy remains sluggish and under Obamacare, the president＊s signature plan, premiums are skyrocketing . This suggests that, as many believe, Obamacare was simply a demolition plan. In the ※longer game,§ designated successor Hillary Clinton will impose government monopoly healthcare, what some candidates erroneously call ※socialized medicine.§ \nAs Rubin noted, the goal of the left is ※to convince Americans the exact opposite of what their experience proved: that the country had fundamentally failed and the old leftist solutions were the answer.§ The result ※may be a very long-term and even permanent change of the United States into something else, a nation far less affluent and far less free.§ And far less secure, as David Axelrod also indicates. \nVladimir Putin makes an appearance in Believer but Obama＊s narrator does not outline Putin＊s background in the KGB. The believer includes nothing about Putin＊s role in East Germany, a Stalinist police state that walled in its subjects and shot those attempting to escape. The narrator avoids Putin＊s belief that the breakup of the Soviet Union was ※the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.§ \nIn Believer , Putin tells the president, ※You are a highly educated man. I come from the security sector.§ The believer then asks the president for his assessment of Putin. \n※He＊s smart, tough, clear about his interests and without a trace of sentimentality,§ the president says. That is not very strong language for a KGB veteran and expansionist autocrat. \nIn his narrator＊s account, the president uses the word ※motherf",

    "text": "Is Hillary Panicking Over the FBI and Weiner Emails?   \nThese past few days have seen a major shift in the Clinton tactics. During the original investigation, the Clinton campaign and its political and media allies launched attacks at Republicans for \"wasting time\" investigating Hillary, but did not attack the FBI. It misrepresented FBI statements, but it certainly did not target investigators in the way we're seeing now. \nBut now we have open hostilities between Lynch at the DOJ and the FBI. We have the Clinton campaign circulating a letter attacking the FBI. We have countless media hit pieces aimed at the FBI. \nThe obvious question is why. The Clinton campaign kept its cool, at least to some degree, before. It certainly didn't begin an ill-advised campaign against the FBI. That's the kind of tactic that may play to your core base, but alienates everyone else. That is to say everyone who isn't in the media. \nSo what's going on here? \n1. The Clintons thought they were done. It's close to the election. So they're lashing out. It's typically paranoid and nasty behavior by the Clintons. Hillary tried playing humble. She tried apologizing. But a moment ago, her victory seemed inevitable, and now she's in a state of fury at having it put at risk. \n2. There is something in those emails that genuinely frightens the Clinton campaign. Which is why it took the crazy risk of going after the FBI with both barrels. It's desperate to smear the FBI as much as possible in order to neutralize any revelations or even potential charges. The attacks are a warning to treat Hillary with kid gloves again... or else. \nThe first is plausible. To a degree. But for all of Hillary's awkwardness, she didn't lose it in the past. Why is she losing it now? There's no evidence beyond speculation for the latter. And yet the major shift in tactics is rather striking. If the Clinton campaign were panicking, this is what it would look like.",

That was fun. Wasn't it. Now she hit an unfavorability rating high of 60 percent. That's higher than Trump. \nIt also means that the candidate who claims she's going to bring Americans together is disliked by most of the country . \nClinton is seen unfavorably by 60 percent of likely voters in the latest results, a new high. Trump is seen unfavorably by essentially as many -- 58 percent. Marking the depth of these views, 49 percent see Clinton \"strongly\" unfavorably, and 48 percent say the same about Trump 每- unusual levels of strong sentiment. \nThe extent of partisan antipathy in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, is remarkable: Ninety-seven percent of Trump supporters see Clinton unfavorably; 90 percent, strongly so. Ninety-five percent of Clinton supporters see Trump unfavorably -每 again, 90 percent strongly so. \nBut remember Hillary is \"inevitable\". \nNow the Clinton campaign has decided to go after the FBI under the assumption that people like Hillary more than the FBI. That may be a slight misjudgment. And by slight, I mean huge. Because not only is the FBI more popular than Hillary, so are major landfills, UFO cattle mutilations and a number of international war criminals.",

This is Donna Brazile who was brought in to replace her to bring back integrity to the DNC. Since Brazile is another Clinton loyalist, that was never going to happen. \nBut the latest leak reveals that Brazile had passed along a second debate question to Hillary. All this just emphasizes how fraudulent and rigged the whole debate process was. \nAnother leaked email has emerged showing Democratic National Committee boss and former CNN contributor Donna Brazile sharing a debate question in advance with the Hillary Clinton campaign -- despite Brazile's persistent claims to the contrary. \nCNN announced in a statement soon after the email became public Monday that Brazile had tendered her resignation and the network accepted it on Oct. 14, days after the controversy over Brazile tipping off the Clinton campaign initially broke. \nAccording to documents released Monday by WikiLeaks, Brazile sent Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri an email titled, ※One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash,§ the night before the March 6 CNN primary debate in Flint, Mich. \n※Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint,§ Brazile wrote. \nThe following night, Lee-Anne Walters, a mom whose twin boys stopped growing and whose daughter lost her hair during the Flint water contamination crisis, posed a question to both Clinton, the eventual Democratic presidential nominee, and her primary opponent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \nClinton responded with a lengthy answer that moderator Anderson Cooper had to twice interrupt in an attempt to keep to the agreed-upon time limit. \nHow pervasive is this kind of thing in the process? We're getting a snapshot of how Clinton's people rigged the process and faked the results to favor them at every turn.",

    "text": "Time: Investigating Hillary is an Attack on All Women November 1, 2016 \nGood morning. It's Tuesday. \nWho's up for another silly attempt to claim that Hillary Clinton is only being investigated for her rogue email setup because she's a woman? This gem comes from Robin Lakoff, a Berkeley professor in sustained incoherence and special pleading. \nHillary Clinton＊s Emailgate Is an Attack on Women \n'It's not about emails; it's about public communication by a woman＊ \nI am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It＊s us. \nThe only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? \nHis name was General Petraeus. Thank you. Have a nice day. \nClinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she＊s doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. \nThat escalated quickly. And incoherently. Also I'm pretty sure it's not the 20s or whatever decade Robin is parodying or channeling. But yes, Hillary Clinton is only in this mess because she's a woman. It has nothing to do with anything else. That must be why Albright and Rice weren't in the center of similar scandals. \nIf the candidate were male, there would be no scolding and no ※scandal.§ Those very ideas would be absurd. Men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech. In theory, so do women, but that, as the creationists like to say, is only a theory. \nEmailing classified information on your server to avoid transparency regulations is not free speech. It's illegal for both public officials of both genders. \nBut here＊s Hillary Rodham Clinton, the very public stand-in for all bossy, uppity and ambitious women. Here are her emails. And since it＊s a woman, doing what decent women should never do〞engaging in high-level public communication〞well, there must be something wrong with that, even if we can＊t quite find that something. \nIllegally... emailing... classified... information.",

It plummets to infinite depths of slime, mold and rotting carrion. This is just another day in Clintonworld . \nJohn Podesta, who draws no salary from the campaign, is making $7,000 per month from the Sandler Foundation, run by Herb Sandler, Politico reported. \nThe Sandlers ran World Savings Bank, which was sold to Wachovia in 2006 for $25.5 billion and which was accused of offering adjustable-rate mortgages that contributed to the housing collapse. \nSaturday Night Live got into trouble when it depicted the Sandlers as people who should be shot. Time Magazine listed them as one of 25 people to blame for the financial crisis. \nIn the early 1980s, the Sandlers' World Savings Bank became the first to sell a tricky home loan called the option ARM. And they pushed the mortgage, which offered several ways to back-load your loan and thereby reduce your early payments, with increasing zeal and misleading advertisements over the next two decades. The couple pocketed $2.3 billion when they sold their bank to Wachovia in 2006. But losses on World Savings' loan portfolio led to the implosion of Wachovia, which was sold under duress late last year to Wells Fargo. \n\nNotorious right wing comedy show Saturday Night Live also featured the Sandlers \nOn October 4, 2008, however, Saturday Night Live aired a skit in which the Sandlers were depicted as predatory lenders. Under their names, SNL placed the caption ※people who should be shot.§ Compounding the Sandlers＊ negative press was a Time magazine list that identified them as two of the ※25 people to blame for the financial crisis.§ The New York Times also labeled the Sandlers ※pariahs§ -- and on December 24, 2008, the Times reportedthat their mortgages were the ※Typhoid Mary§ of the housing crisis. On February 15, 2009, CBS＊s 60 minutes also aired a segment that featured the Sandlers＊ World Savings Bank as one of the primary examples of how the mortgage industry had destroyed itself and unleashed an economic collapse.? \nAnd this is whom Hillary's campaign chief is taking cash from.",

    "text": "Lawyer Who Kept Hillary Campaign Chief Out of Jail in DOJ Hillary Probe November 1, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nPeter Kadzik kept Hillary's campaign chief out of jail. And he hopes to do the same for her. \nHillary's people have gone on the warpath against the FBI. Their allies are Obama's political appointees at the DOJ. And this is who is in their corner. \nThe Justice Department official in charge of informing Congress about the newly reactivated Hillary Clinton email probe is a political appointee and former private-practice lawyer who kept Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta ※out of jail,§ lobbied for a tax cheat later pardoned by President Bill Clinton and led the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch. \nPeter Kadzik, who was confirmed as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs in June 2014, represented Podesta in 1998 when independent counsel Kenneth Starr was investigating Podesta for his possible role in helping ex-Bill Clinton intern and mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. \n※Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,§ Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta＊s Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. \nKadzik＊s name has surfaced multiple times in regard to the FBI＊s investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for using a private, homebrewed server. After FBI Director James Comey informed Congress on Thursday the FBI was reviving its inquiry when new evidence linked to a separate investigation was discovered, congressional leaders wrote to the Department of Justice seeking more information. Kadzik replied. \n※We assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,§ Kadzik wrote on Oct. 31. \nKadzik had been an attorney with Dickstein Shapiro LLP for 18 years before he represented Podesta in the Clinton/Lewinsky investigation. He was hired in 2000 as a lobbyist for tax cheat Marc Rich, who was controversially granted a pardon by President Bill Clinton during Clinton＊s final days in office. Kadzik got the job ※because he was ＆trusted by [White House Chief of Staff John] Podesta,＊ and was considered to be a ＆useful person to convey [Marc Rich＊s] arguments to Mr. Podesta,＊§ according to a 2002 House Oversight Committee report. \nMarc Rich? Funny you should mention his name. FBI boss Comey was the prosecutor in that case. And the FBI recently released material from the investigation into that case. \nSo there's a lot of Clinton history coming full circle here.",

    "text": "Hillary Already Planning Fireworks for Victory Celebration November 1, 2016 \nPeople of the United States, your royal family . \nLaw enforcement officials and the FDNY have been told to prepare for a barge-launched pyrotechnic display off Manhattan＊s Javits Center, where Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine will join their supporters for the Nov. 8 vote count, sources said. \nThe aerial detonations would last for two minutes, with the triumphal celebration permitted to start as early as 9:30 p.m. 〞 a mere half-hour after the polls close in New York, sources said. \nFortunately pride has never been known to come before a fall. And hubris is a notoriously positive trait with no negative consequences. That must be why Hillary Clinton is down in the polls and facing yet another investigation while feuding with the FBI. \nCops and firefighters were blown away by Clinton＊s hubris in planning the fireworks display, which would eclipse the shower of blazing sparkles that preceded the balloon drop at July＊s Democratic National Convention. \n※It＊s a little presumptuous of her to plan on winning. I guess she put in for this before Friday,§ one NYPD detective said. \nOthers said the actual election results could put a damper on things, but one firefighter raised the specter of a 2000-style recount and added, ※So what＊s she going to do, put the fireworks on ice?§ \nThe arrogance is truly unchecked.",

    "text": "Lloyd Billingsley \n※Presidential debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton included a third participant: Vladimir Putin, standing in the background, stealthily inserting himself in the process.§ Putin＊s Russia ※uses deniable cyber-hooliganism to actively prank the American political system. And it＊s taking a toll. . . This is the Putin Playbook. Steal, cheat, attack, disrupt, mislead, confuse. If caught, lie and deny.§ And it gets worse. \n※Unfortunately, the Republican presidential nominee reinforces this narrative, referring to a ＆rigged＊ system and an indictable opponent. His outbursts follow years of domestic political discord, where comity is history, crazy seems the new normal, and a sitting president can be heckled with ＆You lie!＊§ \nAll told, the piece reads like a Clinton press release, but it＊s actually ※Putin＊s powerful playbook: Hack, steal, disrupt, mislead, confuse,§ in the October 30, Sacramento Bee , two days after the Comey email bombshell. The author is Markos Kounalakis, billed as ※a senior fellow at Central European University and visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.§ That doesn＊t quite capture the man and his connections with the Clintons, which have shown up in Wikileaks. \nMr. Kounalakis＊ author line fails to reveal that he is married to Eleni Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis, daughter of real-estate tycoon Angelo Tsakopoulos. According to Greek USA Reporter , Angelo is a ※top political donor to the Clintons as well as the Democratic Party,§ whose ※donations to former President Bill Clinton were rewarded with a night in the prestigious Lincoln Bedroom.§ In 2013 Tsakopoulos, ※confirmed that Hillary Clinton will seek the Democratic nomination in the next Presidential election.§ \nAngelo＊s daughter Eleni, a prot谷g谷 of Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Boxer , raised more than $1 million for Hillary Clinton in 2008 , and that money found its reward. On January 7, 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton swore in Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis as U.S. Ambassador to Hungary. In that capacity , she condemned Wikileaks for releasing secret diplomatic cables, but declined comment on the authenticity of the material. Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis served as ambassador until 2013 but as Wikileaks confirms, she continued as a key Clinton supporter doing her best to beat back a presidential run by Joe Biden. \nIn a June 11, 2015 email, Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis tells John Podesta that a Bay Area bagman ※swears Biden is running. He said he took him on Air Force Two, and he＊s getting emails.§ Last July, Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis emailed Clinton confidant Jake Sullivan that ※HRC indicated her view that it would be best to avoid Grexit§ and a July 9, 2015 email to Sullivan, John Podesta and Huma Abedin, she supports ※terms that will allow Greece to stay in the Eurozone.§ \nOn October 11, 2015, Tsakopoulos Kounalakis emailed Podesta that ※there is a Greek American love fest going on with Joe Biden, very boy-club.§ The same day she emailed Podesta and Huma Abedin that ※we had a David Brock dinner with Annie Karni from Politico. She asked to use four quotes from me (see attached). I told her the first two could be with attribution, and the second two without.§ \nAs the emails to John Podesta and Humba Abedin reveal, ※Ambassador Eleni Kounalakis,§ as she styles herself, remains part of Hillary Clinton＊s inner circle. Tellingly, the McClatchy-Tribune newspapers that run her husband＊s columns, do not acknowledge the strong Clinton connection. \nThe New York Times proclaimed Kounalakis a ※White Knight§ for rescuing Washington Monthly , where he served as publisher and teamed with editor Paul Glastris. This tandem made the publication a ※progressive must-read,§ according to Clinton strategist James Carville. Kounalakis reported for Newsweek in East Germany and ran their bureau in Prague. He also worked in Moscow for NBC Radio and Mutual news. \nKounalakis＊ books include Hope Is a Tattered Flag: Voices for the Post-Bush Era , with Peter Laufer, and Beyond Spin: the Power of Strategic Corporate Journalism with Drew Banks and Kim Daus. It remains something of a mystery how the leftist Kounalakis became a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, known for strong conservative writers and scholars such as Thomas Sowell, Victor Davis Hanson, and Bruce Thornton. \nOnly one time, as this writer recalls, has Kounalakis acknowledged in print his wife＊s strong Clinton connections. Even after the Wikileaks revelations, and with a presidential election only days away, Kounalakis did not acknowledge his wife＊s key role in HRC＊s inner circle with John Podesta and Huma Abedin. His October 30 Sacramento Bee piece suggests Markos is right at home in those circles. \nKounalakis attacks ※the Republican presidential nominee,§ implying that he is ※crazy,§ and a tool of the evil Putin. On the other hand, the Clinton email scandal gets zero attention and the author piles on the ad copy: ※American society has made great strides in LGBTQ rights, women＊s rights and minority rights, and has a relatively strong and resilient globally innovative economy.§ \nThe author gives readers good cause to regard this article as pure Clinton campaign propaganda from a camouflaged Clinton crony. Maybe Markos will join his wife, Huma Abedin, and John Podesta in the Wikileaks revelations. For many observers, the issue is not where the leaks came from but whether the revelations are true and authentic. If Markos Kounalakis believes they are bogus, maybe he can write about what＊s in the real ones.",

Not the usual kind of lies. The lies about corruption and greed. The pretense that she agrees with whomever she's talking to at any given time. It's the stupid lies. The ridiculous lies. The lies only a crazy person would tell. \n\nThis is a stupid lie that took all of 6 seconds to be exposed. Hillary's own book mentions that she wasn't in New York City. She was enough of a public figure that the lie would never hold up. \nSo why tell it? \nThis isn't the first time Hillary Clinton got caught senselessly telling stupid lies. There was the famous airport under fire incident. There was her name and Chelsea jogging on 9/11 and negotiating peace in Northern Ireland. Politicians often lie, but Hillary Clinton is unique in telling senseless lies that seem to have no rational purpose except to get caught.",

Neither are millennials. \nAfter Sunday night＊s polls closed, black vot ers accounted for 16 percent of the in-person early vote ballots cast. And that included five previous days of in-person early voting. \nBut in 2012, in just two days of in-person early voting, blacks cast 25 percent of those early ballots, according to Dan Smith, a University of Florida political science professor who published some of the early voting data on his must-read Election Smith blog. \nDue to such strong African-American turnout after the beginning of in-person early voting in 2012, Democrats began outpacing Republicans in total ballots cast before Election Day, by about 10,000. This year, though, Republicans still cling to their own lead of about 9,000. As of Monday morning about 3.7 million absentee and in-person early ballots had been cast, 40.5 percent of them by Republicans and 40.2 percent by Democrats. \nHillary is getting Latino support, largely due to the immigration debate, but she just doesn't have the hot sauce draw that her husband and Obama did.

Their pretext was that Hillary Clinton is supposed to have immunity from the FBI before the election. And Comey was being irresponsible and violating protocol, the Hatch Act and the Thou Shalt Not Impede the Electoral Prospects of Democrats mandate. \nMost Americans have the good sense to think that this is a bunch of rubbish . \nHillary Clinton and President Obama are outraged about the F.B.I.director James Comey＊s decision to disclose further inquiries into her handling of confidential email, but are the American people? \nShockingly the American people are not all that outraged about the FBI investigating a corrupt criminal... not nearly as much as the corrupt criminal and her political allies are. \nIn an online Morning Consult poll of approximately 3,200 registered voters, only 19 percent agreed with the statement that prosecutors should wait until after Election Day to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials. Instead,60 percent agreed that prosecutors should be able to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials close to Election Day even if it might affect the election. (Another 21 percent said they don＊t know or had no opinion.) \nIn news that's shocking to the Times, the American people are once again out of step with their left-wing masters. \nWhen the investigation into Mrs. Clinton was mentioned before the question, partisans differed by almost 50 percentage points in their attitude toward pre-election disclosures, which were endorsed by 83 percent of Republicans but just 34 percent of Democrats 〞 an even larger gap than observed with the generic prompt. By contrast, mentioning Mr. Trump＊s foundation eliminated the gap between the parties in support for publicizing investigations, which was backed by 57 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of Republicans. \nOne might conclude that Republicans are the more ethical and honest party.",

Doris had her face cut up so badly from the beatings that when she tried to drink, water would pour out of her lacerated cheeks.§ \n※On Mother＊s Day they allowed family visits,§ recalls Manuela Calvo from exile today.§ But as our mothers and sons and daughters were watching, we were beaten with rubber hoses and high-pressure hoses were turned on us, knocking all of us the ground floor and rolling us around as the guards laughed and our loved-ones screamed helplessly.§ \n※When female guards couldn＊t handle us male guards were called in for more brutal beatings. I saw teen-aged girls beaten savagely, their bones broken, their mouths bleeding ,§ recalls Polita Grau. \nThousands upon thousands of Cuban women have also drowned, died of thirst or have been eaten alive by sharks attempting to flee the regime founded by the folks who recently endorsed Hillary Clinton. This from a nation formerly richer than half the nations of Europe and deluged by immigrants from same. \nRemember how Donald Trump was taken greatly to task by the media for not quickly repudiating David Duke＊s (so-called) endorsement? \nWell, we certainly look for the media to take Hillary Clinton similarly to task for not instantly repudiating the endorsement of mass-jailing, mass-torturing, mass-murdering Stalinists. \nAfter all, recalling the ※sticks and stones can break my bones§ riddle of our childhood, David Duke＊s crimes§ consist of words (※hate-speech.§) Whereas the (literal) sticks, stones--and chains, manacles, bullwhips and bullets--of the fine folks so enthusiastically endorsing Hillary Clinton have caused untold suffering to hundreds of thousands of people.",

    "text": "David Frum: Hillary is a Patriot Who Will Protect the Constitution November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nIf David Frum had suggested that Hillary Clinton used to play for the Patriots, I would have found his argument a little more credible than claiming that she is a patriot. \nBut she is a patriot. She will uphold the sovereignty and independence of the United States. She will defend allies. She will execute the laws with reasonable impartiality. She may bend some rules for her own and her supporters＊ advantage. She will not outright defy legality altogether. Above all, she can govern herself; the first indispensable qualification for governing others. \nThis is under an Atlantic piece headlined, \"The Conservative Case for Hillary\" which also contends, \"Why support a candidate who rejects your preferences and offends your opinions? Don＊t do it for her〞do it for the republic, and the Constitution.\" \nThe trouble with this line of argument is that Hillary's own agenda includes a rejection of the First and Second Amendment. It's a rather unusual way to support the Constitution by destroying it. \nThen there's the whole Hillary is a quarterback for the New England Patriots business. Who has ever accused Hillary Clinton of being a patriot? How was this patriotism manifested? In Benghazi? In Iran? In Russia? I'll skip over the \"outright defy legality altogether\" argument. Though it's certainly sad that this is now considered some sort of high water mark. \nBut can Hillary govern herself? Is the compulsive liar who can't help shouting, \"I was in New York on 9/11\" really capable of governing herself? \n\"I am voting to defend Americans' profoundest shared commitment: a commitment to norms and rules that today protect my rights under a president I don＊t favor, and that will tomorrow do the same service for you\". \nUnless you make a movie about Mohammed.",

    "text": "Nigerian Novelist Wonders Why Everyone Loves Hillary November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nWhy does everyone love Hillary Clinton? It's hard to say. Her unfavorable ratings have hit 60%. That makes her more popular than \n1. The Bubonic Plague \n2. ObamaCare \n3. Osama bin Laden's corpse \nIt's not much to go on. But the Atlantic decided to run a piece by Chimamanda Adichie titled,\"Why Is Hillary Clinton So Widely Loved?\" \nYour response to seeing the name Chimamanda Adichie was probably huh. Unless you're a gender studies student at an Ivy. In which case you know exactly who she is and love her. Chimamanda Adichie is a Nigerian novelist whose \"We should all be feminists\" is big in those circles. \nThe Clinton campaign is unbearably awkward and this panegyric by Adichie was an obvious attempt to channel some of that canned Obama poetry. And like most Hillary branding, it fails badly. \nThere are howlers like, \"There are millions who admire the tapestry of Hillary Clinton＊s past\" and \"There are people who, when Hillary Clinton becomes the first woman to be president of the United States, will weep from joy\". It's not quite a hymn to Comrade Stalin. Nor is it getting there by any means except a tow truck. \nAnd then there's the phrasing. Oh the phrasing. \"Hillary Clinton was guilty immediately when she stepped into the view of the American public as the first lady of Arkansas.\" \nThis is an awkward attempt to channel that Obama poetry, but instead it reads like a DVD manual badly translated from the Japanese. \nThe Atlantic piece is full of lines that straddle the border between tin-eared propagandistic cliche and just bad writing. \n\"She was a lawyer full of dreams: \n\"She was guilty of not being a traditional first lady. She offended the old patriarchal order.\" \nThen there's the theme of the article, which is to just deny reality. \n\"A conservative writer labeled her a congenital liar when she was first lady, and the label stuck because it was repeated over and over〞and it was a convenient label to harness misogyny. If she was a liar, then the hostility she engendered could not possibly be because she was a first lady who refused to be still and silent. ※Liar＊ has re-emerged during this election even though Politifact, a respected source of information about politicians, has certified that she is more honest than most politicians\" \nThe perfect timing for that defense would have been not right after Hillary Clinton shouted at a rally that she had been in New York on 9/11. But don't worry. Hillary is more honest than most politicians. A site supporting her said so. \n\" Other words have been repeated over and over, with no context, until they have begun to breathe and thrum with life. Especially ※emails.§ The press coverage of ※emails§ has become an unclear morass where ※emails§ must mean something terrible, if only because of how often it is invoked.\" \nHow about \"Classified emails\"? Or \"illegal server\"? Or \"violation of regulations dealing with the handling of classified material\"? That's got lots of context. Or \"cover-up\". \n\"The people who love Hillary Clinton know that the IT system at the State Department is old and stodgy, nothing like a Blackberry＊s smooth whirl. Hillary Clinton was used to her Blackberry, and wanted to keep using it when she became secretary of state.\" \nPeople who love Hillary know that she love high tech Blackberry. Hillary love Blackberry. She is a lawyer full of dreams who fights for the children of migrant workers and loves their smooth whirl. Politifact thrums with life. Says her Blackberry is more honest than the iPhone. Hillary has many dreams of thrumming Blackberries whirling smoothly that offend the traditional stodgy patriarchal order IT system. \n\"The American conservative media saw an opportunity to blow the ※emails§ story out of proportion, soon followed, almost bashfully, by the rest of the American media\" \nIs that how it works in Nigeria? Because that's not how it works in America. \n\"There is no objective basis on which to equate Hillary Clinton to her opponent.\" \nThey're both mammals? They need oxygen to live? They're better writers than Chimamanda Adichie. \n\"The people who love Hillary Clinton see the failings of the general American media, where news entertains rather than informs. They bristle when benign stories about her are covered with an ominous tone\" \nThey bristle and they hug their Blackberry and weep for they fear that the patriarchal stodgy IT systems will prevent Hillary from being the thrumming First Lady of North America. \n\"They know that she is a bit too careful, but they understand that she has to be, that she cannot afford spontaneity.\" \nYou would think with all those six figure speeches, she could. afford a little \n\"her actions so falsely magnified, that she leaned into caution, wrapped herself in a kind of caution that sometimes makes her appear stilted \" \nAnd wrapped in her caution, her whirling Blackberry in one hand, she bristled at the public, retracting her quills and occasionally hissing in an informed fashion for the children of migrant workers who admired the tapestry of her past. \n\"There are millions of Americans who do not have the self-indulgent expectation that a politician be perfect. They are frustrated that Hillary Clinton is allowed no complexity. \" \nGet Beyonce on the phone. I think Adichie has got another hit.",

    "text": "Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \nIn the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. \nThe word ※unprecedented§ has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it＊s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. \nBut that＊s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary＊s opponent in this election. \nThe FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary＊s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn＊t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \nThe FBI＊s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI＊s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \nThe covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama＊s DOJ people has gone explosively public. \nThe New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, ※James Comey Role Recalls Hoover＊s FBI, Fairly or Not§ practically admits up front that it＊s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey＊s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \nJames Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the ※vast right wing conspiracy§ was a stretch. \nCountless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what＊s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \nSenator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \nIf James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \nNot too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner＊s computer? \nEither Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he＊s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary＊s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \nThe only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \nAnd it＊s an interesting question. \nHillary＊s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \nPretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \nThere are two possible explanations. \nHillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \nBut the other explanation is that her people panicked. \nGoing to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It＊s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that＊s not hubris, it＊s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \nDuring the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the ※positive§ Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \nThere＊s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. \nThe Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it＊s gone all in on fighting the FBI. It＊s an unprecedented step born of fear. It＊s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. \nClinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. \nYou can smell the fear. \nThe FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It＊s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that＊s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn＊t how you react to smoke. It＊s how you respond to a fire. \nThe misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. \nThe Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don＊t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. \nThe campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It＊s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It＊s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. \nHillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she＊s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.",

    "text": "Why Time Magazine＊s Joe Klein Is So Wrong About Hillary Clinton Rebutting the absurd claims of my namesake. November 4, 2016 Joseph Klein \nTime Magazine＊s Joe Klein has just penned an article entitled ※Why Hillary Clinton Is the Only Choice to Keep America Great.§ I feel duty bound to respond to at least the most absurd of the comments made by namesake and author of Primary Colors, the novel based on about Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign in 1992. \nThe other Joe Klein laments that Hillary has been so ※severely damaged in the course of the 30-year battering she＊s received at the hands of extremists and the media.§ Sorry, but Hillary＊s wounds are self-inflicted. Her lies, greed and corruption go back decades and have now reached a crescendo with the dual scandals of her use of a private server for State Department business while she was Secretary of State and of the pay-for-play Clinton Foundation. \n※There is one part of Trump that is indisputably real: his ego,§ the other Joe Klein wrote, as if Hillary were the epitome of humility and grace. \n※Those who would put Clinton＊s failings in the same league as Trump＊s depravities are delusional,§ declared Klein. I agree with his statement, but for precisely the opposite reason that he advances. Trump did not abuse a public office for personal gain. He did not ※hand pick§ (Hillary＊s word) an ambassador to serve in one of the most dangerous countries in the world and then never respond to his multiple requests for enhanced security, let alone pick up the phone and contact Ambassador Chris Stevens directly. \"The government was not able to save four lives, to keep four lives safe. How can you keep a country safe?\" asked Stevens＊ former fianc谷 in a rhetorical question that Hillary would be unable to answer. Trump did not lie to the families of those slain in Benghazi, as Hillary did. Trump did not put national security at risk by using a private server for government e-mails in order to evade the Freedom of Information Act, as Hillary did. \nIn short, anyone who thinks that Hillary＊s proven record of recklessness, mendacity, and indifference is not more troubling by several orders of magnitude than Trump＊s ※depravities§ is ※delusional.§ \nThe other Joe Klein complains that Trump deals in ※stereotypes§ - ※the blacks,§ ※the Hispanics,§ ※the Muslims,§ ※the women§ and, yes, even ※the veterans.§ Yet much of Hillary＊s pitch is gender-based. Elect her because she is a woman. And she attacks millions of people who support her opponent with vile epithets 每 ※deplorable,§ ※racist,§ ※sexist,§ ※homophobic,§ ※xenophobic,§ ※Islamaphobic,§ and 每 for good measure - ※irredeemable.§ \nThe other Joe Klein charges that Trump is ※about all that has gone wrong in our society, and nothing of what has gone right.§ To paraphrase Bill Clinton, that would depend on what your definitions of ※wrong§ and ※right§ are. Is Hillary Clinton really right when she parrots Black Lives Matter＊s stereotypical attacks on what she herself has characterized as white ※privilege§ and ※systemic racism§ in this country? Is she right when she leaps to conclusions about police ※brutality§ aimed against African-Americans before the evidence in specific cases is carefully examined? I don＊t think so. \nHillary also represents the political correctness and anti-religious bigotry of the secular left elite that many Americans believe are what truly have gone wrong in our society. At the Women in the World Summit last year, for example, Hillary said that in order to fully secure the reproductive rights of women, ※deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.§ Hillary demeaned the sincerely held religious belief in the sanctity of life held by millions of Americans, reminiscent of President Obama＊s contemptuous ＆clinging to religion＊ quote back in 2008. \nHillary＊s key supporters and top aides have targeted the Catholic Church in particular for their notion of progressive reform. ※There needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church,§ wrote Sandy Newman, president of Voices for Progress, in an e-mail to Clinton＊s campaign chairman John Podesta. In response, Podesta picked up on the ※spring§ theme. He wrote, ※We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this. But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up.§ \nWhen Time Magazine＊s Joe Klein talks about what is right or wrong in American society, he should get out of his Washington D.C. bubble more often and actually speak with the American people about their day-to-day concerns. Even if Hillary Clinton ends up winning the election, the country will remain divided and she will have no mandate whatsoever to advance her progressive agenda.",

Even while the rest of the Clinton clique is screeching against the FBI for investigating Hillary like bats from the nether regions of left-wing hell, Mitchell is sticking to the old spin. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary . Close your eyes and say it three times. The FBI is not investigating Hillary. It's not. It's not. \nIn a complete state of denial on Thursday, MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell interrupted live coverage of Donald Trump speaking at a Florida campaign rally to supposedly ※fact-check§ the candidate for citing a bombshell report that the FBI was conducting an extensive investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s e-mail and charitable foundation scandals. \nMitchell refused to accept reality: ※Just a lot of fact-checking to do. She's not under criminal investigation. In fact, it's not an investigation. It's just a review of the e-mails. She did not lie to the FBI, according to James Comey. There was no grounds to prosecute her. So there are no lies, there＊s no criminality.§ She fretted: ※I don't know even where to start....but I mean, we have to put it in some context.§ \nThe context is that defending Hillary Clinton has become a mental illness. \nBut as I wrote earlier this week, fact checking has become a media term for insisting on the primacy of its alternate reality even when it flies in the face of actual reality. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary. Anyone who believes that is probably some sort of right-winger who listens to what the FBI actually says, rather than what NBC says that the FBI says.",

    "text": "Obama Should Just Pardon Hillary for Every Conceivable Crime November 4, 2016 \nDon't look now, but #PardonHer talk is growing. \nJust as the Clinton campaign and its media allies rage against the FBI, some are looking for a pardon solution. And a way to spin that pardon as something other than a straight admission of guilt. How about political reconciliation and a way to defy those mean Republicans and take the issue of all the crimes that Hillary committed off the table? Here you go. \nIt does not take much clairvoyance to predict that Clinton's most strident opponents may seek to extend the use criminal investigations as a political tactic to undermine her presidency if she wins the election next week. That prospect triggers a startling idea: Should President Barack Obamasimply pardon Clinton if she wins the election?... \nA presidential pardon could short circuit some of this maneuvering. The Constitution gives the president the power \"to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States,\" and it could be used here. The public is aware of the allegations against Clinton, yet she has continued to lead in election polls. If voters choose her for the presidency, their decision that the allegations are not disqualifying deserves respect. A presidential pardon could ratify that assessment. \nYes, but what should Obama pardon Hillary Clinton for? Corruption, bribery, abuse of classified information? How about everything. Let's just print up a list of every possible crime and pardon Hillary for all of them. It would save time, energy and raise Hillary above the law. It would be a clear statement that she could get away with murder. \nLiterally.",

    "text": "by Colaborama \nWe have been very, very suspicious of Donald Trump since he began his political run. \nMany believed he was an outsider who was our ※only hope§ to tame the US federal government beast. But it has become very clear he is not. \nFirst, Wikileaks showed that Killary herself actually approved Trump to be her competitor. According to an email sent from an assistant at the Clinton campaign, Hillary was aware that Trump was going to run before the political process was fully underway. \nClinton advised the mainstream media to push his legitimacy as a ※pied piper§ candidate because she realized, after looking at the poll numbers, that she wouldn＊t stand a chance at winning the presidency against any of the establishment republicans without making them ※pied pipers§ 每 it just so happened that Donald was the easiest to play the role considering his long history of friendship with the Clintons. \nIn addition, the mainstream media was more than complicit in creating a narrative that the 2016 presidential elections were about Hillary Clinton vs Donald Trump from the get go. \nBut, barely reported in the media, was that after the 3rd presidential debate, Clinton and Trump went out for a night on the town together＃ and where they went is of great interest. \nThey went to an annual Jesuit function which is usually full of New World Order types. \nTHE JESUITS \nOne of the more interesting things that occurred right at the end of the Jubilee year in early October, was that the Jesuits installed a new Superior General, with the date to commence being actually at midnight on the end of Jubilee. \nWe found this interesting because there is plenty of evidence that the Jesuits are at least one major arm of what you can call the illuminati. \nIn fact, the Jesuits were founded in Spain by what various reports call ※crypto Jews§ 每 those who are Jewish but pretending to be Catholic. Certainly at that time in Spain it was safer not to be a Jew. \nEven Wikipedia, which wouldn＊t recognize a conspiracy if it were directly presented by its participants has this to say about the Jesuits: \n＃ In the first 30 years of the existence of the Society of Jesus there were many Jesuit conversos (Catholic-convert Jews) including the second Father General Diego Lainez ＃ The original founder Ignatius ＃ said that he, ※would take it as a special grace from our Lord to come from Jewish lineage.§ \nAt the beginning of the Al Smith dinner party after Cardinal Dolan was introduced, a joke was even made by a speaker that ※everyone in attendance is doing their part in supporting their charitable efforts and that it couldn＊t be done without the support of many of the other devoted ※Catholics§ on stage like Henry Kissinger, Howard Rubenstein, and Mort Zuckerman§ 每 all of whom are obviously Jewish so this remark was naturally met with a lot of laughter＃ \nIn fact, an extraordinary amount of controversy swirls around Jesuits. They are said to constitute the ※Black Church§ and thus adhere to the same Satanic religion as the world＊s elite bankers supposedly hold. \nThe leader of the Jesuit order is commonly recognized in conspiratorial circles as the ※Black Pope§ whose signature staff is a crooked cross. Historically, the Jesuit Order has been seen as one that shirks no crime in expanding the power of the Church. \nLest this sound entirely outrageous, one must note that the Jesuits are, for instance, the inventors of concentration camps, which they established in Paraguay in order to incarcerate and then torture the native indians of the area. \nBut the litany of attributed Jesuit evil is even darker than that according to those who believe in the order＊s continued malicious pursuit. The supposed founder of the Bavarian-based Illuminati, Adam Weishaupt, was a Jesuit. \nIn fact, the order is reputed to have been deeply involved in the Illuminati＊s initial expansion, and chances are it is still deeply involved. \nOne more thing that highlights the evil of the Jesuits is their extreme oath of induction which all superiors must take in order to be elevated to the higher rungs of the organization. This is taken from the book Subterranean Rome by Carlos Didier, translated from the French, and published in New York in 1843 and reads in part, \n※＃promise and declare that I will, when opportunity present, make and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, as I am directed to do, to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex or condition; and that I will hang, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants＊ heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever their execrable race. That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poniard or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus＃§ \nOne of the most poignant quotes regarding the malevolence of the Jesuits comes from Marquis de LaFayette 1757-1834; who was a French statesman and general who served in the American Continental Army under the command of General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War. \nHis quote is as follows: \n※It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country 每 the United States of America 每 are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe.§ \nTHE BIG BASH \nWhen evaluating Jesuit behavior and influence, please keep in mind that both Donald Trump and Hillary＊s VP, Tim Kaine, are Jesuit educated. And it should be of GREAT interest, therefore, that practically on the eve of the US election, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton partied the night away at a Jesuit function that included such prominent Jesuit-trained attendees as Henry Kissinger. \nNot only did the two not look like sworn enemies＃ they looked like two star crossed lovers going to their first prom. \nWe have long held to our stance that Killary will be the next President of the US. The amount of vote rigging, murders and shenanigans to even get her to where she is so far has been tremendous＃ and it won＊t stop. \nThat said, if by some fluke, and the Diebold machines malfunction or people in the US wake up slightly and Donald Trump gets elected＃ it is pretty clear they are on the same team and, as we＊ve said previously, nothing major will change. \nSo, if you were hoping that this election could change things in the US＃ get over that hope right now. It might change things, but only for the much, much worse. \nThis charade is being played right in front of everyone＊s eyes and most do not understand what is happening or why jokes like the ※Catholic§ joke is actually funny to these elite people. \nThey are laughing at the peasants stupidity and lack of understanding, not because the men mentioned are Jews＃ anyone with half a brain knows that. \nBut while they laugh, we＊ll be laughing all the way to the bank ourselves. Just because these sick people are formulating diabolical plans to enslave humanity doesn＊t mean we can＊t profit from their planned chaos. It＊s better than sitting back in ignorance and making nothing. \nOur analysis of these elite＊s occult timelines which began with the Shemitah and culminated with the Jubilee, have helped us to accumulate around a 200% collective return on our portfolio in the last year. \nSubscribe to The Dollar Vigilante newsletter HERE to continue to receive the best insights into the inner workings of groups like the Jesuits and other arms and actions of the world＊s financial elite and how to protect yourself and profit from it. \nThe groundwork for global governance has been laid, don＊t let them blindside you as they attempt to carry out their nefarious plot. Donald Trump even stated at the dinner, ※We＊ve got to come together, not only as a nation, but as a world community.§ \nPromotion of the globalist new world order. \nThey want to keep you ignorant and powerless because after all, knowledge is power. \nEducate yourself by joining the worldwide group of dollar vigilantes who can help you expatriate and offer advice on how to protect yourself by purchasing precious metals, bitcoin and other hard assets here.

    "title": "Missing from Hillary Clinton＊s Email: Saudis Worked with CIA to Create Terror",
    "text": "KURT NIMMO | OCTOBER 24, 2016 \nHillary Clinton＊s email to her current campaign manager John Podesta dated August 17, 2014 implicates Qatar and Saudi Arabia as the main ※logistical and financial§ supporters of the Islamic State. In the email, Clinton recommended the United States use its ※diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia§ to put them ※in a position of balancing policy between their ongoing competition to dominate the Sunni world and the consequences of serious U.S. pressure.§ \nSecretary of State Clinton＊s proposal appears to be a reaction to growing awareness of the role Gulf monarchies have played in supporting and funding not only the Islamic State and al-Nusra but a constellation of jihadi groups in the Middle East. Left unmentioned by Clinton is the fact the United States under a number of administrations has worked closely with the Gulf monarchies to spread Sunni Wahhabism across the Muslim world. \nThe financial elite in the West played a direct role in the spread of Wahhabism. In 1976 Saudi Prince Mohammed al-Faisal established the Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt (FIBE). Several of founding members were leading members of the Muslim Brotherhood, including the ※Blind Sheikh,§ Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman, implicated and in the first World Trade Center bombing in February 1993. The Muslim Brotherhood became an MI6 and later a CIA asset during the covert war and assassination plot against the nationalist pan-Arab leader in Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser. \nFIBE and the rise of Islamic banking following the dramatic increase in oil prices in 1973 are closely associated with neoliberal financial policies and the philosophy of the of the Chicago School of Economics and the monetary prescriptions of the International Monetary Fund. FIBE worked closely with the infamous Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), a renegade bank used to fund covert terrorist activity and launder money, sell illegal weapons, and facilitate the international drug trade. After BCCI crashed and burned in 1991, investigators discovered it held $589 million in ※unrecorded deposits,§ $245 million of which were placed with FIBE. ※BCCI consisted of a complex alliance of intelligence agencies, multinational corporations, weapons dealers, drug traffickers, terrorists, global bankers and high-ranking government officials,§ writes David DeGraw . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood also established the al-Taqwa Bank in 1988. It funded radical Wahabbi groups, including al-Qaeda. The bank was associated with the late Said Ramadan, one of the Muslim Brotherhood＊s top leaders. Ramadan was the son-in-law of Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood. He also helped the Saudi monarchy establish the Muslim World League in 1962. The organization would later fund al-Qaeda and numerous other terror groups. Declassified Swiss documents from the 1960s reveal Ramadan was an asset of the CIA and British intelligence. \n※It＊s no exaggeration to say that Ramadan is the ideological grandfather of Osama bin Laden. But Ramadan, the Muslim Brotherhood, and their Islamist allies might never have been able to plant the seeds that sprouted into al-Qaeda had they not been treated as US allies during the Cold War and had they not received both overt and covert support from Washington,§ writes investigative journalist Robert Dreyfuss . \nIn addition to funding radical Islamic groups, the Saudis helped establish the so-called Safari Club in 1976. The chief instigator of the group was Alexandre de Marenches, head of the French external intelligence service SDECE. Like the BCCI, the Safari Club funded off-the-books terror operations and worked closely with al-Mukhabarat al-A＊amah, the Saudi intelligence organization. Kamal Adham and then his nephew Prince Turki. Adham acted as a channel between Henry Kissinger and Anwar Sadat, the president of Egypt and former member of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Safari Club was run by Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi of Iran-Contra fame. He also had connections to the BCCI. \nAccording to author Joe Trento, the Safari Club preferred working with a rogue faction of the CIA made up of agents close to ex-CIA director George Bush Sr. and decorated CIA officer Theodore Shackley. The ※private, shadow spy organization within§ the CIA, according to Trento, was organized during an effort by the Carter administration to reform the agency following revelations of the Church Committee in the mid-1970s. (See Peter Dale Scott＊s The Road to 9/11: Wealth, Empire, and the Future of America .) \nBush ※cemented strong relations with the intelligence services of both Saudi Arabia and the shah of Iran. He worked closely with Kamal Adham, the head of Saudi intelligence, brother-in-law of King Faisal and an early BCCI insider,§ Scott writes. \nDuring a May 1979 meeting of the globalist Bilderberg Group the British historian Bernard Lewis presented a British-American strategy which ※endorsed the radical Muslim Brotherhood movement behind [Iran＊s] Khomeini, in order to promote balkanization of the entire Muslim Near East along tribal and religious lines. Lewis argued that the West should encourage autonomous groups such as the Kurds, Armenians, Lebanese Maronites, Ethiopian Copts, Azerbaijani Turks, and so forth. The chaos would spread in what he termed an ＆Arc of Crisis,＊ which would spill over into the Muslim regions of the Soviet Union.§ (See F. William Engdahl, A Century of War: Anglo-American Oil Politics and the New World Order . London: Pluto Press, 2004: page 172.) \nThe previous year the CIA began training Islamic militants in Pakistan as part of an effort to destabilize neighboring Afghanistan and draw in the Soviet Union. Robert Gates, who would become CIA director and later secretary of defense under Obama, recalled a meeting held on March 30, 1979 where Under Secretary of Defense Walter Slocumbe proposed ※sucking the Soviets into a Vietnamese quagmire.§ President Carter formally approved covert aid to the CIA supported Afghan Mujahideen in July. (See Robert Gates, From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider＊s Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War . New York: Simon & Schuster, 2007: page 145.) \n※The CIA became the grand coordinator: purchasing or arranging the manufacture of Soviet-style weapons from Egypt, China, Poland, Israel and elsewhere, or supplying their own; arranging for military training by Americans, Egyptians, Chinese and Iranians; hitting up Middle-Eastern countries for donations, notably Saudi Arabia which gave many hundreds of millions of dollars in aid each year, totaling probably more than a billion; pressuring and bribing Pakistan-with whom recent American relations had been very poor-to rent out its country as a military staging area and sanctuary; putting the Pakistani Director of Military Operations, Brigadier Mian Mohammad Afzal, onto the CIA payroll to ensure Pakistani cooperation,§ writes Phil Gasper . \nAccording to Dreyfuss, ※America＊s alliance with the Afghan Islamists long predated the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and had its roots in CIA activity in Afghanistan in the 1960s and in the early and mid-1970s. The Afghan jihad spawned civil war in Afghanistan in the late 1980s, gave rise to the Taliban, and got Osama bin Laden started on building Al Qaeda.§ \nThe line between radical Islam in Afghanistan in the 1980s and the Islamic State remains unbroken. There is a direct correlation between al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), and the Islamic State in Iraq that originated with Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn, aka al-Qaeda in Iraq. AQI was the subject of a Pentagon black op and propaganda campaign targeting the Iraqi resistance following Bush＊s invasion in 2003. \nHillary Clinton＊s email makes it appear the Saudi monarchy is primarily responsible for the §logistical and financial§ support of the Islamic State. In fact, the Islamic State is not the monolithic threat it is portrayed as by the government and its media. It is a loose confederation of jihadi groups sharing a similar ideology based in Saudi Wahhabism. Many of those groups are now receiving direct financial and military support from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United States, and others. \nAs secretary of state Clinton spearheaded an effort to arm and train ※moderate§ Syrian jihadists and overthrow the government of Bashar al-Assad. After Obama authorized the CIA effort to train and arm the jihadists in 2013, the agency used Saudi money to finance the project. \nThe New York Times noted in January: ※In addition to Saudi Arabia＊s vast oil reserves and role as the spiritual anchor of the Sunni Muslim world, the long intelligence relationship helps explain why the United States has been reluctant to openly criticize Saudi Arabia for its human rights abuses, its treatment of women and its support for the extreme strain of Islam, Wahhabism, that has inspired many of the very terrorist groups the United States is fighting.§ \nMore accurately, the United States is reluctant to criticize its Wahhabi partner and seriously endanger the neocon-spawned ※Arc of Crisis§ carefully designed to divide and balkanize the Arab and Muslin Middle east. \nHillary Clinton clarified the objective in an email dated November 30, 2015. ※The best way to help Israel deal with Iran＊s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,§ Clinton writes . ※Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel＊s security, it would also ease Israel＊s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.§ \n# # # # Kurt Nimmo, Newsbud Producer & Author, is a writer, editor, producer and researcher based in New Mexico.

    "text": "As usual we will go parse through the disclosure and bring you some of the more notable ones. \n* * * \nIn a February 2012 email from Chelsea Clinton＊s NYU alias, , to Podesta and Mills, Bill and Hillary＊s frustrated daughter once again points out the ※frustration and confusion§ among Clinton Foundation clients in the aftermath of the previously noted scandals plaguing the Clinton consultancy, Teneo: \nOver the past few days a few people from the Foundation have reached out to me frustrated or upset about (fill in the blank largely derived meetings Friday or Monday). I＊ve responded to all w/ essentially the following (ie disintermediating myself, again, emphatically) below. I also called my Dad last night to tell him of my explicit non-involvement and pushing all back to you both and to him as I think that is indeed the right answer. Thanks \n\nSample: Please share any and all concerns, with examples, without pulling punches, with John and Cheryl as appropriate and also if you feel very strongly with my Dad directly. Transitions are always challenging and to get to the right answer its critical that voices are heard and understood, and in the most direct way 每 ie to them without intermediation. Particularly in an effort to move more toward a professionalism and efficiency at the Foundation and for my father 每 and they＊re the decision-makers, my Dad most of all \n* * * \nA February 2015 email from Neera Tanden lashes out at David Brock of the Bonner Group, profiled in this post: ※ Money Laundering Scheme Exposed: 14 Pro-Clinton Super PACs & Non-Profits Implicated .§ As a reminder, the Bonner Group, as we showed last month, may be a money laundering front involving various SuperPACs and non-profit institutions: \n\nIn the email Tanden says that: \n※Brock/Bonner are a nightmare: Really, Suzie Buell isn＊t giving to the superpac? I wonder how that got in this story ※ Big donors holding off making pledges to pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC ※, \nand concludes by saying that ※ Sometimes HRC/WJC have the worst judgement .§ \nIn retrospect, she is right. \n* * * \nSpeaking of ※donor advisor§ Mary Pat Bonner , the following email from March 2009 hints at potential impropriety in shifting money from one democratic donor group to another, the Center for American Progress : \nI have moved all the sussman money from unity ＊09 to cap and am reviewing the others . I will assess it and keep you informed \nSomething else for the DOJ to look into after the elections, perhaps? \n* * * \nAnd then there is this email from August 2015 in which German politician Michael Werz advises John Podesta that Turkish president Erdogan ※is making substantial investments in U.S. to counter opposition (CHP, Kurds, Gulenists etc.) outreach to policymakers§ and the US Government. \nJohn, heard this second hand but more than once. Seems Erdogan faction is making substantial investments in U.S. to counter opposition (CHP, Kurds, Gulenists etc.) outreach to policymakers and USG. Am told that the Erdogan crew also tries to make inroads via donations to Democratic candidates, including yours. Two names that you should be aware of are *Mehmet Celebi* and *Ali Cinar*. Happy to elaborate on the phone, provided you are not shopping at the liquor store. \nThe email : \nThis should perhaps explain why the US has so far done absolutely nothing to halt Erdogan＊s unprecedented crackdown on ※coup plotters§ which has seen as many as 100,000 workers lose their jobs, be arrested, or otherwise removed from Erdogan＊s political opposition.

    "text": "Home ? POLITICS | US NEWS ? DONALD TRUMP CLOSES GAP WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN MICHIGAN DONALD TRUMP CLOSES GAP WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN MICHIGAN 0 SHARES \n[10/27/16] Republican nominee Donald Trump is now within striking distance of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Michigan, a state that has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. \nIn the latest Fox 2 Detroit/Mitchell Poll , Trump trails Clinton by just six points. In the four-way poll, Clinton received 48 percent, Trump received 42 percent, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received 4.5 percent, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 1 percent. Clinton led Trump 50 percent to 44 percent, in the head-to-head. \nFifty-nine percent of polled voters said that jobs and the economy are the most important issues, while 29 percent said that national defense and terrorism were most important. \nA Detroit Free Press/WXYZ-TV poll places Clinton ahead of Trump by 7 points, which is still a significant narrowing compared to previous polls. \nPublic backlash against trade deals like President Barack Obama＊s Tran-Pacific Partnership 每 a deal that Clinton once called ※the gold standard in trade agreements§每 was so fierce that Clinton changed her tune during the Democratic primary where she was defeated by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \n※Across Michigan, Republicans are coming home and taking a united stand against Hillary Clinton＊s radical, open-borders agenda and plan to double-down on failed Obama policies, such as Obamacare. We are also seeing independents, Democrats and union workers saying no to Clinton＊s special interest driven agenda, and yes to Mr. Trump＊s plan to put America first,§ Tim Lineberger, communications director for Trump＊s Michigan campaign team told The Daily Caller News Foundation. \n※Hard working Americans will be voting for change in November because they feel like the system is rigged against them, and they know that Clinton and her cohorts are the ones rigging it,§ Lineberger added. \nClinton was previously caught on tape telling a group of foreign bankers that her dream was a ※hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.§ Trump is also hoping to capitalize on the government＊s recent report, stating that the price of Obamacare premiums are expected to increase an average of 22 percent.

GEORGE SOROS: TRUMP WILL WIN POPULAR VOTE IN ＆LANDSLIDE,＊ HILLARY＊S ELECTORAL VICTORY IS ALREADY ＆A DONE DEAL＊ GEORGE SOROS: TRUMP WILL WIN POPULAR VOTE IN ＆LANDSLIDE,＊ HILLARY＊S ELECTORAL VICTORY IS ALREADY ＆A DONE DEAL＊ 0 SHARES \nEven Republican politicians and former politicians are telling Trump to knock off such talk . \nBut, as usual, Trump＊s shrewdness and defiance of standard political decorum 每 in which the ※opposition§ party merely rolls over and surrenders in the face of Democratic pressure 每 is winning the day. \nNone other than billionaire investor and longtime Democratic supporter George Soros has said that the fix is literally in for the election, in favor of Clinton 每 no matter how much of the popular vote, and from which battleground states, Trump captures. \nAs reported by Top Right News and other outlets, during a recent interview with Bloomberg News , Soros 每 a Democrat mega-donor 每 openly admitted that Trump will win the popular vote in a ※landslide.§ \nHowever, he said that none of that would matter, because a President Hillary Clinton is already a ※done deal.§ \nIn the interview, which is now going viral, Soros says with certainty that Trump will take the popular vote, despite what the polls say now (which are completely rigged to oversample Democrats ), but not the Electoral College, which will go to Clinton. \nWhen the reporter asks if that is already a ※done deal§ 每 that Clinton will be our next president no matter what 每 Soros says ※yes,§ and nods his head. \nIs Soros just making a prediction out of overconfidence? Or does he truly know something most of us don＊t know? \nIn a recent column , Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, says that Soros and Democrats have ※bribed electoral college representatives§ in a bid to ※fix§ the election outcome in favor of Clinton. In truth, that would be the only way it could be done, short of massive voter fraud through electronic balloting, as some reports have already claimed . \nAdams further pointed out that Soros was one of the main money men behind the Black Lives Matter movement, which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country 每 some of which has led to the deaths of several officers already. \nSoros also funds left-wing websites and groups that locate, pay and deploy volunteer ※agitators§ at Trump rallies, to start fights and engage in physical violence against Trump supporters (acts that the establishment media then blames on Trump ). \nBut aren＊t electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that elector＊s district? No, they＊re not. Nine-nine percent of electors have done what they＊re supposed to do throughout our history, but this is no ordinary election \nPer Archives.gov , there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote. Rather, these pledges fall into two categories: State law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political parties. \nIn the past, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution doesn＊t require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please and, therefore, respective political parties may ※extract pledges from electors to vote for the parties＊ nominees,§ Archives.gov notes. Some state laws hold that ※faithless electors§ could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid ballot, and could then be replaced by a substitute elector. \n※The Supreme Court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the Constitution. No Elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged,§ said Archives.gov. \nThe site notes that throughout our history, 99 percent of electors have voted as required. But this is no ordinary time, and it＊s no ordinary election . And Democrats (and the establishment media) have already proven that they will do anything to stop a Trump presidency. Plus, establishment Republicans don＊t want Trump either, so you can bet they wouldn＊t balk at or challenge the buying off of electors. Post navigation",

Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. \nThe tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. \nThe tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton＊s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is ※rigged.§ \nSpeaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). \n※I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,§ said Sen. Clinton. ※And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.§ Post navigation",

WILL BARACK OBAMA DELAY OR SUSPEND THE ELECTION IF HILLARY IS FORCED OUT BY THE NEW FBI EMAIL INVESTIGATION? 0 SHARES \n[10/31/16] MICHAEL SNYDER -Just when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a game changer into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton＊s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails ※did not come from her private server§, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the ※emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry§, and according to some reports there may be ※potentially thousands§ of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? \nLet＊s take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ \nAfter recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ※appear to be pertinent§ to the email probe. \n※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,§ Comey wrote the chairmen. ※I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.§ \nAt this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton＊s closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton＊s Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ \nWe don＊t know what this means yet except that it＊s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that＊s where we are＃ \nIs it a certainty that we won＊t learn before the election? I＊m not sure it＊s a certainty we won＊t learn before the election. \nOne thing is, it＊s possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ \nIf the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? \nIt is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. \nSo those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. \nBut if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year＊s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group＊s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nIt would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. \nIn such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be ※fair§ until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. \nMeanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. \nAnd CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ \nAn artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. \nMogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. \nThe AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. \nWithout Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. \nSo if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. \nAt this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.

    "text": "Home ? POLITICS ? IF HILLARY CLINTON IS CHARGED WITH OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE SHE COULD GO TO PRISON FOR 20 YEARS IF HILLARY CLINTON IS CHARGED WITH OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE SHE COULD GO TO PRISON FOR 20 YEARS 0 SHARES \n[10/31/16] MICHAEL SNYDER -In the world of politics, the cover-up is often worse than the original crime. It was his role in the Watergate cover-up that took down Richard Nixon, and now Hillary Clinton＊s cover-up of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very, very long time. When news broke that the FBI has renewed its investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s emails, it sent shockwaves throughout the political world . But this time around, we aren＊t just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents. I haven＊t heard anyone talking about this, but if the FBI discovers that Hillary Clinton altered, destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the FBI during the original investigation, she could be charged with obstruction of justice. That would immediately end her political career, and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life. \nI have not seen a single news report mention the phrase ※obstruction of justice§ yet, but I am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading. The following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice ＃ \nWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. \nIf Hillary Clinton is sent to prison for 20 years, that would essentially be for the rest of her life. \nI have a feeling that the FBI is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in Huma Abedin＊s emails. But unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before November 8th, because according to the Wall Street Journal there are approximately 650,000 emails to search through＃ \nAs federal agents prepare to scour roughly 650,000 emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of Hillary Clinton ＊s email use, the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the Justice Department over how to investigate the Democratic presidential nominee. \nMetadata found on the laptop used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide, suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that Mrs. Clinton used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter. It will take weeks, at a minimum, to determine whether those messages are work-related from the time Ms. Abedin served with Mrs. Clinton at the State Department; how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the Clinton email probe. \nOf those 650,000 emails, an inside source told Fox News that ※ at least 10,000 § would be of interest to the investigation. \nAt this point, FBI officials have not even begun searching through the emails, because a search warrant has not been secured yet. The following comes from CNN ＃ \nGovernment lawyers haven＊t yet approached Abedin＊s lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search. Sources earlier told CNN that those discussions had begun, but the law enforcement officials now say they have not. \nEither way, government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer, the law enforcement officials said. \nBut the FBI is reportedly already searching a laptop that was co-owned by Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin, and no warrant was necessary for that search because Weiner is cooperating with the FBI. \nMany have been wondering why FBI Director James Comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day. Surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election, and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big. In addition, Comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the FBI. The following is an excerpt from a Daily Mail article that was written by Ed Klein, the author of a recently released New York Times bestseller about the Clintons entitled ※ Guilty As Sin ※＃ \n＆The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn＊t recommend an indictment against Hillary,＊ said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. \n＆Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,＊ said the source. ＆They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.＊ \nAccording to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. \nHe told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. \nSo what happens next? \nIn the most likely scenario, the FBI will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton before the election. This means that we would go into November 8th with this scandal hanging over the Clinton campaign, and that would seem to be very good news for Donald Trump. \nHowever, it is possible that once the FBI starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against Clinton are warranted, and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day. \nIn the unlikely event that does happen, we could actually see Hillary Clinton forced out of the race before November 8th. \nOnce again, this appears to be very unlikely at this point, but it is still possible. \nIf Clinton was forced to step aside, the Democrats would need to come up with a new nominee, and that process would take time. In an article later today on The Most Important News I will reveal who I believe that nominee would be. \nIn such a scenario, the Democrats would desperately need time to get their act together, and so we could actually see Barack Obama attempt to delay or suspend the election . The legality of such a move is highly questionable, but Barack Obama has not allowed a little thing like the U.S. Constitution to stop him in the past. \nThis week is going to be exceedingly interesting 每 that is for sure. \nThe craziest election in modern American history just keeps getting crazier, and I have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead. \nIt sure seems ironic that Anthony Weiner is playing such a central role this late in the story, and I can＊t wait to see what is in store for the season finale.

    "text": "Home ? GUNS ? HILLARY PROMISES END TO VIOLENCE THROUGH CIVILIAN DISARMAMENT HILLARY PROMISES END TO VIOLENCE THROUGH CIVILIAN DISARMAMENT 3 SHARES \n[10/31/16] With just days left before Americans will go to the polls to elect a new president, voters committed to continuing to live under the protections of personal liberty in the Constitution must examine positions taken by the candidates on key issues. \nIn this article, we＊ll look at Hillary Clinton＊s call for civilian disarmament and what Americans could do to prevent this policy from coming to pass, even if Clinton is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. \nOn her campaign website, Clinton makes several unconstitutional promises that would have the effect of disarming millions of Americans and threatening the enjoyment of the right to keep and bear arms of millions more. Here＊s a sample from her list of presidential promises: \nAs president, Hillary will: \nExpand background checks to more gun sales 〞 including by closing the gun show and internet sales loopholes 〞 and strengthen the background check system by getting rid of the so-called ※Charleston Loophole.§ \nTake on the gun lobby by removing the industry＊s sweeping legal protection for illegal and irresponsible actions (which makes it almost impossible for people to hold them accountable), and revoking licenses from dealers who break the law. \nKeep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, other violent criminals, and the severely mentally ill by supporting laws that stop domestic abusers from buying and owning guns, making it a federal crime for someone to intentionally buy a gun for a person prohibited from owning one, and closing the loopholes that allow people suffering from severe mental illness to purchase and own guns. She will also support work to keep military-style weapons off our streets. \nThere are so many constitutionally repugnant statements in these three paragraphs. \nFirst, there is no such thing as a gun show loophole. Here＊s the truth as explained by the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute: \nIf the voters learn the facts about gun shows, they will discover that there is no gun show loophole, no gun show crime problem and no reason to adopt federal legislation whose main effect would be to infringe on First and Second Amendment rights. \nDespite what some media commentators have claimed, existing gun laws apply just as much to gun shows as they do to any other place where guns are sold. Since 1938, persons selling firearms have been required to obtain a federal firearms license. If a dealer sells a gun from a storefront, from a room in his home or from a table at a gun show, the rules are exactly the same: he can get authorization from the FBI for the sale only after the FBI runs its ※instant§ background check (which often takes days to complete). As a result, firearms are the most severely regulated consumer product in the United States 〞 the only product for which FBI permission is required for every single sale. \nSurely Clinton and her advisors are aware of this fact and that they are misrepresenting the situation to uninformed voters, thus their insistence on ※closing the gun show loophole§ becomes nothing less than another attempt to demand the surrender of natural rights in exchange for a ※safer world.§ \nNext, with regard to the creation of ※universal background checks,§ here＊s more from Cato: \nGun-control advocates often claim that 40 percent of annual firearms sales take place today without background checks. The Washington Post ※fact-checker§ has debunked that claim, giving it ※Three Pinocchios.§ The Post noted that the survey data used for the study on which the 40 percent claim is based are more than two decades old, which means they were collected prior to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System becoming operational in 1998. The survey only polled 251 people, and, upon asking whether their gun transfer involved a federally licensed dealer 〞 that is, a federal firearms licensee (FFL) 〞 gave respondents the choice of saying ※probably§ or ※probably not§ in addition to ※yes§ and ※no.§ Post navigation",

    "title": "The Hillary Era is Coming: Worry!",
    "text": "BY ANDREW LEVINE I trust that I am not the only one to have noticed that in rural areas and economically distressed neighborhoods in towns and cities, lawn signs for Donald Trump are everywhere, while Hillary signs are rarer than Teslas and Maseratis. I think I understand the Trump signs: they are cries of defiance. Hillary＊s supporters are harder to figure out. I suspect that most of them would just as soon not advertise their intentions November 8. Even if they think that there is no other way to stop Trump, they understand that, by voting for Hillary, they are embarrassing themselves. Lawn signs apart, the evidence that Trump is kaput is, by now, overwhelming. He seems finally to have done his campaign in 每 to such an extent that even diehard anti-Trump fear mongers concede the inevitability of the Clintons＊ return to the White House. Trump＊s campaign had been on life support for weeks when the pussy grabbing tape surfaced, followed by a seemingly endless stream of women 每 a dozen or so already 〞 accusing the Donald of groping them and worse. Then, in the third debate, Trump announced that he would ※wait and see§ before accepting the legitimacy of a Clinton victory. This seems to have been the final straw for all but the most bona fide ※deplorables.§ And so, the writing is on the wall: Hillary will win just as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow 每 well, not quite, but almost. There is no reason to rejoice in her victory, only in Trump＊s defeat. Hillary＊s supporters are in denial, and even people who know better than to support her for her own sake remain determined to waste their votes by adding to her totals. Apparently, they think that this is a way to send the message that Trumpian ※fascism§ shall not pass. How much better it would be if they would use their votes to build alternatives to the neoliberal perpetual war regime that Hillary and Bill and their co-thinkers have helped fashion! The best chance for that, at this point, is Jill Stein＊s campaign on the Green Party ticket. Stein cannot win, of course; a vote for her is only a protest vote. But there is nothing wrong with that. Hillary needs to know that she has no mandate to end the world ※as we know it,§ and this is one of many ways to convey that message. And even that isn＊t as obvious as it seems . Hillary probably the lesser evil all things considered. But Trump is very likely the less dangerous of the two. The man is an adolescent in a septuagenarian＊s body, with a tendency to act out. But at least he is not a Russophobe or a neocon or a ※humanitarian§ intervener intent on regime change in countries that resist American domination. This would include not only the usual victims, countries incapable of harming the United States militarily, but Russia and China as well. It is relevant too that the supposed lesser evil is a committed neoliberal and a Wall Street toady, and that Trump＊s ※crooked Hillary§ taunts hit the target more often than not. These considerations, and others like them, should cause concern to those who are fine with lesser evil voting in general, but who think that there are thresholds beneath which lesser evil considerations should not apply. There is no need to agonize over these issues, however; not in this case. When Trump became the Republican nominee, lesser evil arguments became moot. This would still be the case even if more voters were not quite so willfully blind to the dangers inherent in Clinton＊s determination to maintain American world domination by any means necessary, and to her fondness for military ※solutions.§ Lesser evil considerations are irrelevant because Trump is and always has been bound to lose to any Democrat, even to her. I have been pressing this point and its corollary 〞 that anti-Trump hysteria is a distraction 每 from Day One. As recently as a month ago, hardly anyone agreed with me. If only I had a dollar for every time I have been taken to task for not seeing the parallels between the Trump phenomenon and the rise of Nazism in the final years of the Weimar Republic! I would be a rich man today. But because it is now recognized that Trump＊s chances of becoming President are, for all practical purposes, nil, no one is pressing that line these days. I used to be out on a limb; I no longer am. It would be only natural to take pleasure in this turn of events, and I would 〞 but for the fact that a Trump defeat implies a Clinton victory. That prospect is, at best, only slightly less nightmarish. Worse, it doesn＊t seem to matter that all but the most flagrant worrywarts now finally concede that there will never be a President Trump. Liberals and centrists and even a few foolish leftists are still going all out for Hillary. From the dead center to the soft left, the consensus view is still that now is a time to boost, not knock, Hillary＊s campaign 〞 especially in the dozen or so states where the Electoral College outcomes could not have been determined years ago with absolute certainty. It is remarkable that so many people cannot let anti-Trump hysteria go; that they are so focused on Trump＊s misogyny, temperamental instability, and narcissistic blather that they don＊t see that the only thing we need fear, where Trump is concerned, is, so to speak, the fear itself. However, in Hillary＊s case, there really is something to fear: that she is about to become the Commander-in-Chief of the most lethal military force in the history of the world. On that point, her supporters are in denial, and even people who know better than to support her for her own sake remain determined to waste their votes by adding to her totals. Apparently, they think that this is a way to send the message that Trumpian ※fascism§ shall not pass. How much better it would be if they would use their votes to build alternatives to the neoliberal perpetual war regime that Hillary and Bill and their co-thinkers have helped fashion! The best chance for that, at this point, is Jill Stein＊s campaign on the Green Party ticket. Stein cannot win, of course; a vote for her is only a protest vote. But there is nothing wrong with that. Hillary needs to know that she has no mandate to end the world ※as we know it,§ and this is one of many ways to convey that message. Pundits who claim otherwise are dead wrong. Those who pile on for Hillary are wasting their votes; protest votes aimed at Hillary are not wasted at all. I would imagine that at least some Trump voters are thinking along similar lines. But the racism, nativism and Islamophobia of their candidate tarnishes the messages their votes will convey. They therefore cannot register with any real clarity. The message protest votes for Stein convey is, on the other hand, as clear and distinct as can be. And if she garners at least five percent of the total votes cast, the Greens will have access to federal funding in future elections, and will have a much easier time gaining ballot access in all fifty states. This would not make for much of a ※political revolution,§ even in Bernie Sanders＊ highly attenuated sense of the term, but it would make future elections less mind-numbing and degrading, and it could ultimately lead to more far-reaching transformations of the political scene. Now that Trump has all but killed off the GOP, the duopoly party system is in jeopardy, and all kinds of political realignments have, at last, become feasible. *** I wasn＊t just being contrarian when I went out on a limb about Trump＊s chances; and my confidence was in no way based on inferences from polling data or statistical extrapolations. Let the blogosphere＊s ※political junkies§ and the corporate media＊s talking heads knock themselves out with that. What they do is useful only for entertaining people who care about the horse race aspect of presidential elections. It is distressing how many Americans indulge in that spectator sport. Most of them are essentially apolitical. I was confident that I was right about Trump＊s chances because I knew that what people tell pollsters when an election seems far off is basically irrelevant for predicting the election＊s outcome. Information about how they and people like them voted in the past is more relevant, but not by much. This is especially true when, as in this case, disdain for one or the other candidate, or for both, is a dispositive factor in many voters＊ minds. I was also fairly sure that, rightly or wrongly, more people fear and loathe Trump than fear and loathe Hillary; and that, if they didn＊t at the outset, they would before long 每 because Trump was all but certain to undermine himself, and because there is so much dirt out there on the Donald＊s sleazy connections and moral turpitude that even God-fearing Republicans, capable of believing almost any nonsense, were bound eventually to be repulsed. I suspected too that Trump never really wanted to be President; that he only got into the race to promote his brand, and because he is an egotist and publicity-hound. Trump hates to lose, however 〞 especially to the likes of Hillary 〞 and so, at some point, he must have decided to give the campaign his all, even if it meant bringing the Trump brand down with him. Should it come to that, I will shed crocodile tears for his brood, Ivanka especially. A worthwhile thing to do in the months ahead would be to work to make that happen; to do everything possible to assure that the damage done to all things Trump will be irreversible. What a delightful irony that would be! There are plenty of Hillary-haters in the Donald＊s base who hate Hillary because they consider her the embodiment of coercive goody-goodyism, or because they think she is disdainful of people like them (people in the ※deplorables§ demographic), or because they think that she is too leftwing. The idea that she is too leftwing is nonsense, of course; she is not nearly leftwing enough. That anyone would think otherwise is a testament to the media＊s ability to shape public perceptions and to the degree of political ignorance rampant in some quarters of the American electorate. But ※vast rightwing conspiracy§ Hillary-haters are spot on right about the rest of it 〞 and two out of three isn＊t bad. Even so, there are better reasons than theirs to dread the prospect of a Clinton presidency. They all have to do with the service Hillary has done, and will go on doing, for the miscreants who control the commanding heights of America＊s and the world＊s capitalist order, and with her untrammeled, ideologically-driven bellicosity. Hillary knows how to game the system; and she and Bill know how to benefit from doing so. But, for all her vaunted ※experience,§ she is clueless about the world. And although she and her fans boast of her ※pragmatism,§ that woman is seriously inept. Most of what she undertakes to do is ill conceived, and nearly all of it turns out badly. In short, the lesser evil, if that is what she is, is a very great evil indeed. It won＊t take long, once she moves back into the White House and starts putting her stamp on the empire＊s depredations, for the scales to fall from the eyes of all but her most gullible supporters. I am even more sure of this than I was of Trump＊s defeat, but I will take even less joy in being proved right again. What lies ahead, with Hillary in control, is too horrible to contemplate.

    "title": "Will FBI Director Comey＊s October Surprise Derail Hillary＊s White House Bid?",
    "text": "Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN H aving closed his earlier investigation into Hillary＊s use of her private email server for classified State Department documents without bringing charges, dismissing indictable evidence, it＊s hard imagining a shift of agency policy now. So what＊s going on? Is FBI Director Comey trying to save face, even at this late stage, having tarnished the reputation of the agency and himself. The fullness of time will show what he has in mind. He faces intense political pressure from key Democrat senators, demanding immediate answers about why he＊s reopening his investigation days before November＊s election, an unprecedented act. .. Senators Patrick Leahy, Dianne Feinstein, Thomas Carper and Ben Cardin wrote Comey , saying: .. ※(N)o later than Monday, 31 October 2016, we request you provide us with more detailed information about the investigative steps being taken, the number of emails involved, and what is being done to determine how many of the emails are duplicative of those already reviewed by the FBI.§ They want Attorney General Loretta Lynch explaining her involvement in Comey＊s action, if any. The Hillary campaign called for ※public answers§ to clarify what new information the FBI discovered. .. After saying that revisiting his decision last July would be unlikely, Comey opted for an October surprise 每 the likes of which Washington hasn＊t seen since the tumultuous end of Nixon＊s tenure. Paul Craig Roberts said he＊s gotten word ※ that the FBI has reopened the Hillary case of her violation of US National Security protocols, not because of the content of the new email releases, but because voter support for Trump seems to be overwhelming, while Hillary has cancelled appearances due to inability to muster a crowd. The popular vote leaves the FBI far out on the limb for its corrupt clearance of Hillary. The agency now has to redeem itself.§ .. How remains to be seen. Like Roberts, I＊m puzzled. Washington power brokers chose Hillary to succeed Obama. Enormous resources, energy, corporate pollsters consistently showing her ahead, and one-sided scoundrel media support have gone into assuring it. .. Have things changed days before November 8? Are power brokers abandoning Hillary this late in the game? The last 48 hours have been breathtaking 每 the stuff Hollywood thrillers are made of. Will Hillary supporters blame Russia for Comey＊s action? One Democrat congressman suggested it. Will Comey be accused of being a Kremlin agent? .. However things unfold in the campaign＊s final days, Trump got a significant boost 每 whether enough for a ※master of suspense§ Alfred Hitchcock ending remains to be seen. My view, right or wrong, remains the same. After going all-out for Hillary throughout months of campaigning, it＊s hard believing power brokers decided otherwise this late in the game 每 unheard of in US electoral politics. .. At the same time, this political season has been unlike any I remember since the 1940s. Nothing ahead will surprise me.

    "text": "One thought on ※ Why Hillary won＊t unleash WWIII § shorty says: October 30, 2016 at 8:01 pm \nSELECT COMMENTS | OVERHEARD (ORIGINALLY ON RUSSIA INSIDER) From time to time we import comments we regard as lucid or thought-provoking to a particular discussion. This is such a thread. Some opinions we agree with, some we don＊t. But they all add an edge to this topic. 〞The Editors \nMMChomek ? 16 hours ago Alright, let＊s sum this up. \nHillary can＊t launch a No fly zone over Syria, because there is already one in place? Well, the point they are trying to make is that they will get rid of the Russian and Syrian air defenses to launch their own ※We can fly-you can＊t-zone§. With force. Hillary expressed her willingness to do this several times already. \nYes, General Dunford said ※we would have to go to war with Syria and Russia§ You kind of left out the followup, where he says ※That is a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I＊m not going to make§ not, ※we can＊t do this§ e.g, he＊s waiting for the order from the commander in chief. \nThis was at the very beginning of the article >She is fully supported by virtually the whole US establishment; a bipartisan, neocon/neoliberalcon, regime change/§humanitarian§ imperialist axis. \nSo WHO is going to stop her? \nand lastly, first finished Sarmat won＊t be slipped inside a silo at least until late 2018 Hillary most likely gets to oval office next February kind of a non-sequitur to even mention it \nSo you basically say ※This is why Hillary won＊t start WWIII§ and then you throw in a bunch of non-arguments and contradictions \n??? \nMike John Elissen MMChomek ? 8 hours ago `and lastly, first finished Sarmat won＊t be slipped inside a silo at least until late 2018 Hillary most likely gets to oval office next February kind of a non-sequitur to even mention it` \nfollowed by `So you basically say ※This is why Hillary won＊t start WWIII§ and then you throw in a bunch of non-arguments and contradictions` Seems to me the only `non-argumentation` is your view on Billary taking control next year and immediately starting WW3. Even for a war-loving US hawk like her, it will take time to start a war with Russia. \nMMChomek Mike John Elissen ? 8 hours ago God, Hillary doesn＊t even need to be president to lobby for war. She＊s been doing exactly that for three straight decades. Now she has full support of entire D.C behind her back. Even as Kjell mentions one or two good, down to earth generals in Pentagon are not going to be enough, when most of their colleagues lobby for spending and interventions hoping to end up as senior advisors for defense contractor giants. Entire DC, even bah, especially the ※progressive think tanks§ (who get funded by things like Lockheed Martin and even Saudi Arabia) is crying for cruise missile strikes on Syria as we speak. \nMike John Elissen MMChomek ? 6 hours ago Your argumentation for calling Escobar`s points `non-arguments` is, or rather was ao the fact HRC takes office in january (not february as you claimed) 2017, and the new Sarmat will be in service in 2018. To change the subject (Clinton&Co warmongering and making profits 每 we all know that) does not change the fact Billary needs time to prepare for a war with Russia. You can call Kjell as a `rescue line` all you want, fact remains your own argumentation is `Non`. \n??? Kjell Hasthi MMChomek ? 16 hours ago 每 Hillary most likely gets to oval office next February Pepe did not say that \nNeil Tana Kjell Hasthi ? 7 hours ago She will. Trump is an idiot and is probably acting that way to drive another agenda because he can＊t be that stupid. The real questions is how serious is all of this to Russia. I think it is very serious. The US has already shown how they manipulate people to wage war against their government, supply them with weapons, call it a civil war, plant false flags to push it over the edge, call it unhumanitarian to open air war options, then invite others to join in on the fun while selling them weapons in the process to do so. They can easily do this to Russia if Syria falls or not. They just need to excite the 20 million muslims in Russia that borders the middle east. I＊d say that Russia is a great risk and should take decisive actions. They could just use air fuel bombs as they are not radioactive but destroy everything in its path like a tactical nuke. To this point, the EU needs to be very worried because they are on the front lines and are sleep walking under the direction of the US who is an ocean away. \nKjell Hasthi MMChomek ? 14 hours ago 每 As I said before, I don＊t believe Trump will win \nThat is naiv as both Hillary and Kaine are unpopular. In Pentagon, almost hated. \nMMChomek Kjell Hasthi ? 14 hours ago How is that possible? She is their major job provider. \nKjell Hasthi MMChomek ? 14 hours ago There are 90 million made redundant Trump is a more attractive candidate for them The polls presented on telly are all manipulated (when compared to independent polls). Hillary is well behind, and she is losing voters these days. The Putin bashing did not save her. \nMMChomek Kjell Hasthi ? 14 hours ago Trump has wowed to pull out of middle east, stop babysitting and subsidizing other NATO members and become buddies with the ※greatest existential threat§ e.g Russia \nHow is he a more attractive candidate for the Pentagon, than Hillary who＊s seeking armed confrontation everywhere? \nKjell Hasthi MMChomek ? 14 hours ago Trump presents the Globalists as an existential threat, and this election as the most important in human history. It is about saving humanity. \nMMChomek Kjell Hasthi ? 14 hours ago I understand and agree, now please try to fit what you＊ve just said into your previous post about Trump being the more attractive choice for the Pentagon, because I＊m lost here. \nKjell Hasthi MMChomek ? 14 hours ago That is new. Some group of (4 stars?) general approached Trump and asked him to be candidate. Their arguments were about stopping madman Hillary. Trump said yes to them \nMMChomek Kjell Hasthi ? 14 hours ago So there is an actual anti-war faction inside the Pentagon? That sounds too good to be true. Most of those guys lobby war like madmen, because they get lucrative advisor contracts with defense industries after they retire. Isn＊t it just some hearsay? \n??? \ndan kopfz MMChomek ? 11 hours ago Unlike the psychopaths in the white house, the vast majority of the military leadership are not completely insane, and would not meekly follow orders when those orders would mean the lives of millions of Americans. \nShould Hillary push for a no-fly zone, it＊s not the Russians she＊d need to worry about每it＊s a military coup. As everyone knows, in a military coup, you eliminate the current leadership. \ndan kopfz dan kopfz ? 11 hours ago There＊s another reality that the military would be taking into account, that mad Hillary probably wouldn＊t. \nChina is not stupid. \nAn empire doesn＊t get to be 8000+ years old by making miscalculations. China knows that if the US is willing to commit to a hot war with Russia, than they＊d be next if the US won. That means the Chinese would be looking to make sure that the US doesn＊t win, and given the current tensions in the South China, might join the war on Russia＊s side as a full ally, openly declaring war against the US. \nWithout going nuclear, in an open hot war against China and Russia (and Syria, and Iran, and others), NATO can＊t win. The Pentagon won＊t make that miscalculation either. \nPeter Jennings ? 14 hours ago The US have been fighting lame armies filled with soldiers who would rather be somewhere else. Tending to their crops or animals for example. \nAfghanistan isn＊t going as expected. Libya isn＊t going as expected. Iraq isn＊t going as expected. In Syria they have got bogged down, exposing their proxy war to all, when it was initially advertising as ＆humanitarian intervention＊. \nWhen it comes to Russia, a determined, battle hardened, well trained army with highly advanced weapons, the US will resemble europe during the last world war. Vote in a warmonger, you will get war, that＊s where they get their kicks. \nStevenStarr ? 14 hours ago Wishful thinking. \nrichardstevenhack ? 4 hours ago Apparently both Alexander Mercouris and Pepe Escobar have succumbed to what is known as ※cognitive dissonance§每 the attitude that because something would be impossible to accept, it therefore is impossible to happen. \nWhile I would expect some members of the Pentagon to school Clinton on the problems of establishing a no-fly-zone in Syria once she is elected, the fact remains that there is no reason to believe she will accept that position. \nAs I＊ve said before, the goal of the Syria crisis is to set the preconditions for a long war with IRAN. First Syria＊s military has to be degraded, then Israel (and possibly NATO) will attack Hizballah in Lebanon into the Bekaa Valley via Syrian territory. Then and only then can Israel initiate a war with Iran, having more or less ※disarmed§ Iran＊s allies right next to Israel. \nIf Israel wants to achieve its goal of taking Iran out of the Middle East picture, and the US military-industrial complex wants to achieve its goal of an expensive, profitable, decades long war with Iran, then Syria has to go. Which means that there will be no let-up in pushing for that result. \nAnd we all know Hillary Clinton is TOTALLY on board with both aims as a warmongering neocon. \nDid the Bush neocons fail to get the Iraq and Afghan wars started? \nWhy, then, should be assume, as Alexander and Pepe do, that Hillary Clinton cannot override any Pentagon reluctance and get a war with Syria started, regardless of the enhanced difficulties presented by the presence of Russia? \nObama was prepared to go to war with Syria in August, 2013. While Russia was not present at the time to make that a more difficult proposition, it proves that the US IS spoiling for war with Syria. The three UNSC Resolutions submitted by the US early on with Chapter 7 language in them to justify such a war were only vetoed by Russia and China, burned on Libya. They prove the US goal is war with Syria. \nThe US is not going to back down just because Russia presents a greater difficulty. Many in the Beltway really believe that if the US attacks, Russia will back down. They are probably wrong, but it will be a little late to find out once the war starts. \nFor another thing, the notion that doubling down on supplying weapons such as MANPADs to the insurgents will change the situation is ridiculous 每 and the Pentagon will inform her of that, too. Which leaves her with only one option: a direct US/NATO attack on Syria. \nShort of a straight-up Pentagon revolt, Clinton can and probably will start a war with Syria and Russia.",

    "text": "By BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley T he resistance to a Hillary Clinton presidency has already begun. Activists gathered in Chicago ※to strategize the fight against police violence, neoliberalism and imperialism,§ all of which promise to be hallmarks of her administration. The Black Misleadership Class plays its usual, toadying role. ※The liars who said they would hold Obama＊s feet to the fire are repeating their empty words and hoping no one pays attention.§ ※All forms of mass action must be used to deprive Clinton of support or claim of a mandate.§ The Hillary Clinton administration, Slick Willie part II, will bring catastrophe unless there is constant agitation waged against it. The same woman who bragged that her party platform was progressive now brags that Republicans endorse her. The situation is urgent but there is no need to despair or to reinvent the wheel. There are groups across the country engaging in protest and they show a clear path for a liberation movement. This columnist joined with 200 activists in Chicago for the Right to Exist, Right to Resist [3] conference organized by the International League of Peoples＊ Struggles (ILPS USA). The Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Police Oppression, Michigan Emergency Committee Against War and Injustice, Peoples Organization for Progress, Bayan USA, Chicago Teachers Union, US Palestinian Community Network, Committee to Stop FBI Repression and others met to strategize the fight against police violence, neoliberalism and imperialism. If it is true that no person is an island then no struggle should be waged in isolation. The people of Ferguson, Missouri received support from Palestine during their rebellion against police occupation. The neoliberal onslaught that privatizes education and closes schools also deprives Flint, Michigan of clean water and its democratic rights. American imperialism threatens all life on this planet with its constant provocations against Russia and China which risk world war. ※The black ※misleaders§ are silenced yet again by a prospective Democratic presidency.§ Moore: A former Bernie Sanders supporter and recent 100% convert to Hillary〞in the name of what? Good proof that liberals are forever blind to much of the world＊s realities. This presidential election repeated the sleight of hand which presents the Democrats as the party which defends us from the barbarians. Donald Trump is the foil used to fool millions of people into believing that the errand boys and girls of neoliberalism can also be the guarantors of human rights. Hillary Clinton＊s administration will be disastrous for black Americans in particular. The black ※misleaders§ are silenced yet again by a prospective Democratic presidency. They will not speak up against Hillary Clinton any more than they did against her husband or Barack Obama. They said nothing when Bill Clinton ended the 60-year long entitlement to government benefits. They said nothing when he used the war on drugs as an excuse to lock up thousands of black people with draconian prison sentences. They said nothing when Obama wouldn＊t allow those people to request their freedom or when he declined to prosecute even one killer cop. They say nothing when American presidents wage wars of aggression all over the world. We can expect more going along to get along when ※two for the price of one§ becomes a reality. WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO THREAD FOOLS RUSH IN . This presidential election repeated the sleight of hand which presents the Democrats as the party which defends us from the barbarians. Donald Trump is the foil used to fool millions of people into believing that the errand boys and girls of neoliberalism can also be the guarantors of human rights . Not only must activists do their utmost to fight back against the real life Lady MacBeth but they must call out those who falsely claim to be in their camp. The liars who said they would hold Obama＊s feet to the fire are repeating their empty words and hoping no one pays attention. They must be exposed right now and again after election day because they will surely make good on their history of appeasement. The Right to Exist, Right to Resist conference took place on the second anniversary of Laquan McDonald＊s murder at the hands of Chicago police. McDonald was only 17 years of age, a child according to American law. His death, the existence of the Homan Square secret prison and other instances of torture and brutality resulted in demands for community control of the police. ※She may bring the mothers of police murder victims on to the stage but she has said nothing about ending the death toll.§ Chicagoans are struggling to establish an elected Civilian Police Accountability Council [4] (CPAC). Black community control of the police is a mobilizing issue all across the country. The demands began under Obama and must continue after Hillary Clinton takes office. She may bring the mothers of police murder victims on to the stage but she has said nothing about ending the death toll. That task is left for activists who know better than to expect any justice from her. Millions of Americans struggle financially and are displaced by gentrification or fear the police or want to keep their public schools open. But in 2016 they have been led astray by one of the most cynical presidential campaigns of all time. Hillary Clinton preferred Donald Trump as her rival because she was likely to lose to any other Republican. She then used the man she wanted to run against to rally otherwise skeptical voters to her side. The ego maniacal Trump performed as expected and is driving all but dead-ender right wingers to Hillary＊s side. There must be no celebrating when her victory is announced. That is the moment when the fights must begin in earnest. All forms of mass action must be used to deprive her of support or claim of a mandate. The champion of the ruling classes cannot be allowed to claim the progressive mantle. That title belongs to the people who met in Chicago and marched in memory of Laquan McDonald. Frederick Douglass＊ advice to ※Agitate, agitate, agitate,§ must still be followed. If not Hillary Clinton will privatize Social Security and find a rationale to start one last disastrous war. She will be stopped only if we assert our right to exist and right to resist. Source URL: http://blackagendareport.com/organizing_in_age_of_hillary",

    "title": "Malcolm X on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump",
    "text": "A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by Bruce A. Dixon W hen astute political commentary from a half century ago eloquently describes the current political conundrum it means we＊ve been stuck in a bad place for a long time. Do we really want Malcolm＊s observation to apply four or eight or twenty years further into the future? It＊s that time again, it＊s presidential election season, and as we hear every four years, THIS is the most important presidential election of our lives. The fact that you＊ve heard that before should tell us something. It should us that in presidential years, many old things becomes new again, often because so much of what we＊re told IS new is really pretty old. Malcolm X has been dead now a half century, dead for more years than he was ever alive. But since at least one of the tricks and traps deployed to fool, frustrate and neutralize our grandparents＊ right to vote hasn＊t changed much we might want to listen carefully to what Malcolm＊s words in the aftermath of the 1964 presidential election. ※ If Johnson had been running all by himself, he would not have been acceptable to anyone. The only thing that made him acceptable to the world was that the shrewd capitalists, the shrewd imperialists, knew that the only way people would run toward the fox would be if you showed them a wolf. So they created a ghastly alternative. And it had the whole world 〞 including people who call themselves Marxists 〞 hoping that Johnson would beat Goldwater.§ Like today＊s Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was a truly reprehensible and frightening figure, who had opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination in public accommodations, and who favored the use of nuclear weapons to defoliate the Vietnamese countryside. Also like Donald Trump, Goldwater never really stood a chance of winning the election. Goldwater the wolf was buried beneath a Johnson landslide, carrying only 6 out of the 50 states. Republican officeholders are running away from Donald Trump not because he＊s a racist bufoon but because he＊s expected to lose states Republicans are accustomed to winning. The fox, Lyndon Baines Johnson went on to start a war in Indochina that killed three million Vietnamese alone. LBJ defoliated the Vietnamese countryside with millions of tons of Agent Orange instead of nukes, causing hundreds of thousands of hideous and gruesome birth defects that continue to this day. The wolf and the fox this year are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Trump is a real estate con man, a racist and a hyper-entitled sexual predator who talks about building walls and banning Muslims. Fortunately for us all, Trump has never been in government. Hillary has scarcely ever been out of government. She＊s fronted for Wal-Mart, executed bloody regime change in Libya, brought US troops to Ukraine on the Russian border, and publicly itches for a showdown in Syria. Thanks to Wikileaks there is copious evidence that Hillary＊s public stands on a wide range of issues from charter schools to so-called trade agreements, to fracking and social security stand in stark contrast to the promises she makes to the powerful. Just as it worked 52 years ago, the overwhelming defeat of her wolvish opponent will give Hillary the appearance of a mandate. But the margin of Hillary＊s victory provides those of us on the left an unprecedented opportunity. It means there is no need for those who imagine themselves on the of jobs, justice, peace and the planet to ride to Hilllary＊s rescue and ensure the defeat of Donald Trump. Trump has already beaten himself. This election is our best chance to break out of the decades-old two party trap and build a new political force, a new political party. The Green Party is the only peace party, the only party that stands for people and planet over profit, and our only opportunity to vote our hopes, not our fears. It＊s time to choose. We vote Green and build Green, we can consign the political conundrum Malcolm X eloquently described a half century ago to the garbage can of history. Or we can vote for Hillary, and Malcolm＊s words will be as applicable four or eight years or twenty years from now as they have been for the last fifty. For Black Agenda Radio I＊m Bruce Dixon.

    "title": "Hillary＊s ※Big Tent§ is Obama＊s ※Grand Bargain§ on Steroids",
    "text": "B y BAR executive editor Glen Ford B arack Obama tried to woo Republicans into a ※Grand Bargain§ that would have gutted Social Security. Bill Clinton let loose the banks. But Donald Trump＊s destruction of the Republican Party will allow Hillary Clinton to ※gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle.§ The rich are about to get their best deal yet. ※The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class.§ When Donald Trump took a wrecking ball to the Republican Party he provided the unexpected catalyst for completion of the corporate project begun by Bill Clinton, Al Gore and other white Democrats in the 1980s, with the founding of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). To counter relentless attrition of whites to the GOP in their home states, these beleaguered, mostly southern Democrats sought national corporate funding to turn their party decisively to the right. They reckoned, correctly, that a steady stream of corporate capital would allow them to control the new wave of Black voters and politicians that had been mobilized by Rev. Jesse Jackson＊s two presidential campaigns, while strengthening the hand of the South in national Democratic Party calculations. Bill Clinton became the first DLC president in 1992, and moved swiftly and methodically to narrow the ideological differences between the duopoly parties. He completed much of Ronald Reagan＊s agenda, claiming it as his own; destroyed welfare ※as we knew it§; vastly expanded the mass Black Incarceration regime; pushed NAFTA through Congress over the objections of majorities in his own party; engineered the corporate monopolization of broadcast media; and removed the last safety straps from Wall Street banks. ※Clinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo.§ In foreign affairs, Clinton initiated what was to become the doctrine of ※humanitarian§ military intervention, dismantling and partially occupying the socialist nation of Yugoslavia. In the process, Clinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo, thus keeping operational the network created by the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Pakistan during the previous decade in Afghanistan. In Africa, Clinton conspired with Uganda and exiled Tutsi rebels to overthrow the Hutu majority government in Rwanda, setting off a bloodbath in 1994, followed two years later by an invasion of Congo that has killed more than six million people 〞 and still counting. Barack Obama was the second DLC president (although he lies [3] about his membership). He, too, moved with unseemly haste to reach a ※Grand Bargain§ with the GOP 〞 not of necessity, since he had won a huge electoral mandate with the overwhelming financial backing of Wall Street, but as a matter of ideological principle. In January of 2009, before even taking the oath of office, Obama told the editorial boards of the New York Times and the Washington Post that all ※entitlements,§ including Medicare and Social Security, would be ※ on the table [4] § for cutting in his administration. Obama＊s first project, now considered the centerpiece of his legacy, was to resurrect the rightwing Heritage Foundation＊s corporate health insurance scheme, adopted by Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole in 1996, and made into state law by Republican Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, in 2006. Obama＊s Affordable Care Act was, literally, written by lobbyists for the insurance and drug industries, and is now collapsing like a poorly constructed house at the end of its mortgage. ※For the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his ＆Grand Bargain.＊§ With the Democratic majority in Congress in no mood to tamper with Social Security and Medicare, Obama tried to maneuver the targeted entitlements into a financial crisis trap. He named two dependable reactionaries, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, as co-chairmen of his National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility, also called the Commission on Deficit Reduction. They dutifully recommended $4 trillion in budget cuts, mostly to social programs, including cuts to Social Security. Although the full commission did not endorse the chairs＊ recommendations, and the Congress failed to pass bills modeled on the document, Obama used the Simpson-Bowles formula as a basis for negotiating what he hoped would be a ※bipartisan§ (GOP plus Obama and a minority of Democrats) massacre of entitlements. For the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his ※Grand Bargain.§ Congressional Black Caucus chairman Emanuel Cleaver, of Kansas City, called the deal a ※ Satan＊s Sandwich [5] ,§ but Obama continued to pursue a political marriage made in hell until the 2012 reelection campaign clock called a halt to the spectacle. ※A de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie.§ The quest for a Grand Bargain was Barack Obama＊s failed attempt to best Bill Clinton in erasing the distinctions between the two major parties 每 to create a de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie. It was the Republicans who ran away from the altar. And the Democrats did eat much of the Satan＊s Sandwich, through sequestration and austerity that ravaged social programs by other means. Why did the Republicans reject the deal? Although both halves of the duopoly ultimately answer to Wall Street, the Republicans, like any other party, have an institutional interest in winning office. It is true that Obama had crafted a deal that any Republican would love, but it was still his deal, and he planned to run for reelection as an historical dealmaker. Probably just as importantly, the Republican Party is the White Man＊s party, meaning, white supremacy is its organizing principle, central to its identity among much of the masses. To embrace Obama, no matter how advantageous to their big business patrons, was a hug too far for the GOP. Racism doomed the Grand Bargain 每 Hallelujah! A New, Bigger Bargain Recently released Wikileaks emails reveal Hillary Clinton speaking to bankers at Morgan Stanley in 2013, a year after the debacle. ※The Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right,§ she said. Thanks to Donald Trump＊s demolition of the Republican Party, the conditions have been created for Hillary Clinton, as DLC President #3, to achieve what #1 and #2 could not: gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle. With most of the ruling class and its attendants having vacated the building, the Republican Party has been reduced to Donald Trump and his ※deplorables,§ as Hillary calls them. Trump＊s opposition to corporate trade deals violated the Holy Grail against prohibiting capitalists from moving money and jobs around the world as they see fit, and his reluctance to support regime change as an inherent right of American exceptionalism has frightened and outraged the military industrial complex, the national security establishment, and all sectors dependent on the maintenance of empire. ※An inherently unstable arrangement.§ Clinton＊s Big Tent is not a temporary, election season dwelling. It is how she plans to govern. The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class, while at the same time the party nominally represents most of the folks who are abused and misused by that ruling class. It is an inherently unstable arrangement, and will soon be wracked by splits, as a post-Trump GOP attempts to lure its fat cats back and the darker and poorer constituencies consigned to the latrine area of Hillary＊s high class tent break to the Left for air. But in the interim, Clinton will have a unique opportunity to cut grand austerity deals with all the ※big elements§ of Simpson-Bowles, to renege on her corporate trade promises, and to wage war with great gusto in the name of a ※united§ country. Ever since the Democratic National Convention it has been clear that the Clintonites are encouraged to consider everyone outside of their grand circle to be suspect, subversive, or depraved. Their inclusive rhetoric is really an invocation of a ruling class consensus, now that Trump has supposedly brought the ruling class together under one banner. In Hillary＊s tent, the boardrooms are always in session. Source URL: http://blackagendareport.com/hillary_big_tent_grand_bargain",

    "text": "Share This: PATRICE GREANVILLE T he problem is that, while helpful to have the empire＊s managers show their true sociopathic face, her narrative is a distorted simplification bearing all the vices of her political prejudices and ignorance, the script favored by the US ruling class. \nConsider just one of her major lies, tossed about casually and sure to be swallowed whole by the perennially clueless audience: That The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan＃ The USSR did not invade Afghanistan . The besieged, progressive and modernising Kabul government〞a leftwing government that promptly moved to advance literacy, gave women full and unrestricted civil rights, and in general was trying to bring the nation out of the middle ages (program which Washington could care less), invited the Soviets to come in, as it was meeting stiff resistance to its reforms by the entrenched landlords and reactionary clerics in the countryside. Moscow accepted the invitation because it also suited its valid objective of not allowing the Americans to plant another huge military base on the Central Asia underbelly, part of the encirclement of Russia the US has been carrying out for many decades. The invitation is similar and as genuine as the invitation by the Government of Syria, today, to come in and fight against the Western-sponsored terrorists, an authority to set foot on Syrian soil which the Americans and their multiple sordid accomplices in mayhem in the Middle East, totally lack. Contrast this with Washington＊s actions in Vietnam, where it first refused to recognize the right of the newly independent Vietnamese to a free election (since they knew the communists led by Ho Chi Minh would win by a huge margin), and then simply invaded that nation under trumped up pretexts (Gulf of Tonkin, etc.).The closer you inspect the US government narrative, the clearer it becomes it is a tissue of cynical big lies, word-twistings, professional pr.r. spin, and self-serving myths and simplifications〞all in the service of sordid and criminal goals the elites can never admit to the American public.\nPHOTOS: Above〞Afghan women college students, a total novelty in Kabul, sporting Western dress, etc. (1978). Afghan women studying, as equals, in Kabul, 1979. The communist government in power then (PDPA, the People＊s Democratic party of Afghanistan) actually liberated Afghan women from centuries old customs that effectively enslaved them to husband and society. As usual, Western bourgeois feminists have said virtually nothing about the tremendous losses suffered by women and children as a result of Washington＊s intervention in Afghanistan on the side of the most reactionary sectors of society.

    "title": "The FBI Can＊t Actually Investigate a Candidate Such as Hillary Clinton.",
    "text": "Dispatches from Eric Zuesse This piece is crossposted at strategic-culture.org The power above the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the U.S. Attorney General, and, above that person, the U.S. President. That＊s whom the FBI actually serves 〞 not the U.S. public. This is the reason why the FBI is having such internal tensions and dissensions over the investigation of Hillary Clinton: Not only is she the current President＊s ardently preferred and designated successor 〞 and overwhelmingly supported also by America＊s artistocracy and endorsed by the aristocracy＊s press 〞 but the top leadership of the FBI have terms-in-office that (unlike, for example, the term of the U.S. Attorney General) do not end with the installation of the next President; and these people will therefore be serving, quite possibly, the very same person whom they are now ＆investigating＊. This is the reason why James Comey, the FBI＊s Director, let Clinton totally off the hook on July 5th, when he declined to present the case to a grand jury: he and the rest of the FBI＊s top management violated three basic principles of trying white-collar-crime cases when a prosecutor is serious about wanting to prosecute and obtain a conviction against a person 〞 he (and they) wanted to keep their jobs, not be fighting their boss and their likely future boss. Hillary: For all intents and purposes, above the law. If America were an authentic democracy, there would be a way for the FBI to serve the public even when the U.S. President doesn＊t want it to. According to the only scientific study that has ever been done of the matter, the U.S. federal government is a dictatorship not a democracy. This was reluctantly reported by the researchers, whose own careers are dependent upon the aristocracy which they were finding actually controls that government. They found that the U.S., at the federal level, is not a democracy but an ※oligarchy,§ by which the researchers were referring to an ※economic elite,§ America＊s billionaires and centi-millionaires who control America＊s international corporations and the ＆charities＊ (such as think tanks) that are dependent upon them 〞 including many that directly affect U.S. politics, such as the think tanks or other way-stations for former U.S. government employees to become hired by private firms. The authors of the only empirical scientific research-study that has been done of whether the United States is a democracy , or instead a dictatorship, excluded the very term ※aristocracy§ (or ※collective dictatorship§ such as an ※economic elite§ is if that ※elite§ actually is in control of the given nation＊s government) from their article. They did this so as for the meaning not to be clear to the U.S. public. In any country in the modern world where an aristocracy exists, aristocrats nowadays try to hide their power, not (like in former eras) display their power by crowns and other public symbols of ＆the nobility＊. The closest the study＊s authors came to using that term, ※aristocracy,§ was their only sentence that employed the pejoritave term for an aristocracy, ※oligarchy.§ That obscure lone sentence was: ※Jeffrey Winters has posited a comparative theory of ＆Oligarchy,＊ in which the wealthiest citizens 〞 even in a ＆civil oligarchy＊ like the United States 〞 dominate policy concerning crucial issues of wealth and income protection.11∪ .. Their 11th footnote made clear that they were referring here to the book Oligarchy , by Jeffrey A. Winters, which stated the ＆theory＊ that this article had actually just confirmed in the American case. Their article mentioned the book 〞 and the ※oligarchy§ 〞 only in this one footnote, so that the authors of the article (whose own careers are dependent upon America＊s ＆oligarchs＊) won＊t be able to be accused by oligarchs (or in any way thought by their own financial benefactors 〞 America＊s aristocrats) to have called the U.S. an ※oligarchy§ (a collective dictatorship by the few super-rich and their agents). To apply either term 〞 ※aristocracy§ or ※oligarchy§ 〞 to one＊s own country, is now viewed as negative, an insult to the country＊s controlling elite. Neither scholars nor scholarly publishers wish to insult the people who ultimately are their top funders. .. This article was written in the standard unnecessarily obscurantist style of social ＆scientists＊ who want to be comprehensible only to their peers and not to the general public. Doing it this way is safer for them, because it makes extremely unlikely that their own benefactors would retaliate, against them or else against the institutions that hire them, by withdrawing their continued financial and promotional support (such as by no longer having them invited onto CNN as an ※expert§). (This type of fear prevents theory in the social ＆sciences＊ from being strictly based upon the given field＊s empirical findings: it＊s not authentically scientific. The physical sciences are far less corrupt, far more scientific. The biological sciences are in-between.) .. One particular reason why the authors never called the people who control the U.S. government an ※aristocracy,§ is that everyone knows that the Founders of the U.S. were opposed to , and were engaged in overthrowing, the existing aristocracy, which happened to be British, and that they even banned forever in the U.S. the use of aristocratic titles, such as ※Lord§ or ※Sir.§ Consequently, within the U.S., the only term that the aristocrats consider acceptable to refer to aristocrats, is ※oligarchs,§ which always refers only to aristocrats in foreign countries , and so is considered safe by the aristocrats＊ writers (including scholars and political pundits) to use. .. Everyone knows: in accord with the clear intention of America＊s Founders , the U.S. should eliminate from its citizenry any aristocrat (any self-enclosed and legally immune group that holds power over the government), but Americans naturally accept the existence of ※oligarchs§ in other countries (and ※good-riddance to them there§), typically the ones in countries U.S. foreign policy opposes and often overthrows by means of coup or outright military invasion (any form of conquest, such as in 2003 Iraq, or 2011 Libya). It＊s fine to refer to other countries＊ aristocracies as ＆oligarchies＊, because any such foreign aristocracy can therefore be declared to be bad and ＆deserving＊ of overthrow. Thus, any aristocracy that is opposed to America＊s aristocracy (especially one that＊s opposed to being controlled by the U.S. aristocracy), and which wants to be controlling instead their own independent nation, can acceptably be overthrown by coup (such as Ukraine 2014 was) or invasion (such as Libya 2011 was). Thus, calling a foreign aristocracy an ※oligarchy§ is supportive of, not oppposed to, the U.S. aristocracy 〞 and, so, ※oligarchy§ is the term the authors used (on that one occasion, and they never used the prohibited term ※aristocracy§). .. Nonetheless, despite the cultural ban on describing the U.S. as an ※aristocracy,§ the authors were 〞 as obscurely as they were able 〞 proving that the U.S. is an aristocracy, no authentic democracy at all. Or, again, as they said it in their least-obscurantist phrasing of it: .. ※Economic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis, even though our findings probably understate the political influence of elites. Our measure of the preferences of wealthy or elite Americans 〞 though useful, and the best we could generate for a large set of policy cases 〞 is probably less consistent with the relevant preferences than are our measures of the views of ordinary citizens or the alignments of engaged interest groups. Yet we found substantial estimated effects even when using this imperfect measure. The real-world impact of elites upon public policy may be still greater.§ .. ＆Greater＊ than what? They didn＊t say. That＊s because what they were saying (as obscurely as possible) is that it＊s probably ＆greater＊ than is shown in the data that was publicly available to them, and upon which data their clear finding is that the U.S. is an aristocracy, no democracy at all. Or, as they also put it: ※Economic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis.§ But, actually, ※Economic Elite Domination theories§ (virtually all of which come down to positing an aristocracy that consists of the billionaires 〞 and centi-millionaires 〞 and their corporations, and their think tanks, and their lobbyists, etc.) did phenomenally well, in their findings, not just ＆rather well＊ 〞 they simply can＊t safely say this. Saying it is samizdat, in the U.S. dictatorship. .. They were allowed to prove it, but not to say it. So, that＊s what they did. They didn＊t want to ※upset the applecart§ from which they themselves are feeding. .. The simplest (but no less accurate) way of stating their finding is: the U.S., at least during the period the researchers probed, which was 1981-2002, was an aristocracy, no democracy at all. The U.S., in other words, was (even prior to the infamous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, which is making the aristocracy even more concentrated among even fewer people) a country of men (and women 〞 that＊s to say, of individuals ) not of laws; it＊s a dictatorship, in short; it is not a country ※of laws, not of men§ . America＊s Founders have finally lost. The country has been taken over by an aristocracy. .. And one of those ※men§ now, is actually Hillary Clinton, even though she is no longer officially holding governmental power. They know she soon might be. That＊s why, the FBI cannot really, and seriously , investigate her. .. It＊s not for legal reasons at all. It＊s because of whom she is. In fact, purely on the basis of U.S. laws, she clearly ought to be in prison . Any honest lawyer, inside or outside the FBI, has long known this, because the actual case against her is ＆slam-dunk＊ , even though the FBI has refused to investigate it and has limited its ＆investigation＊ only to peripheral ＆national security＊ issues. (The #2 person at FBI, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, right below Director James Comey, specified this limitation to his ＆investigators＊. They simply weren＊t allowed to investigate her, except on the hardest-to-prove crimes that she probably but not definitely did also do. The slam-dunks were just off-limits to them. McCabe＊s wife＊s political campaign had received $675,000 from the PAC of Terry McAuliffe , a close friend of the Clintons, who chaired Hillary＊s 2008 Presidential campaign. And, even on the harder-to-prove matters, which FBI Director Comey declined on July 5th to pursue, they stood a strong chance of winning, if only Comey hadn＊t prevented their moving forward to try 〞 but those issues are tangential to the basic case against her, anyway.) .. There are at least six federal criminal laws which accurately and unquestionably describe even what Ms. Clinton has now publicly admitted having done by her privatized email system, and intent isn＊t even mentioned in most of them nor necessary in order for her to be convicted 〞 the actions themselves convict her, and the only relevance that intent might have, regarding any of these laws, would be in determining how long her prison sentence would be. .. I have already presented the texts of these six laws (and you can see the sentences for each one, right there), and any reader can easily recognize that each one of them describes, unambiguously without any doubt, what she now admits having done. Most of these crimes don＊t require any intent in order to convict (and the ones that do require intent are only ※knowingly ＃ conceals,§ or else ※with the intent to impair the object＊s ＃ use in an official proceeding,§ both of which ※intents§ would be easy to prove on the basis of what has already been made public 〞 but others of these laws don＊t require even that); and none of them requires any classified information to have been involved, at all . It＊s just not an issue in these laws. Thus, conviction under them is far easier. If a prosecutor is really seeking to convict someone, he＊ll be aiming to get indictments on the easiest-to-prove charges, first. That also presents for the prosecutor the strongest position in the event of an eventual plea-bargain. As Alan Dershowitz said , commenting on one famous prosecution: ※They also wanted a slam-dunk case. They wanted the strongest possible case.§ Comey simply didn＊t; he wanted the hardest -to-convict case. His presentation was a brazen hoax. That＊s all. .. That＊s the real scandal, and nobody (other than I) has been writing about it as what it is 〞 a hoax. But what it shows is that maybe the only way that Clinton will be able to avoid going to prison is by her going to the White House. Either she gets a term in the White House, or else she gets a (much longer) term in prison 〞 or else our government is so thoroughly corrupt that she remains free as a private citizen and still above the law, even though not serving as a federal official. .. Even if she is convicted only on these six slam-dunk statutes (and on none other, including not on the ones that Comey was referring to when he said on July 5th that, ※Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case§), she could be sentenced to a maximum of 73 years in prison (73 = 5 + 5 + 20 + 20 + 3 + 10 + 10). Adding on others she might also have committed (such as the ones that Comey was referring to, all of which pertain only to the handling of classified information), would mean that her term in prison might be lengthier still, but what＊s important in the email case isn＊t that; it＊s to convict her on, essentially, theft and/or destruction of U.S. government documents by means of transferring them into her private email and/or smashing hard drives. No one, not even a U.S. federal official, can legally do that, and those six laws are specifically against it. .. Motive is important in Ms. Clinton＊s email case, because motive tells us why she was trying to hide from historians and from the public her operations as the U.S. Secretary of State: was it because she didn＊t want them to know that she was selling to the Sauds and her other friends the U.S. State Department＊s policies in return for their million-dollar-plus donations to the Clinton Foundation , and maybe even selling to them (and/or their cronies) U.S. government contracts, or why? However, those are questions regarding other crimes that she might have been perpetrating while in public office, not the crimes of her privatized email operation itself; and those other crimes (whatever they might have been) would have been explored only after an indictment on the slam-dunks, and for further possible prosecutions, if President Obama＊s people were serious about investigating her. They weren＊t. Clearly, this is selective ＆justice＊. That＊s the type of ＆justice＊ an aristocracy imposes. .. Why, then, did Comey finally switch to re-open the Clinton case? It wasn＊t merely the discovery of some of her previously unknown emails on the computer of Anthony Wiener, husband to Hillary＊s closest aide Huma Abedin. As Politico on October 28th reported , ※Another former Justice official said Comey＊s letter [announcing the re-opening of Hillary＊s case] could be part of an effort on his part to quiet internal FBI critics who viewed him as burying the Clinton probe for political reasons. ＆He＊s come under a lot of criticism from his own people for how he＊s handled this. He＊s trying to gain back some of their respect,＊ former Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said. ＆His ability to do what he does largely depends on the respect within his own ranks.＊§ .. Joachim Hagopian at Global Research headlined on October 30th, ※The Real Reasons Why FBI Director James Comey Reopened the Hillary Email Investigation§ , and reported: .. ※Former federal attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova spelled it all out in a WMAL radio interview last Friday just hours after the news was released that Comey had sent a letter informing Congress that the case is being reopened. DiGenova said that with an open revolt brewing inside the FBI, Comey was forced to go public on Friday with reopening the investigation. ＃ Finally, diGenova dropped one more bombshell in Friday＊s interview. An inside source has revealed to him that the laptops belonging to key Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, both wrongly granted immunity , were not destroyed after all as previously reported, but have been secretly kept intact by investigating FBI agents refusing to destroy incriminating evidence as part of the in-house whitewash.§ In other words: Comey was between a rock (the resignation-letters piling up on his desk from subordinates who felt that no person should be above the law) and a hard place (his ability to stay on at the FBI and not have a scandal against himself bleed out to the public from down below). The U.S. wasn＊t yet that kind of dictatorship 〞 one which could withstand such a public disclosure. In order for it to become one, the aristocracy＊s control would have needed to be even stronger than it yet is. .. Also on the 30th, Ed Klein in Britain＊s Dail Mail bannered : .. EXCLUSIVE: Resignation letters piling up from disaffected FBI agents, his wife urging him to admit he was wrong: Why Director Comey jumped at the chance to reopen Hillary investigation. James Comey revived the investigation of Clinton＊s email server as he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents, sources say. The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim [Comey] announced last July that he wouldn＊t recommend an indictment against Hillary. He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents＃ .. So, does this now mean that, finally, the FBI will bring before a grand jury the evidence that Hillary Clinton blatantly violated those six federal criminal laws against stealing and/or trying to destroy federal documents? .. There has never 〞 at least since 1981 〞 been so severe a test of the extent to which this nation is (as those researchers found it to have unquestionably been between 1981 and 2002) an ※oligarchy.§ However, a serious criminal prosecution of Ms. Clinton would potentially start an unwinding of this dictatorship. .. The present writer will make no prediction. However, obviously, the results of the election on November 8th will certainly have an enormous impact upon the outcome. Since I think that anyone but a complete fool can recognize this much, I＊m confident enough to assert it 〞 a conditional about the future. About the author =SUBSCRIBE TODAY!

    "text": "7. Emigre Super Bloc Part VII: Why Hillary Clinton Will Appoint Old World Nationalists to Cabinet Positions . Editor's Note If you learn nothing else from reading Eliason＊s ※Emigre§ series, you should take away how interlinked world events truly are. When you add in the machinations of various intelligence agencies and national covert operations groups, tracing a thread through from point A to point B can become an epic journey. It is also a journey that leaves you wondering whose interests are being served? In answering that question, it becomes clear that the answer is much more likely a small, influential group than a nation state. Just look at the map of the countries involved in Syria＊s ※civil war,§ and it becomes exceedingly clear that what is happening in Syria is anything but a civil war. It also casts a totally different light on Europe＊s rejection of Syrian refugees. How cruel and mean spirited can you get than to be involved in the war that has displaced most of a nation＊s population, and then close your borders to those displaced? \nW hether you are for Hillary Clinton or against her, the problem with Hillary Clinton isn＊t her lack of experience. Almost the entire political establishment is behind her. Throughout all the bumps and scandal in this whole election cycle, Republicans and former presidents are coming out of the woodwork supporting her. According to the LA Times she may well be one of the most experienced candidates in US history, even accounting for severe conflicts of interest inside the Clinton Foundation. Neither friend or foe doubt Hillary Clinton＊s experience after 30 years in politics. \nThe problem is even Hillary Clinton＊s friends say she has, is a history of acting without thinking, of making bad decisions. According to Neera Tanden : ※Almost no one knows better than me that her instincts can be terrible.§ \nDoes Hillary Clinton show bad instincts and terrible decision-making skills, and if she does, how will this affect the USA? \nAccording to journalist Robert Parry ※the people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe ※This consensus is driven by a broad-based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East＃ Taken together, the studies and reports call for more aggressive American action to constrain Iran, rein in the chaos in the Middle East and check Russia in Europe.§One of the lead organizations revving up these military adventures and also counting on a big boost in military spending under President Clinton-45 is the Atlantic Council, a think tank associated with NATO that has been pushing for a major confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia.§ \nThe Atlantic Council is the think tank for the CEEC which is associated with NATO. The CEEC (Central and Eastern European Coalition) has only one goal. At the beginning of the presidential campaign they put out a small list of questions for the candidates to decide who they would support for the president. \nThe first question was essentially ※Are you willing to go to war with Russia?§ Hillary Clinton has answered that question and received their unqualified support throughout the campaign. Who is the CEEC? \nThe Central and Eastern European Coalition represent the various Central and Eastern European countries to the US government. What makes them special in an election is that they control a 20 million person strong bloc vote in key states across the country and sway elections by themselves. The price of a Clinton win is war with Russia. \nIf that seems a little too much to be believable, reconsider the Iraq war. All it took was for the Iraqi diaspora to develop strong ties with like-minded people f rom ※ The Project for the New American Century§ that wanted regime change in Iraq. Many of the people associated with the PNAC crossed over into the Bush administration . They pushed the invasion together. \nJosh DeWind＊s and Renata Segura＊s paper Diaspora-Government Relations in Forging US-Foreign Policies utilized the following source to discuss the diaspora link to US-Iraqi relations: \nWalt Vanderbush＊s essay, ※The Iraqi Diaspora and the US Invasion of Iraq§ (chapter 9), traces the collaboration between leaders of the Iraqi diaspora and neoconservative Americans, many of them linked to the Iraqi National Congress (INC) and the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), to convince the US government to wage war and bring about ※regime change§ in Iraq＃ The INC claimed credit for placing 108 articles in the news media, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Times (of London), during a nine-month period before the war.§ \nIt wasn＊t terror, Osama, or even oil that the Iraq war was fought for. It was a guy named Ahmed Chalabi who was the only victor of the Iraq war. \nAmerican-emigre groups use their strategically settled populations in key battleground states, deep pockets, and unbridled political ambition to gain control over their home ※old§ countries. Even more insidious is the influence they exert over the United States to destroy old enemies. \nDo we want senior cabinet and policy positions filled by people who think starting WWIII is a good goal? Let＊s take a look at the make-up and politics of some of these. \nStarting at the top let＊s look at the Ukrainian emigres who lead the CEEC and the Atlantic Council. One thing anyone represented by the UCCA (Ukrainian Congressional Committee of America) or the UWC (Ukrainian World Congress) has in common is Axis-political heritage and beliefs. The OUN is the political grouping of Ukrainian nationalists and it would vote for Adolf Hitler if he was running in a heartbeat. \nUnless real Nazi political views (not neo-nazi) found a way to survive all these years with this group of people, the statement is just insulting. Anyone reading should be insulted because that level of offensiveness in a politically charged environment is wrong. \nNazism or Axis-Nazism are political beliefs and principles that structure a government the same as Republican or Democratic control would. The only difference is the ※ism.§ The ※ism§ means everything you do in your life revolves around your politic so it＊s not just political or social guides or guidelines. It＊s your lifestyle and everything wraps around it. Anything or anyone that goes against it is an enemy of the state, and it is personal. \nFrom their own words in the Ukrainian Weekly, real, active political Nazi＊s are alive, kickin＊ and ready for a Clinton win! It is the sheer number of groups self-identifying as practicing real Nazi beliefs in the US gaining policy and cabinet positions under a Clinton win that is incredible. \nThe Ukrainian World Congress, with its affiliates in over 40 countries , and others work tirelessly in trying to keep Ukraine and the Ukrainian spirit front and center. ※We have had a minister of finance, Natalka Jaresko, in the Cabinet. We now have Ulana Suprun as acting minister of health. We have many from the diaspora assisting with strategizing, reforming and supporting the overall cause. We have a highly successful program in Patriot Defence. We are out to change the way business is done. Unity to act when required has been the diaspora＊s mantra 每 this cannot be disputed. As time moves on, we see that things take a natural course. We see that two wings of the OUN 每 (OUNb)Banderivtsi and (OUNm)Melnykivtsi 每 are working actively on the international level, working in partnership and currently are in strong negotiations about becoming a single entity again.§ \nWith all you＊ve heard about Stepan Bandera＊s OUN since the Maidan coup in Ukraine, I＊ll bet you didn＊t know they call New York, Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia home. \nThe UCCA and the UWC still celebrate their Nazi SS because they are still Axis-nazis. The OUN were the vile Holocaust murderers during and after WWII and their politics live on in their children today. This is no different from the children of other Waffen-SS leaders, or if Hitler had surviving children that stood up and ran other countries based in Hitler＊s policy. These American kids are sent to Ukraine to learn how to copy and act like Stepan Bandera before they come back to America and get involved in policy making. \n※ OUNb leader Ivan Kobasa also took responsibility of making sure the Ukrainian-Americans received the proper secondary education at Ukrainian nationalist schools (MAUP) in Ukraine. From the mid-2000＊s enrollment in this educational system has skyrocketed. Today almost all members of the current Ukrainian government are graduates of this ideological system that was taught to them by ※moderates§ like David Duke (former head of the Ku Klux Klan in the U.S.) who is also a graduate of the MAUP system.§ \nWhile American media criticizes David Duke＊s support for Donald Trump, they say nothing about Hillary＊s strongest supporters hiring David Duke as a professor to teach their children college level history. Is Hillary Clinton too far right for David Duke? After all, he has no plans to conquer Russia. \nWhen you look at her campaign coffers and the most active political activists supporting Hillary Clinton, many are groups whose politics are not republican or democrat, but old-world nationalist. They are spread across America and still idolize their Waffen SS heroes, literally. They have statues and holidays and children＊s groups across America in cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago celebrating some of the vilest mass murderers in history. And they teach their children to idolize them and grow up using them as role models. They also bring up their children in the same political mold of ultra-nationalism. \nNow they want an America that will do the same. Over the last 30 years, the old world nationalists have moved into media and policy positions to make this happen. If that wasn＊t enough they control a 20 million person bloc vote in key states and swing states in important cities across America. \nI am not using the word nazi as an insult, this isn＊t neo-nazi or even a nazi revival. These groups have been the most extreme political activists in the USA over the last 50 years and are a continuation of what their parents were in the 1930＊s. In their own words, they never assimilated into American culture. They assimilated the culture to them. In the words of the CIA, they are political animals. Today, their wagons are circled around a Hillary Clinton presidency. \nThe OUN were the guards at the Holocaust prison camps, Waffen SS, and volunteer brigades that were famous for torture and murder. In Ukraine, they killed over 3 million people and conducted the first act of Holocaust at Babi Yar. \nThe funny part, if there was one, is that with every fiber of your being, you want to argue against these facts. The OUN on the other hand featured at least one of my articles on their rise in American politics even though I called them devils. The fact they find me credible shouldn＊t get lost on you. \nWhen these good friends of Hillary Clinton from the CEEC start getting tapped for advisory posts, and cabinet positions through the Atlantic Council or Project for a New American Century, will they automatically become Democrats or Republicans? \nDoes America want a war with Russia so the losers of WWII can settle old scores? \nFor the first time, under a Clinton presidency, America will have unbridled Axis-nazis/old world nationalists/ nazis in most of the cabinet and policy positions. They are getting the positions because they are delivering donations, bloc votes, political propaganda, and hard activism in battleground states. \nThe results for the Clinton campaign in emigre dominated states is the same as it was when they first got together. Clinton is up by 11 points in important emigre bloc voting districts. ＃In last month＊s heavily publicized Pennsylvania Senate race. Ukrainian and Baltic groups, protesting the administration＊s attempts to prevent the break-up of the USSR, supported the Democratic candidate, Harris Wofford. This position contributed to the defeat of Dick Thornburgh, a former attorney general in the Bush administration＃.§The Ukrainian Weekly, December 8, 1991, No. 49, Vol. LIX \nIn a Ukraine Weekly interview with candidate Bill Clinton- ※ For the last 40 years, many Ukrainians have been supporters of the Republican Party . However, Mr. Bush severely damaged his relations with Ukrainians with his ※Chicken Kiev§ speech, and by his unwillingness to see Ukraine＊s point of view in disputes with Russia. How will your party seek to secure the goodwill of voters concerned by this issue?§ ＃ Clinton＊s answer＃※The Bush administration has had a spotty record abroad＃ including the president＊s insulting warning against ※suicidal nationalism§ made before proindependence forces in Kiev in the summer of 1991 〞 and a failed economic record at home. We hope Ukrainian Americans will join our effort to put people first.§ 每 Interview with Candidate Bill Clinton-Ukrainian Weekly Issue 43, 1992 \nIn what has become the ultimate pay to play scheme, the Clinton＊s gave over Ukraine to OUNb nationalists to run as they saw fit. This was payment for political support and bloc votes that won the 1992 elections for Bill Clinton. American citizens were given a country to run and represent in any manner they chose to do it. \nAccording to Ukrainian nationalist scholar Taras Kuzio , the Axis-nazi political beliefs started to be taught to children in Ukraine after the OUNb took the reins. This was the preparation for what would become a nationalist coup in 2014 Ukraine. \nThis pattern follows the Clinton-NATO expansion and every CEE (Central and Eastern European) country freed by the Clintons followed suit. In Croatia, Croatian-Americans have more parliamentary seats and representation than any group from Croatia. \nOther than American-emigre groups gaining rule and representing the ※home country§ in the US, there is only one other universal factor each of them revived. Axis- nazi politics and political views became normal in their home countries. In Croatia, they even revived the Waffen SS Battalions. \nThe people at the CEEC are behind the Atlantic Council and PNAC will be making the domestic and foreign policy decisions in a Clinton administration. While I would not call Hillary Clinton a Nazi, the people she surrounds herself with actively are. There is very little doubt that Victoria Nuland, a Ukrainian-American brought up in these beliefs will be Secretary of State under a Clinton Administration. \nTo get an understanding of what that means, the same people that are deciding Ukrainian domestic and foreign policy will be sending their people to those cabinet positions. \nThe one thing for sure is even publications that support her candidacy wonder about Hillary Clinton＊s lack of judgment and surrounding herself with nationalist war-hawks that want war with Russia. \nAccording to the WEEK : ※At first, Obama went over the top of public opinion to avenge American honor against ISIS. Slowly, America＊s mission has crept to include some form of regime change with the ouster of Assad. Now Clinton is selling the American people on greater military interventions so that the U.S. can challenge Putin. Clinton seems unable to distinguish between what is of vital interest to the Russians and peripheral interest to America. She combines this with her bias toward always taking action 〞 of any sort, for good or ill. The combination is dangerous.§ \nThe article ends in the hope that Clinton is once again lying. Both current president Obama and Hillary Clinton are trying to sell America on the idea that there are moderates fighting a civil war in Syria. We are arming and training them. Are there moderates in Syria worth supporting? Do we have any business there to begin with? The article goes as far as stating the US is determined to overthrow every country that is friendly to Russia. \nRight now Clinton wants to establish a no-fly-zone to protect her moderates. Who are they? US Special Forces on the ground are adamant that Clinton wants to give US military support to ISIS even if it means starting an open war with Russia. \n※ Nobody believes in it. You＊re like, ＆Fuck this,＊§ a former Green Beret says of America＊s covert and clandestine programs to train and arm Syrian militias. ※Everyone on the ground knows they are jihadis. No one on the ground believes in this mission or this effort, and they know they are just training the next generation of jihadis, so they are sabotaging it by saying, ＆Fuck it, who cares?＊§ ※I don＊t want to be responsible for Nusra guys saying they were trained by Americans,§ the Green Beret added. \nSince 2014, Ukraine has fully supported al Nusra and at the beginning of the civil war pulled 200 ISIS fighters to the Ukrainian front lines. These fighters are jihadis from Crimea. They have also set up an ISIS training camp near Mariupol. Like all other volunteers, they don＊t receive government support and rob to make a living. \nBefore this, the Kosovo example looms large. Does inviting indicted mass murderers and people preparing for illegal organ trade (crimes against humanity) trials to your national party convention as special guests qualify as good judgment? Does it showcase Hillary Clinton＊s good instincts to be president? \nWelcome to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Hillary Clinton＊s special guest from Kosovo took time-out from preparing for his crimes against humanity case to give support and wish her well. ※Invited as a guest to the 2016 Democratic National Convention is none other than Kadri Veseli, the Speaker of the Kosovo Assembly. Veseli is a former Kosovar Albanian leader of the KLA and its spy organization SHIK. He＊s being indicted along with the current president of Kosovo, Hashim Thaci for small things like organ trafficking and crimes against humanity .＊ The main witness against Clinton friends, Veseli and Thaci, is a man that was ordered to cut the heart out of another man that was begging for mercy. In a 1998 interview with the BBC , US special envoy to the Balkans, Robert Gelbard had this to say about Veseli and Thaci; ※I know a terrorist when I see one and these men are terrorists.§ \nClinton＊s relationship with the Albanian and Kosovo killers stretches back to the Bill Clinton＊s first election in 1992. During the campaign season the Clinton duo found out quickly how powerful the emigre national vote was in America. In one fell swoop, the Albanians and the KLA after them went from what the USA definitely recognized as Islamic terrorists to victims we were going to war for. \nThe Clinton humanitarian bombing in the Balkans drove victims into the waiting clutches of the KLA, and the spread of Islamic terrorism worldwide. \nIn what became her first executive decision, first lady, Hillary Clinton brow-beat the unwilling president Clinton into bombing the Balkans and creating a humanitarian catastrophe. Today, as a result of this, ISIS is setting up training camps in what is widely referred to as ※Clinton country. ※ \n※ On the territory of Kosovo and Metohija , the local police detained three militants of so-called ※Islamic State§ (a terrorist organization banned in Russia), is going to organize a series of terrorist attacks in Serbia.§ Terrorists LIH (IGIL/ISIS) break through the Balkans to Western Europe March 2016. \nClinton＊s jihadi bloc vote in America remains central to her winning this election along with the rest of the CEEC. Does America want people advising the president that openly support genocide like the Kosovars, Albanians, or Ukrainians? \nHillary Clinton is not an Islamist. Hillary Clinton is not a Nazi. But the question remains. Why is she surrounded by, and listening to, people that are? Is that her best judgment? GH Eliason Mr. Eliason l ives in Ukraine.

    "text": "8. Emigre Super Blocs Part VIII:The Quasi-Legal Coup-Hillary Clinton Information Operations In Election 2016 . ※The purpose of ※ Inform and Influence Operations § is not to provide a perspective, opinion, or lay out a policy. It is defined as the ability to make audiences ※think and act§ in a manner favorable to the mission objectives. This is done through applying perception management techniques which target the audiences emotions, motives, and reasoning.\nThese techniques are not geared for debate. It is to overwhelm and change the target psyche. \nUsing these techniques information sources can be manipulated and those that write, speak, or think counter to the objective are relegated as propaganda, ill-informed, or irrelevant. ~ Global Research, US Psychological Warfare in Ukraine .§ \nW hat if the strife, rumor, and clamor that the world has seen in the presidential campaign were part and parcel of an Inform and Influence Operation against Americans to determine the election outcome? Bear with me for a moment as I lay out the proofs. The quote above is from an early 2015 article with the author showing what it could look like in the civilian world. \n§ What would we do? Disrupt, deny, degrade, deceive, corrupt, usurp or destroy the information. The information, please don＊t forget, is the ultimate objective of cyber. That will directly impact the decision-making process of the adversary＊s leader who is the ultimate target.§ 每 Joel Harding \nIO or IIO (Inform and Influence Operations) as defined by the US Army includes the fields of psychological operations and military deception. All of this is used in the civilian world the same way by private contractors. \nIn this election, private contractors were hired to focus their capacity to influence the American population. This is proven and you deserve a step by step look at it if you are voting. \nWhat Project Veritas shows is damning evidence of what I have been documenting in the emigre series articles since spring 2016. \nBy using mainstream media, they started an integrated approach which includes influencing their political opponent＊s decision making. Media is given messages that follow the same themes and fill the entire information space by using an across the board effort. The effort drowns out any other message. \nAccording to the Observer, this has been happening throughout the election cycle to benefit Hillary Clinton. ※ Rather than informing voters to enrich democracy , the mainstream media has developed a feedback loop between support for particular candidates and the political agenda they intend to support. The freedom of the press is necessary for a democracy to function.§ The article further points out that it was the media that helped rig the primaries against Bernie Sanders. \nWikileaks has clearly shown the interplay between mainstream media and the Clinton campaign. And they have shown clearly that most of the mainstream media are working to influence the election . This goes beyond partisan electioneering. All of this follows the exact pattern, a well planned Information Operation against the American public . \nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was also the Ex-Officio Board Member of the BBG . The BBG (Broadcasting Board of Governors) run RFE/RL (Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty). Most of the 8-member board, appointed by the President of the United States, are the who＊s who of powerful media moguls in film, news, print, and radio. Appointment to the BBG is like being awarded an ambassador position for the media industry. It＊s also why big media carries the same line or themes. \nThe 7th member of the board of directors which runs RFE/RL is Mathew Armstrong . He is a longtime friend and mentor to retired Brigadier general Joel Harding. He provides Harding a lot of access and influence in media. Armstrong＊s background is public relations. He is an expert in IO and IIO operations. His bio: Author, lecturer, and strategist on public diplomacy and international media . He has worked on traditional and emerging security issues with both civilian and military government agencies, news organizations, think tanks, and academia across several continents. \nIn what appears to be a conflict of interest, at least two BBG board members are working actively for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. \nKaren Kornbluh is helping refine and to get Hillary Clinton＊s message out. § All of them are names to watch if Clinton wins 〞 and key jobs at the FCC and other federal agencies are up for grabs.§ \nAccording to her bio : Karen founded the New America Foundation＊s Work and Family Program and is a senior fellow for Digital Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. Karen has written extensively about technology policy, women, and family policy for The Atlantic , The New York Times and The Washington Post . New York Times columnist David Brooks cited her Democracy article ※Families Valued,§ focused on ※juggler families§ as one of the best magazine articles of 2006. Michael Kempner is the founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of MWW Group, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, and may get a greater role if she is elected . Kempner is a member of the Public Relations Hall of Fame. Michael Kempner hired Anthony Weiner after the sexting scandal broke in 2011. \nJeff Shell, chairman of the BBG and Universal Filmed Entertainment is supporting a secondary role by being an honor roll donor to the Atlantic Council . While the BBG is supposed to be neutral it has continuously helped increase tensions in Eastern Europe. While giving to the Atlantic Council may not be illegal while in his position, currently, the Atlantic Council＊s main effort is to ignite a war with Russia. This may set up a major conflict of interest. \nAccording to journalist Robert Parry ※The people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe ※This consensus is driven by a broad-based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East.§ \nParry goes on to say that at the forefront of this is the Atlantic Council, a think tank associated with NATO. Their main goal is a major confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. \nThe Atlantic Council is the think tank for the CEEC (Central and Eastern European Coalition) which is associated with NATO. The CEEC has only one goal. The question it poses to candidates that mattered is ※Are you willing to go to war with Russia?§ Hillary Clinton has received their unqualified support throughout the campaign. \nThe Central and Eastern European Coalition represent the various Central and Eastern European countries to the US government. What makes them special in an election is that they control a 20 million person strong bloc vote in key states across the country and sway elections by themselves. The price of a Clinton win is war with Russia. \nWhile the rest of the BBG board support Clinton＊s proposed policy of closing Syrian airspace, the CEEC wants it because it will mean direct conflict with Russia. Hillary Clinton＊s first foray into Islamic politics led to genocide and made the way for ISIS setting up training camps in Kosovo. Hillary Clinton has been friendly with jihadists for as long as she has had a national political career. According to US Special Forces on the ground in Syria training the moderates, there are NO moderates to train . \nGreen Berets are forced to train jihadis that they know will eventually attack us. Support our troops? Give them good, honorable missions. They deserve better, don＊t they? \nAs you go through the above links, the information is staggering. Shown are large groups of people strategically located in swing states that will do anything to get her elected. The question is why? \nPolitically, we have a two party system. If you say you are Republican, people have at least a general idea of what you mean. For Democrats, it＊s no different. There are different kinds of politics that fit easily under each umbrella. But the point is they are recognizable and we know where they stand on issues. \nTell me, what are OUNb beliefs? OUNb is a political party and set of beliefs just like Republican or Democrat. The reason I am asking is that you can＊t tell me. The odds are you haven＊t heard about it before. When the Atlantic Council or The Project for the New American Century takes all the senior positions in the Clinton White House, it will be filled with OUNb and similar political partisans for the first time without dissenting voices. \n※Unity to act when required has been the diaspora＊s mantra 每 this cannot be disputed . \nAs time moves on, we see that things take a natural course. We see that two wings of the OUN 每 (OUNb)Banderivtsi and (OUNm)Melnykivtsi 每 are working actively on the international level, working in partnership and currently are in strong negotiations about becoming a single entity again.§ \nThe OUNb political party started under Stepan Bandera and their political beliefs are quite literally Nazi. In the 1930＊s they swore undying loyalty to Adolf Hitler and the Diaspora was directing Waffen SS battalions from America secretly even as other Ukrainian emigres were fighting them. The UCCA is the head of OUNb thought in America and now they want America to celebrate their totalitarian beliefs with them. If you disagree with totalitarian politics, you are the enemy. After a brief description of what kind of beliefs the people have from the Atlantic Council that are taking up cabinet positions, the proof it is happening now follows. \nThe OUNb were the SS that manned the concentration camps during the Holocaust. They successfully murdered 3 million war prisoners by starving them to death. The OUNb killed over 250,000 Jews, 500,000 Ukrainians, and committed the first Holocaust at Babi Yar. Today the UCCA is funding and running the volunteer battalions raping and killing in Donbass the same way. \nThey and the other emigre group leaders are also behind buying the media headlines and reach, damage control, and the Information Operation against Americans today. If you want to know what American politics will look like within a few years, look at Ukraine. \nThere are people who live abroad, who do not feel fully accepted as a minority, and here there is a phenomenon which I call long-distance nationalism. . .The members of the diaspora create for themselves an image of the home land, which is a stronger emotional investment than the country in which they live＃One negative consequence of the diaspora experience is the emergence of what Ander-son calls non-responsible politics: diaspora participation in the politics in the country with which they identify can often be toxic, and their impact can be felt through the funding of particular political figures, nationalist propaganda, and even weapons＃- Multiculturalism, memory, and ritualization: Ukrainian nationalist monuments in Edmonton, Alberta 每 Pers Anders Rudling \nWith the field day the Emigres and paid media had with Donald Trump over David Duke, they forgot to tell you that Ukrainian emigres supporting Hillary Clinton hired Duke in Ukraine as a professor of history and sent their American kids to learn there. Almost all Ukrainian politicians have been through this fascist education system known as MAUP . The Ukrainian American and other likeminded ethnics are the people that will fill the senior foreign and domestic cabinet positions. \n※ OUNb leader Ivan Kobasa also took responsibility of making sure the Ukrainian-Americans received the proper secondary education at Ukrainian nationalist schools(MAUP) in Ukraine. From the mid-2000＊s enrollment in this educational system has skyrocketed into the hundreds of thousands. Today almost all members of the current Ukrainian government are graduates of this ideological system that was taught to them by moderates like David Duke who is also a graduate of the MAUP system.§ \n※I do care about social and economic issues affecting every American, but given the war in Ukraine, there is only one issue that we as Ukrainian Americans must focus on: Ukraine . \nThe Ukrainian issue ※trumps§ all other personal issues! \nA vote for Trump is a vote against Ukraine! \nWhen it comes to U.S. elections, Ukrainian Americans are a statistically minor, divided, unorganized voting group. The Central and East European Coalition is a coalition of U.S.-based organizations that represent their countries of heritage, a voting group of over 20 million people. The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America and the Ukrainian National Association are member organizations of the CEEC. Americans of East and Central European heritage can make a significant difference and influence the election result if their attention is focused.§ Ukraine Weekly The Presidential Election: Can We Make A Difference \nHillary Clinton＊s response is she will defend Ukraine＊s borders! Even though it has no eastern or northern border to defend. She has guaranteed to start a war with Russia if she is elected. \nNot only is Clinton buying the media through these second parties, but they are hiring professional, former military psyops professionals to deny pertinent information from voters and disrupt her political opponents message. At the same time, they are paying an across the board mainstream media to simultaneously publish articles and video that lift her campaign up, disrupt, destroy, and drown out alternate messages. \nWikileaks noted this when it exposed the Clinton campaign＊s program to incite violence and obfuscate the point. The Huffington Post example of this is§ Editor＊s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims 〞 1.6 billion members of an entire religion 〞 from entering the U.S§. \n※ We understand the Clinton camp has hired beaucoup and Zwanzig (a lot) of trolls, we also understand the Kremlin has done the same. We just do not know if Trump has followed suit. From a counterintelligence perspective, this is confusing as heck. \nOne of the really neat things about this election is seeing all my information operations and information warfare friends on social media, contributing and commenting, looking darned intelligent! Theirs is normally the voice of reason, maturity, and intelligence.§ Joel Harding \nBy systematically and continually attacking the voter＊s psyche, Americans are being treated in the same way our government treats countries they overthrow . The right to make an informed vote has been denied to support any particular candidate. \nWhat does an Inform and Influence Operation entail against the American public? Read the following carefully. The term ※anti-western§ refers to anyone that disagrees with whom he is working for. In this case, he works for the Ukrainian Emigres. This also covers Syria. Every media outlet or journalist writing about these subjects that aren＊t carrying the line he lays out is the enemy. These are the tactics being used today during the election. \n※I am building a database of planners , operators, logisticians, hackers, and anyone wanting to be involved with special activities I will call ＆inform and influence activities＊. I have received a few different suggestions to help organize operations 每 of all sorts 每 against anti-Western elements. No government approval, assistance or funding. This skirts legalities. This is not explicitly illegal and it may not even be legal, at this point. That grey area extends a long way. I am only trying to assess the availability of people willing to participate in such efforts. Technology, equipment and facility offers are also appreciated. If you would like to be included in my database, please send a tailored resume to joel_harding@§ \nIf you don＊t think this is possible , this has been going on around you for a long time. look at the credentials of retired Brigadier General Joel Harding and decide for yourself. But first look at what he promises he can do for you when you hire him. \n※ Information operations and warfare, also known as influence operations, includes the collection of tactical, operational and strategic information about a competitor as well as the dissemination of information and propaganda in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an competitor or adversary in the corporate, government or military realm. \nIt is our job to maximize your advantages over your competitor while minimizing your competitor. We work on the national level down to the individual level.

Before going further, ask yourself if this is what elections are supposed to be? \nAs a litmus test take Hillary＊s name out and put down what is known just through Wikileaks in a list. Put McCain＊s name, Kucinich, Paul, Bush, and ask yourself would this be an acceptable candidate? Add what＊s been shown here. Is there an acceptable candidate? \nIf any of them would be acceptable, sorry like many others you drank the kool-aid already. \n※ I＊ve seen how our heroes, activists , journalists, and celebrities have completely sold their souls to support something no person with an iota of morality would do. I＊ve seen them say and do things to derail candidates who would have been a million times better for those less fortunate around us. It＊s unfortunate most pretend to fight the establishment, to act like they love the people more than they love the struggle and the relevance that it brings them. I am not one of those and I won＊t continue to be until the good Lord takes me.§ Cesar Vargas \nHillary Clinton is not a Nazi. But every position of relevance will be filled with people that really are political Nazis. They are technically integral nationalists. They look down on democracy in any form. At least now you know what kind of government you are voting for. \nRegardless of who wins, there are 2000 tanks, artillery, and rockets pointed my way, waiting for this election to be over. I am an American that lives in Donbass, and wrote many of the early breaking stories and much of the background about the conflict in Ukraine. \nIf you cannot objectively look and see a more sophisticated version of what happened here through 2014 is going on, I can＊t help you. Soon the OUNb will order the volunteer battalions to start killing civilians on a large scale again. I will go back to reporting on the war. \nIf all these things weren＊t being done, I would keep it simply about policy. Russia is not an enemy of the United States. Instead, I believe I am witnessing a quiet coup that demands legality in America. \nIf this Information Operation is allowed to win the 2016 presidency, then elections are fruitless. Every other election will be based on the same strategy. They will have to be for any candidate to win. \nYour voice, your views, your informed choice will no longer matter.

    "text": "ABOVE: Image by DonkeyHotey | CC BY 2.0 ※We must develop a principled opposition to US imperialist policy [in Syria], without prevarications. The task falls on the left, but it cannot be a left divided by relativist consideration of ※evil§ on all sides＃§ W hy are they lying? Everything is being done to convince the public that Russia wants war; that it has annexed Ukraine; that it will attack Western Europe; that it will crush the Baltic states and Poland in its advance; that it＊s committing war crimes in Syria; that Assad is a dictator and a butcher; that he has met peaceful demands for reform with brutal repression; that those fighting Assad are moderate rebels; that he is dropping barrel bombs on civilians. Why are they lying? Because the people don＊t want war: they want jobs and bread. They will not agree to murder people who have done them no harm. They will consent to war if told they are under attack or that the war will save other people from genocide, rape, or other gross violations of human rights. The people are not interested in world domination, but the elite are. The people are, therefore, the enemy within. They must be persuaded to support the elite＊s plan by perverting their decency. They must be made to cringe in fear. They must be made to believe that war〞any war〞will be defensive. This is the tactic of terrorists: terrorizing the population to obtain political ends. Hillary Clinton is lying: a no-fly zone in Syria will not ※save lives.§ In her last presidential debate, Clinton said that she wants a no-fly zone in Syria because it will ※save lives§: ※I＊m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria, not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians.§ The ※leverage§ she is seeking is Russian roulette with the planet. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dunford, noted in response that a no-fly zone in Syria might trigger a war with Russia, a nuclear power. Neither does she believe that a no-fly zone will save lives. In a closed-door speech to Goldman Sachs in 2013, Clinton said: ※To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we＊re not putting our pilots at risk〞you＊re going to kill a lot of Syrians.§ She knows what is at stake with a no-fly zone in Syria, and yet she tells us the opposite of what she knows will happen. In other words, she＊s lying. What has changed Clinton＊s mind since 2013? In 2013, there was no need to risk nuclear war over Syria. The so-called Free Syrian Army and assorted rebel groups were doing just fine in their offensive. In 2013, Syria stood alone, apart from some Iranian assistance. Until 2015, the Assad government was on its last breath, in retreat from the provinces of Raqqa, Aleppo, Hama, Idlib, and Latakia. By September 2015, the generous financial, military, and operational support by the United States, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey to the ※anti-Syrian coalition§每 Islamic State, the Jabbat al-Nusra, the ※Free Syrian Army§每was paying great dividends in advancing the destabilization of the Assad government. Soon, it could be expected that the symbolic head of Assad would sit on a silver platter in the White House, along with other colonial trophies. In their obsession to vilify Trump, who certainly deserves a lot of manure for his innumerable character flaws and vile political ideas, the Democrats and other liberals massing under Hillary＊s ※Big Tent§, have totally forgotten Hillary＊s many crimes and also embraced the demonization of Putin and Russia, a different game altogether, and one with huge risks for humanity. The Orwellian assault on Russia is part of a filthy propaganda line floated by the warmongering Neocons Imperialists, of which Hillary is a card-carrying member. But self-righteous stupidity, and lopsided vision is the very trademark of Democratic party liberals and fellow water carriers. The saddest and most disturbing part of this abject campaign without precedent in its degree of filth even for American standards, is that even people who normally know better have embraced it, as this disgraceful cartoon by the normally lucid Dan Perkins (Tom Tomorrow comic strip) sadly proves. (Click image for best resolution). The humanitarian consequences for Syrians, however, were catastrophic. Fleeing the terror of a Syria in the clutches of cutthroat mercenary armies, refugees flooded Turkey, Jordan, Greece, and other countries, becoming human barter between Turkey and the European Union. The EU paid Turkey two billion euro to keep within its borders this human avalanche of ※collateral damage.§ That was the situation in September of 2015, when Russia, invited by the legitimate Syrian government, legitimately intervened in Syria with aircraft, support personnel, military advisors and equipment. In a year of Russian efforts to establish a premise for a peaceful solution in Syria by eliminating the militant rabble the Western chorus of ※Assad must go§ has mutated into a furious hiss of impotent rage. No one expects Assad to go now, unless the US comes up with a strategy to reverse the losses the Russian intervention has inflicted. In a year of Russian efforts to establish a premise for a peaceful solution in Syria by eliminating the militant rabble the Western chorus of ※Assad must go§ has mutated into a furious hiss of impotent rage. Enter Hillary＊s reversal on the no-fly zone, which now, contrary to her judgment in 2013, will ※save lives.§ What is a no-fly zone? A no-fly zone is a coercive appropriation of the partial airspace of a sovereign country. It is the arbitrary creation of a demilitarized zone in the sky to prevent belligerent powers from flying in that air space. In Syria, the ※belligerent power,§ ironically, would be the internationally recognized legitimate Syrian government and its legitimate ally, Russia. According to former UN Secretary Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in an interview with John Pilger, a no-fly zone is illegal under international law. No-fly zones are post-Soviet inventions. The measure was never proposed, used, or authorized to this day by the UN Security Council until the Soviet Union virtually dissolved. This restraint was exercised by the US for the excellent reason that no such aggression on a sovereign state would have been tolerated without massive fuss at the UN Security Council and a bad rap for the US. There have been only three instances of a no-fly zone so far, all in the wake of the disappearance of the USSR: Iraq (1991-2003), Bosnia (1993-95), and Libya (2011), all initiated on the hypocritical pretense of ※saving lives.§ What is Plan B? I n one word: escalation. Apart from partitioning the air space of Syria, Plan B would provide for supplying, through Qatar or Saudi Arabia, man-portable air defense systems to the ※moderate opposition,§ including if it is acknowledged that the ※moderate opposition§ has allied itself openly with the al-Nusra front. Plan B has not been approved, but the media has floated a series of reports throughout October as being under consideration. On October 28, the New York Times published an astonishing conclusion about an aspect of the Obama administration＊s strategy in Syria, though gently and benevolently worded. The Times indicated that it was being felt that Obama had insufficiently armed the ※moderate opposition,§ so that in Aleppo it had ※no choice§ but to partner with al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fatah al-Sham (formerly al-Nusra) to fight off Putin and Assad. At the same time, Reuters noted that the Obama administration had formerly considered arming the ※moderates§ with anti-air missiles but was constrained by the fear that such weapons would fall in the hands of §extremists.§ Such reports suggest, rather boldly, I think, that ※former restraint§ might have to give way to greater support for the ※moderate§ militants, including if they partner with ※extremists.§ Thus, we arrive at a point of utter bewilderment in which we verify the absurdity of launching a War on Terror to end up fighting a War with Terror. Oppose US imperialism I t is good and proper that we should denounce Hillary Clinton for her vile record of regime change (in Honduras), crime of aggression (Libya), threats to Russia and China, corruption, illegality, and abuse of power. She＊s clearly unfit to be president of any decent country that calls itself democratic. However, fixating on her individual agency lets the policy off the hook. The US is not yet a banana republic, in which the patriarch of some rich landowning family becomes the patriarch-autocrat of a country. An intricate network of powerful interests, which determine the policy, rules the US, frantic to maintain global economic and military dominance. This ruling class selects the candidate who will best carry out the policy. Hillary Clinton will be the servant of the interests of the ruling class of which she is a member. She will be their president. So it＊s the policy that must be opposed, and this policy is imperialist. We must develop a principled opposition to this policy, without prevarications. The task falls on the left, but it cannot be a left divided by relativist consideration of ※evil§ on all sides. However we may feel about the morality of governments in Russia, China, Syria, Iran, etc., one thing is clear: they did not launch a war on Iraq, opening the door to all the crimes that followed from that original crime. It is time to decide whether we want to live with things as they are or change them. And we must begin by changing them at home.

    "title": "A Hillary Win Will Be Google＊s Win of Everything",
    "text": "Share This: Dispatches from Eric Zuesse O n November 7th, a Morning Consult and Politico poll of early voters showed Donald Trump to be overwhelmingly viewed by early voters as being the more dangerous of the two major-Party candidates. The mega-corporation Alphabet, formerly known as Google, deserves a lot of the credit for that result, on candidate Hillary Clinton＊s behalf 〞 against, first, Bernie Sanders, and, now, Mr. Trump. Eric Schmidt, the billionaire Chairman and top executive of Alphabet Corporation, has been behind the scenes working for her campaign all along, and will be beyond being the most powerful person in the world (which he already was) if she wins. On 1 February 2016, FORTUNE bannered, ※Google＊s Parent Seizes Apple＊s Crown As Most Valuable U.S. Company§ , and that understated the reality: it＊s been actually the entire world＊s most valuable company ever since that time (and not merely the ※Most Valuable U.S. Company§). Eric Schmidt: One of the billionaires who control our destiny, for the worse. \nSchmidt detailed in the recently wikileaked 2014 email to Hillary＊s campaign, the means for winning both the nomination and the ultimate victory. It was an email to Hillary Clinton＊s aide Cheryl Mills, dated 15 April 2014 , and was promptly forwarded by her to John Podesta, Hillary＊s campaign manager. Here is just the opening of it, to indicate the types of matters it addressed: 1. Size, Structure and Timing Let＊s assume a total budget of about $1.5Billion, with more than 5000 paid employees and million(s) of volunteers. The entire startup ceases operation four days after November 8, 2016. The structure includes a Chairman or Chairwoman who is the external face of the campaign and a President who is the executive in charge of objectives, measurements, systems and building and managing the organization. Every day matters as our end date does not change. An official campaign right after midterm elections and a preparatory team assembled now is best. 2. Location The campaign headquarters will have about a thousand people, mostly young and hardworking and enthusiastic. Its important to have a very large hiring pool (such as Chicago or NYC) from which to choose enthusiastic, smart and low paid permanent employees. DC is a poor choice as its full of distractions and interruptions. Moving the location from DC elsewhere guarantees visitors have taken the time to travel and to help. The key is a large population of talented people who are dying to work for you. Any outer borough of NYC, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston are all good examples of a large, blue state city to base in. Employees will relocate to participate in the campaign, and will find low cost temporary housing or live with campaign supporters on a donated basis. This worked well in Chicago and can work elsewhere. The computers will be in the cloud and most likely on Amazon Web services (AWS). All the campaign needs are portable computers, tablets and smart phones along with credit card readers. 3. The pieces of a Campaign a) The Field Its important to have strong field leadership, with autonomy and empowerment. Operations talent needs to build the offices, set up the systems, hire the people, and administer what is about 5000 people. Initial modeling will show heavy hiring in the key battleground states. There is plenty of time to set these functions up and build the human systems. The field is about organizing people, voter contact, and get out the vote programs. .. Then, for example, there＊s this: .. Partners like Blue State Digital will do much of the fund raising. A key point is to convert BSD and other partners to pure cloud service offerings to handle the expected crush and load. d) Media (paid), (earned) and (social), and polling New tools should be developed to measure reach and impact of paid, earned and social media. The impact of press coverage should be measurable in reach and impact, and TV effectiveness measured by attention and other surveys. Build tools that measure the rate and spread of stories and rumors, and model how it works and who has the biggest impact. Tools can tell us about the origin of stories and the impact of any venue, person or theme. .. and this: .. In the case where we can＊t identify the specific human, we can still have a partial digital voter id, for a person or ※probable-person§ with attributes that we can identify and use to target. As they respond we can eventually match to a registered voter in the main file. This digital key is eventually matched to a real person. It＊s focused on controlling the outcome regardless of the actual merits of the competing candidates; and Schmidt was an ultimate insider in his knowledge of what companies Podesta should select to carry out the various parts of this operation. (Of course, those companies will then be in a privileged position, alongside Alphabet, serving a Clinton Administration.) S chmidt also was proving to Hillary that in his work for her he was entirely objective in her interests, such as by his recommending Amazon, his big cloud-computing competitor, instead of Alphabet＊s own cloud-computing service. This is a bipartisan operation, for her, against any and all other candidates. .. Schmidt also was crucially involved in helping in 2011 to plan the coup in Ukraine that Hillary＊s State Department was then working on, and which culminated successfully in February 2014 . ( Here＊s Hillary＊s prot谷g谷 Victoria Nuland overseeing the operation and selecting on 4 February 2014 who would be leading the country after the coup: ※Yats§ .) This ＆democratic revolution＊ ※featured civic self-organization aided by the use of Internet-based social media, neighborhood initiatives, and online news sites§ , and this online operation (directed mainly at rallying Ukraine＊s anti-Russians, called ＆pro-EU＊ people) fits precisely the ※tech camps§ that started inside the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine on 1 March 2013 , after Google＊s CEO Eric Schmidt and Google＊s and the U.S. State Department＊s Jared Cohen, had deceived wikileaks＊ founder Julian Assange into informing them, on 23 June 2011 , how to foment massive public demonstrations online. As planned (and, of course, Assange had no fore-knowledge of any of this), the coup ended in a very bloody ＆false-flag＊ operation on 20 February 2014, in which Right Sector paramilitaries who had been trained by the rabidly anti-Russian racist Dmitriy Yarosh , and who were dressed as state-security police, shot down upon the crowd and murdered both regular policemen and the protesters, so that the bloodshed would be blamed on the man Obama was trying to oust, the democratically elected President, Viktor Yanukovych (who was lots more popular among Ukrainians than any of the subsequent top leaders of Ukraine have been). .. Then these Right Sector mercenaries massacred an untold number of Crimeans who had been peacefully demonstrating there in Kiev against the anti-government (called ＆Maidan＊) demonstrators, and who fled back into their eight buses that had taken them there from Crimea, back now to Crimea. Yarosh＊s people blocked the buses at the town of Korsun and murdered some and injured others . This terrified the people in Crimea, which had voted 75% for the very person that the Obama Administration had just overthrown. That massacre was a key precipitating-event for the plebiscite that was then held in Crimea on 16 March 2014, at which over 90% of the residents voted for Crimea to rejoin with Russia, of which it had been a part until the Soviet leader in 1954 arbitrarily transferred Crimea to Ukraine. .. Right Sector thugs (now in plain clothes) were also behind the subsequent 2 May 2014 massacre of the new regime＊s peacefully demonstrating opponents inside the Trade Unions Building in Odessa 〞 the event that sparked the breakaway of yet another region of Ukraine: Donbass. .. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama wanted to control Ukraine because it has the longest border with Russia of any European country and would be ideal for placing missiles aimed at Moscow just a five minutes flight-time away. This was part of a plan that was started actually by U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush on the night of 24 February 1990 and which both Bill Clinton and Bush＊s son advanced, as did Obama and as will Hillary 〞 presumably to the plan＊s ultimate conclusion, war against Russia. .. It＊s a massive, decades-long, team-effort, on the part of America＊s billionaires and their allied billionaires around the world; and, if Clinton wins, then it will be culminated. Eric Schmidt is key to her success in it, and will probably benefit hugely from it, if the conquest can be carried out by non-nuclear means or by ＆bluffing＊ (which, of course, is being carefully gamed-out). But, just in case it goes nuclear, the people who are on the inside have already invested in nuclear bunkers for themselves and their friends and their friends＊ friends .

    "text": "On November 1, 2016, early voting polls in Florida indicate more than one-quarter of registered Republicans have cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton. Two states that the Democratic presidential nominee must win are North Carolina and Florida, which her campaign describes as checkmate states. She must carry the swing states to ensure the accumulation of electoral votes needed to be elected to the presidency.\nThe CNN polls in October indicated that Clinton had an 18 point lead over Donald Trump among early voters.\nCBS reports the percentages of Florida＊s Republicans who cast early votes break down as follows; 11 percent registered since 2012, 83 percent voted in the last presidential election, and six percent did not vote four years ago. Among registered Democrats the numbers were similar.\nEarly voting, in person or by mail, is underway in 37 states. Experts predict that more than 46 million people will have voted before next Tuesday, November 8.\nAs of November 2, at 12:56 a.m. EDT, The New York Times daily prediction is that Clinton has an 88 percent chance over Trump＊s 12 percent to win. Hers are down 1 percent and his are up 1. from the day before.\nHowever, the paper indicates that the ROP candidate could win, although it is as unlikely as a professional football kicker missing a 35-yard field goal.\nWritten by Cathy Milne\nSources:\nThe New York Times: Election Forecast; Who Will Be President?\n760 AM Radio: Early voting: More good signs for Clinton in key states\nTwitter Feed CNN : 17% of early GOP Voters Chose Clinton\nImage Courtesy of WEBN-TV＊s Flickr Page 每 Creative Commons License    #CMJournalist , clinton , Donald Trump , north carolina",

    "text": "With just four days left until election day, many Americans are still perplexed. Who should the people cast their vote for on November 8? 2016 has brought a variety of topics to the surface for both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. However, Americans seem to miss a lot of information from both parties during the debates and rallies. Each person is preoccupied with defending themselves or offending the other. Believe it or not, during all the drama there are clear proposals from both Clinton and Trump on several concerns.\nA Few Prominent Proposals: Education: When it comes to higher education, Clinton and Trump cannot be more opposites. Clinton introduced the New College Compact. This would allow students entering a four-year college, within their state, not have to borrow money for tuition, books, and fees.\nTrump has opposed the New College Compact and claims he would fight any proposal for debt-free public higher education.\nTaxes: However, both do see eye to eye on many tax related problems. Clinton and Trump promised the working middle-class Americans a massive tax reduction. Also, they both ensure that the wealthy will pay their fair share in taxes.\nGun Control: Another area that Clinton and Trump agree upon is gun control. This may come as a surprise for many, yet the similarities cannot be ignored. They both want to keep guns out of the hands of violent criminals and the severely mentally ill. They also want to expand background checks. Trump goes as far as suggesting ※that we empower all law-abiding gun owners to defend themselves because the police cannot be everywhere all the time.§ With either candidate, all gun owners rightfully able to bear arms will be entitled to do so, no-one is threatening to disarm anyone.\nImmigration: This is one of the most talked about topics among the presidential nominees. Within the first 100 days of office, Clinton says she will set forth a plan that will treat people with respect, fix the family visa backlog, end the three and ten-year bars, and protect American borders.\nTrump claims he will have Mexico pay for a wall on the Southern borders and end the catch and release process. Trump also explained that he will deport illegal immigrants, who have committed a crime, in one day.\nBy going to each of the candidate＊s website, people can see a complete copy of their goals, as president of the United States. Determining which nominee would be a better fit as the commander in chief, is an opinion based on how much or how little voters relate to each candidate＊s ideas.\nUnfortunately, getting acquainted with Clinton and Trump＊s prospective plans is not an easy task. There has been chaos from the very beginning with these campaigns. There has never been a dull moment, that is for sure. However, now is the time to become serious and to remember that the world is watching.\nBy Amy Weins\nEdited by Jeanette Smith\nSources:\nNASFAA: 2016 Presidential Candidates＊ Higher Education Proposals\nHillary Clinton.com: A Fair Tax System; Gun Violence Prevention; Immigration Reform\nDonald Trump.com: Tax Plan; Second Amendment Rights; Immigration\nFeatured Image Courtesy of Steven Bevacqua＊s Flickr Page 每 Creative Commons License\nTop Image Courtesy of Matt Wade＊s Flickr Page 每 Creative Commons License clinton , hillary , presidential election , Trump",

    "title": "Obama: Hillary Clinton Pardon Could Heal Divided Nation",
    "text": "Note to President Obama: a Hillary Clinton pardon could heal a divided nation. After all, if it was good enough for Richard Nixon, it is certainly good enough for Clinton. The difference being that Tricky Dicky was actually guilty of the crimes insinuated against him, whereas the former Secretary of State, who was thoroughly investigated and cleared of any criminal wrongdoing twice, continues to be maligned and persecuted by the right-wing establishment, as well as politicos with decades-old grudges who view the Clinton witch hunt as their opportunity to exact revenge on the woman who should be America＊s first female President of the United States , and proved it by carrying the nation＊s popular vote if not the antiquated electoral college.\nAs originally proposed by one-time presidential hopeful, Rev. Jesse Jackson, the nation should call upon President Barack Obama to issue a blanket pardon to the twice-exonerated Clinton, in order to call an end to the drawn-out attack on every aspect of the former New York senator＊s character once and for all. In the 21st century, it is unthinkable to believe that U.S. citizens are so narrow-minded and circumspect that they seek to stop an empowered, idolized public servant from holding the highest office in the nation simply because she is a woman.\nWhile it is abominable and heartbreaking to lend credence to this theory, there is strong evidence to support its existence, especially when considering some examples from other nations who have female world leaders:\n〞 Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (1966-77; 1980 to Oct. 31, 1984 (her assassination))\n〞 British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1979-90). Thatcher was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and first woman to have held the office.\n〞 Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (1969-74)\n〞 German Chancellor Angela Merkel (2005-present)\n〞 Queen Elizabeth II of United Kingdom (U.K.), Great Britain, and Northern Ireland (1952-present)\n〞 South Korean President Park Geun-hye (2013-present)\n〞 Prime Minister Theresa May of U.K., Great Britain, and Northern Ireland (2016-present)\n〞 Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed of Bangladesh (1996-2001; 2009-present)\nFrom countries great and small, these women and countless others have achieved the ultimate seat of power in their respective nations. Some of these countries have a long, storied legacy of woman leaders that spans decades and even generations, while others are relatively new to welcoming a female presence as their central figurehead. Nonetheless, women all over the globe have been given the opportunity to lead their countries into a new era and provide their citizens with a different perspective, with the glaring exception of the United States, a nation that could benefit immensely from female influence at the helm.\nPresidential pardons are not a foreign concept. Every U.S. president has the authority to grant pardons, which is also known as clemency, to anyone of their choosing. However, unlike most executive powers, presidential pardons are unchecked by Congress and cannot be blocked, overturned, or reviewed. The purpose of this power exists to help ease tensions, correct historic injustices, and heal political wounds. If any situation calls for its implementation, this scenario could not be more fitting. Yet, this authority does not come without controversy. In addition to President Gerald Ford＊s pardoning of Richard Nixon in 1974, other controversial acts of clemency include President Bill Clinton＊s pardon of Symbionese Liberation Army sympathizer and publishing heiress Patty Hearst in 2001, President Richard Nixon＊s offer of clemency to Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa in 1971, and President Jimmy Carter＊s commutation of Watergate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy＊s prison sentence in 1977.\nAs evidenced by the vitriol of the 2016 Campaign and subsequent General Election , a Hillary Clinton pardon by President Obama could be the only way to end the vicious cycle of recrimination and violence observed throughout the so-called Democratic process , which has encountered its own foibles and criticisms. Namely, the ongoing debate about the necessity of the electoral college and its all-or-nothing allotment, which many consider unjust and obsolete. Instead, many believe the winner of the popular vote should be elected as U.S. commander in chief, which would have resulted in President-elect Clinton occupying the Oval Office. In the aftermath of the controversial election results, a blanket pardon for the veteran politician could be the first step in healing a divided nation, which has truly demonstrated its fractured populace via the chaotic antics and disdainful actions observed throughout the extended 2016 Campaign cycle, as well as in the aftermath of its divisive conclusion.\nOpinion Written and Edited by Leigh Haugh\nSources:\nPersonal Opinions and Observations of the Author\nDetroit Free Press 每Obama Should Pardon Hillary Clinton, Jesse Jackson Says\nNew York Times 每Hillary Clinton, in Emotional Speech, Implores Supporters to Keep Believing in America\nMTV 每We Need Female Politicians Now More Than Ever\nWashington Post 每Here Are the Dozens of Democracies That Have Elected a Female Leader\nAll Article Images Courtesy of WikiMedia Commons 每 Creative Commons License clinton , Donald Trump , Hillary Clinton , jesse jackson , President Barack Obama , Presidential Pardons",

    "title": "Hustle at Hofstra With Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton",
    "text": "On a chilly and rainy night, American living rooms became filled with a presidential debate that would go down in history as one of the most anticipated in modern times. and for all the wrong reasons. Every televised debate seemed to be more about optics than substance, more about this guy than that guy.\nPresidential Debates: \nSome may remember the Kennedy-Nixon debate and the aftermath over Nixon＊s sweating on screen. There was the Bush-Dukakis optic of a towering George H.W. Bush over the diminutive Michael Dukakis. And few can forget the Benson-Quayle vice presidential debate and the, ※You＊re no John Kennedy§ line.\nFor some reason, the build-up to the Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton debate was different. Would Trump go off the rails and say some absolutely ridiculous claim that would doom his chances? Would Clinton＊s health be an issue under the strain of the moment? And what of the moderator? Would Lester Holt come off a Clinton shill, as many had accused the mainstream media of being? Yes, this was a weird countdown to the Hustle at Hofstra.\nDebate Results: In the end, this was more of a journeyman heavyweight than Ali-Frazier. Trump was the interrupting, aggrandizing, self-congratulatory man Americans have come to know 每 all style and no substance. Like Trump, Clinton did not break any new ground. She was still looking to win this election on the votes of women and minorities. Trump, still hoping to gather enough people, angry with the status quo, to sneak into the White House. Many saw nothing in the debate to swing them one way or the other.\nThe debate showed people more than what candidate they should choose to elect, but it showed citizens a reflection of themselves, the American people. It showed citizens that they have collectively failed as a nation. Failed to preserve the republic, and failed to demand a system that would encourage the best administrators to run this country. Instead, Americans were saddled with two combatants that will result in a divisive president, no matter who wins. As the debate progressed, both participants hit on many good points that were missed due to their personalities.\nThere were two points brought up, one by each. Clinton questioned why Trump would not release his tax returns. That is a problem. What is he hiding? The second point was made when Trump asked why her IT people would not testify before Congress about the email and servers. A legitimate question, considering her ties to the Clinton Foundation, as secretary of state.\nSo in the end, the debate was not a dud but a lesson; a lesson to all Americans that the people have failed. Failed to control the corporations who poison the republic with wads of cash; failed to demand changes to the nominating process, so that citizens can choose among the best-of-the-best to run this country; and failed to pay attention, as the nation was co-opted from the people by crony capitalism.\nYes, Americans have failed; they have failed the men and women in the mirror. It is time to remember John F. Kennedy＊s words, ※Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.§ For God sake, pay attention to the country.\nOpinion by John Carmody\n \nPresidential Debate: commission telecast 9/26/16\nImage Courtesy of ABC 每 Used With Permission    Hillary Clinton , Hustle at Hofstra , presidential debates , Trump",

    "text": "More Politicized Justice to Protect Hillary More Politicized Justice to Protect Hillary October 27, 2016, 9:04 am by Roger Aronoff Leave a Comment 0 \nBy: Roger Aronoff | Accuracy in Media \nA recently revealed connection between Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a local Virginia politician and the FBI exposes, at the very least, another deceptive conflict of interest that was likely intended to help protect the viability of Hillary Clinton＊s presidential ambitions. These politicians believe they can get away with such actions because they trust that they can count on a complicit mainstream media to cover for their corruption. \nA case in point is the funding McAuliffe arranged for Dr. Jill McCabe, the wife of the future deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe. McAuliffe steered nearly $500,000 from his political action committee, Common Good VA, and another approximately $200,000 from the Virginia Democratic Party to Mrs. McCabe for her state senate campaign in 2015. Her campaign had a total budget of $1.8 million, and according to The Washington Post, in 2015 the state allowed candidates to use campaign funds for personal expenses so long as the campaign was operating. \n※No, it＊s not at all a normal amount [of money],§ said State Senator Dick Black, the incumbent who defeated McCabe in 2015 and kept the seat, on the Steve Batton Show . ※In fact, the amount that was involved is comparable to what you would have in a full congressional, a hotly contested congressional race.§ Black, who served as a pilot for the Marines during the Vietnam War, was later the head of the Criminal Law Division at the Pentagon. \n※The amount of money that was put in was astounding,§ Black continued. ※It was four times as much as the Democrats had put into the former race when this was an open seat.§ At the time that Jill McCabe announced her campaign, her husband Andrew was running the Washington, D.C. field office of the FBI. He was later promoted to the number three position, and then promoted to deputy director. His wife＊s campaign failed, and, according to The Washington Post, Andrew McCabe avoided handling Virginia public corruption cases during her campaign and didn＊t ※participate in§ campaign events. \nYet, given that the main funder of his wife＊s campaign, Governor McAuliffe, is a long-time Clinton ally who chaired Hillary Clinton＊s 2008 presidential campaign and chaired the Democratic National Committee, Andrew McCabe should have recused himself from the Hillary Clinton investigation〞no matter at what level he was serving. \nAccording to a cutting Wall Street Journal editorial , ※All of this asks voters to believe that Mr. McCabe as the No. 3 official at the FBI had nothing to do with the biggest, most sensitive case at that agency. This strains credulity.§ It was the Journal that broke the story this week about McAuliffe steering money to McCabe. \nThe editorial continues, ※Before he became No. 3 at the FBI Mr. McCabe ran the bureau＊s Washington, D.C. field office that provided resources to the Clinton probe. Campaign-finance records show that 98% of the McAuliffe donations to Mrs. McCabe came after the FBI launched its Clinton probe.§ \nThree months after McCabe＊s defeat, her husband became the FBI deputy director helping to oversee the Clinton email case. Not only does this have the appearance of impropriety〞it doesn＊t pass the smell test. \n※So the Democratic Party actually suspected that this woman was a Republican because she hadn＊t been active in any politics,§ said Black. ※She came out of the blue, which was quite mysterious. Why this woman, why was she chosen?§ Black described how another Democratic Party operative had already filed to run for the state senate seat, but the party decided that Jill McCabe would be the candidate〞without holding a primary. \nAs we have reported, the whole FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s use of classified email and private server stinks〞and the fix was clearly in . Not only did the FBI grant immunity to five people deeply involved in the case, it also made a deal to destroy evidence on two witnesses＊ computers once it finished reviewing material found on them. ※Sources said the arrangement with former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills and ex-campaign staffer Heather Samuelson also limited the search to no later than Jan. 31, 2015,§ reported Fox News. ※This meant investigators could not review documents for the period after the email server became public〞in turn preventing the bureau from discovering if there was any evidence of obstruction of justice, sources said.§ \nIn addition, the FBI failed to empanel a grand jury to look into the case, instead relying on non-aggressive interviews which were not recorded. \nWe have long maintained that EmailGate is not just about hiding information from the public, but is also a national security scandal. The Obama administration is clearly using political considerations to determine who receives punishment for mishandling the nation＊s secrets. Among the latest WikiLeaks revelations is further proof that President Obama was well aware that Mrs. Clinton was doing government business from a private, unsecured server, though he denied it, and that staff members were scrambling to figure out how to contain the fallout. \nThe Washington Post reports that another government official who mishandled classified information, leaking it to the press, failed to escape judgment. Former Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman General James E. Cartwright＊s ※greatest mistake was not talking to reporters or lying about it; he failed to play the Washington game skillfully enough to avoid becoming a scapegoat for a system in which senior officials skirt the rules and then fall back on their political power to save them,§ writes Josh Rogin for the Post. He describes how Cartwright ※was a pariah to many of the Very Important People in Washington＊s national security elite.§ \nCartwright ※pleaded guilty to the felony charge of lying to the FBI during its investigation into the leaking of classified information about covert operations against Iran to two journalists§ and could face up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine, writes Rogin. \nBefore that, Cartwright was known as ※ Obama＊s favorite general .§ But clearly that is no longer the case, or presumably he would have gotten off scot-free, just like Hillary, from the highly politicized Obama Justice Department. Hillary＊s mishandling of classified material was part of her daily routine for years〞far more egregious than anything that Cartwright did. \nAs Rogin pointed out in the Post article, Cartwright spoke to The New York Times＊ David Sanger about the Stuxnet program designed to slow down Iran＊s quest for nuclear weapons. Sanger had previously ※had meetings on Iran with several other high-profile administration officials, including National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns and even Clinton herself. There＊s no evidence of any other Stuxnet leak investigations of high-level officials.§ \nBut only Cartwright is taking the fall. ※In his statement taking responsibility for lying to the FBI,§ writes Rogin, ※Cartwright asserted his motivations were patriotic. ＆My only goal in talking to the reporters was to protect American interests and lives; I love my country and continue to this day to do everything I can to defend it.＊§ We may have to wait for Cartwright＊s memoir to find out the rest of this story. \nIn 2013, the Times＊ Sanger said that the Obama administration was the ※most closed, control-freak administration§ he＊d ever covered. But Hillary got a pass, in order to run for the White House to succeed President Obama. We have reported on how this administration has systematically and to an unprecedented level targeted leakers and journalists . \nBut the whitewash of an FBI investigation into Mrs. Clinton＊s email practices is looking more and more like a cover-up. That the McCabes felt indebted to Clinton associate McAuliffe cannot be definitively proven, but it defies common sense to assume that they both were purely impartial about the investigation into Hillary. If only the mainstream media would do their job and report on the facts of this case, instead of simply lambasting Donald Trump and his supporters for his inartful comments. If only.

    "text": "*Articles of the Bound* / The Hillary Clinton File The Hillary Clinton File November 5, 2016, 6:37 am by Roger Aronoff Leave a Comment 0 \nAccuracy in Media \nOctober certainly lived up to its reputation as being a month for surprises in this year＊s presidential election, especially for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The media have done as much as they could to help minimize the damage, but a massive amount of new information came out that has confirmed and revealed a pattern of deceit, duplicity and corruption, unmatched in any presidential candidacy in modern times. \nOctober Surprises \nUntil this recent information made its way into the public consciousness, the narrative for this upcoming election was largely intact. Hillary Clinton, the most intelligent, qualified, experienced, compassionate, and yes, the first ever female candidate was headed for an historic win. Sure, she had some people who didn＊t find her honest or trustworthy, but that was just because they spent too much time watching Fox News or listening to conservative talk radio. Her opponent〞a crude, rude, undisciplined, tax dodging, female-groping, reality television star with a checkered business career〞was going down to defeat in historic fashion, while taking down what＊s left of the Republican Party he did so much to destroy. \nBut with just one week until the most anticipated, feared, dreaded, controversial, shocking and unpredictable campaign in history comes to an end, and we enter the uncharted waters of a post-election that, if the race is close, could be a period of massive civil unrest regardless of which candidate wins〞the narrative is in flux. For example, a Washington Post/ABC News tracking poll has shifted in one week from a 12-point lead by Mrs. Clinton, down to a one point lead. And as of November 1, Trump holds a one-point lead in that survey . Both sides largely view the other side＊s victory as the end of the world as we know it, and simply unacceptable. \nDespite the media＊s best efforts to hold off this late rally by Trump, the cumulative effect of these various October Surprises has dramatically changed the landscape. While some aren＊t complete surprises, they are corroboration and confirmation of a number of very damaging stories. First, we have the WikiLeaks revelations. At this point, with the latest release, there are more than 41,000 emails from what WikiLeaks is calling the Podesta file. John Podesta is a long-time Clinton associate who is the chairman of Hillary＊s presidential campaign. He also served as chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton and counselor to President Barack Obama. And he is the former president, and now chairman of the Center for American Progress, a far-left Washington think tank. \nThe latest batch of 2,500 of Podesta＊s emails has produced another major smoking gun, as if any more are needed. The New York Post is reporting that: \n※Hillary Clinton＊s campaign chairman directed her former chief of staff to ＆dump all those emails＊ the same day a bombshell report revealed Clinton＊s use of a private computer server while U.S. secretary of state, WikiLeaks revealed on Tuesday. \n※John Podesta sent the message to Cheryl Mills the evening of March 2, 2015, hours after the New York Times reported that Clinton may have violated federal records requirements by using the server, according to the latest batch of Podesta＊s hacked emails.§ \nThis sounds like intent to destroy evidence, and obstruct justice. \nIn these leaks we have learned much about how the Clinton Foundation leveraged Mrs. Clinton＊s position as secretary of state to benefit her and the foundation, to bring massive wealth to the Clintons and their cronies, as well as foreign governments and other entities seeking access and favors. We have learned that many people in high-ranking positions in the Obama administration were using their private email accounts to conceal what they wanted to keep hidden from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Here is a very handy list of 100 of the most revealing and damaging of the hacked WikiLeaks emails. They aren＊t all from Podesta. Some are from FBI documents, others are from Democratic National Committee leaks. \nWe continue to find out information from FOIA documents released by Judicial Watch , including a new batch of over 300 such documents that show how Hillary Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin exchanged classified materials over Mrs. Clinton＊s unsecured, home-brew server. According to Judicial Watch, these latest documents include: \n※According to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemptions cited in the documents obtained by Judicial Watch, three of the Clinton-Abedin email exchanges contained material ＆classified to protect national security.＊ \n※Also included in the newly obtained documents is an additional instance of the State Department doing special favors for a high-dollar Clinton Foundation donor. And the documents include instances of the distribution by State Department officials of Clinton＊s government schedule to members of the Clinton Foundation staff.§ \nProject Veritas, run by James O＊Keefe, has exposed the inner workings of the Democratic machine in action. It has documented direct ties between Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, a Clinton super PAC and far-left activist groups paying people to violently disrupt Donald Trump＊s campaign rallies, and help arrange voter fraud in various ways. This is criminal activity that is getting virtually no attention in the media, other than through sites such as Breitbart, and Sean Hannity on his Fox News and radio shows. The media, if they mention it at all, simply say that it comes from the ※discredited§ O＊Keefe, that the video has been edited, and that O＊Keefe has previously been convicted of a crime while doing some of his undercover videos. They ignore the substance, which is extremely damning. Photo by BrookingsInst \nThe FBI is responsible for yet another October Surprise. On October 28, FBI Director James Comey dropped a bombshell with just 11 days to go before the election. He announced in a letter to Congress that new information had come to his attention about additional emails that they were previously unaware of that may have bearing on the Hillary Clinton email probe that he had said was completed back in July. It turns out that there were some 650,000 emails from and to Hillary＊s top aide of approximately 20 years, Huma Abedin, the estranged wife of former New York Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner, who is under investigation by the FBI for alleged sexting with a minor. \nBefore that, the FBI summary of their investigation revealed that Clinton ※couldn＊t remember§ 40 times during her three-and-a-half hour interview with the FBI on the Fourth of July weekend. She couldn＊t remember, for example, if she had been briefed on protocols for handling classified material. According to the FBI summary, ※Clinton could not recall any briefing or training by State related to the retention of federal records or handling of classified information.§ \nThe Clinton Legacy from the ＆90s \nWhile Hillary Clinton＊s recent history has been plagued by scandal and failure, the recent debacles are not so different from the period of time that she and her husband spent in the White House back in the 1990s. We documented much of that corruption in the 1999 documentary, ※The Clinton Legacy,§ which we are re-releasing with this new report. \nWhile most people remember Bill Clinton＊s impeachment and scandals as being based on sex with an intern and lying about it under oath, there was more〞much, much more. FileGate, TravelGate, and Whitewater each exposed Clinton administration corruption wherein the administration inappropriately housed FBI files in the White House, worked with corrupt individuals under criminal investigation, and generally used the full force of government, including the Internal Revenue Service, to retaliate against dissenters or those they did not favor. \nChinaGate, which resulted in greater Chinese nuclear strike capabilities, foreshadowed the revelations regarding Russia＊s uranium purchase , and highlighted the dangers of the Clinton Foundation＊s ongoing foreign conflicts of interest. It involved the handing over of missile technology in exchange for cash to the Clintons and their cronies. \nWith the help of Reid Collins, a reporter and anchor for CBS News for 20 years, and at CNN for 10 years, we tell the story of those years. People forget how bad these scandals really were, and we at AIM believed that had these been on the table, not only would Bill Clinton have been impeached, he would have been removed from office as well. As it was, half the Senate voted to remove him from office, but the Democrats came to his rescue. \nNow both Democrats and the media are working on behalf of Hillary Clinton to obscure the facts surrounding a number of scandals which could undermine her bid for president. \nLibya and Benghazi \nAs we have noted, Hillary Clinton claimed a prominent position in the Libyan intervention which led to the overthrow of dictator Muammar Qaddafi. Her aide, Jake Sullivan, wrote that she had ※leadership/ownership/stewardship of this country＊s Libya policy from start to finish.§ \nDoes that mean that Mrs. Clinton had a part in sending weapons to the Libyan rebels? Citizens＊ Commission on Benghazi (CCB) member, and former CIA officer, Clare Lopez told WorldNetDaily that ※We have ample evidence the Libyan gun-running operation was a White House operation and that the State Department under Hillary Clinton ran the show.§ Many of these so called rebels were known al-Qaeda affiliated jihadist groups, which is why we called our first CCB report, ※ How America Switched Sides in the War on Terror .§ \nBut Hillary Clinton＊s involvement in Libya has been more than an embarrassment〞it has actually cost lives. The Obama/Clinton administration was offered a chance to negotiate Qaddafi＊s abdication under a white flag of truce, as the CCB revealed. But they refused the offer, choosing war instead, and thousands of Libyans died as a result. Later, when four Americans were killed in Benghazi on September 11 and 12, 2012, Hillary was peddling the lie that the attack was based on spontaneous demonstrations in response to a YouTube video called ※The Innocence of Muslims.§ She knew that it was, in fact, a planned terrorist attack by jihadis, and said so to her daughter, and top officials in both Libya and Egypt. She then lied to the family members of the dead Americans, telling them that we were going to get the filmmaker of ※The Innocence of Muslims,§ who she said was responsible for their deaths. \nEver since the West＊s intervention that prompted regime change concluded, Libya has devolved into a conflict-ridden haven for the Islamic State and other terrorists. AIM＊s Citizens＊ Commission on Benghazi has thoroughly documented this tragic blunder. \nRussian Reset \nMrs. Clinton＊s Russian reset hasn＊t fared much better. As we have reported, President Obama and Hillary Clinton＊s Russian re-set policy paved the way for Russian aggression in Syria and Ukraine, as well as ※Vladimir Putin＊s decision to give sanctuary to NSA defector Edward Snowden,§ whose leaks have helped ISIS. \nBack in 2014, Reuters admitted that the Russian reset had failed and that the ※Cold War§ was back . Now, with Mrs. Clinton running for president, the media portray her international experience as secretary of state as a grand success. The New York Times, in its January endorsement of Hillary , wrote that ※The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.§ They asserted that Hillary ※brought star power as well as expertise to the table.§ \nClinton Foundation Corruption \nOther things that Hillary Clinton brought to the table included a number of conflicts of interest and an endless string of donors who may have benefited from her term as secretary of state. As we reported, Peter Schweizer, author of Clinton Cash , wrote, ※Any serious journalist or investigator will tell you that proving corruption by a political figure is extremely difficult.§ He continues, ※＃That is also why investigators primarily look at patterns of behavior.§ \nIn the case of the Clintons, the pattern of behavior is stunning. We have called it ※ blatant, willful, and indisputable § due to the growing number of examples of favors that were done, and donations accepted, while Hillary was secretary of state. The Associated Press reported that ※More than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money〞either personally or through companies or groups〞to the Clinton Foundation.§ Hundreds of millions of dollars were involved. According to the AP, ※Clinton met with representatives of at least 16 foreign governments that donated as much as $170 million to the Clinton charity, but they were not included in AP＊s calculations because such meetings would presumably have been part of her diplomatic duties.§ \nIn 2015, the Clinton Foundation announced that it would amend four years of tax returns because of an error in how it reported income from foreign government donations, according to Breitbart. The years refiled just happened to include most of the years that Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State〞2010 through 2013〞and involved $20 million. \nWhile Trump University has garnered significant attention from the media, Laureate Education has received much less mainstream press attention. As Honorary Chancellor of Laureate Education, Bill Clinton received more than $16 million that he routed through a shell corporation, WJC, LLC, as we have reported . Then, ※more than $55 million American taxpayer dollars flowed out of Hillary Clinton＊s State Department to a non-profit run by Laureate CEO Douglas Becker.§ \nThe recent WikiLeaks documents pertaining to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta reveal that Mrs. Clinton was invited to a Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) event in Marrakesh, Morocco in 2014. However, the Moroccan King Mohammed VI pledged $12 million to CGI and the foundation under the condition that Hillary Clinton attend the conference herself. \nLongtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin writes in a November 2014 email that ※no matter what happens, she will be in Morocco hosting CGI on May 5-7, 2015. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this.§ \nUltimately, Mrs. Clinton did not attend〞but her husband and daughter did. According to The Daily Caller, the CGI event was funded by the Moroccan government-owned mining company OCP, which has been charged with serious human rights violations by the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice. ※Clinton vigorously supported the Moroccan King when she was Secretary of State and the U.S.-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure as Secretary of State,§ reports The Daily Caller. ※The mining company also contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to the charity＊s web site.§ \nAnd speaking of mining, this section wouldn＊t be complete without mention of the Uranium One deal. Breitbart reported that ※ According to Clinton Cash [the book by Peter Schweizer] , the total donations from Uranium One shareholders to the Clinton Foundation exceeded $145 million, in the run-up to Hillary Clinton＊s State Department approving the Rosatom deal, which gave Russia control over about 20 percent of U.S. uranium.§ The New York Times deserves credit for following up on Schweizer＊s reporting, and confirming his findings in a front-page story in 2015. \nThe Clinton Foundation has also received a number of donations from human (and women＊s) rights violating countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The Clintons have committed to not receiving additional donations from foreign governments, corporations, or U.S. companies should Hillary Clinton become president. But until then, the foundation remains a way for bad actors to purchase future influence over this presidential candidate. \nHillary also refused to discuss pay-for-play involving the Clinton Foundation〞and talked over Donald Trump when he tried to comment on it. ※＃I＊m thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation because it is a world renowned charity and I＊m so proud of the work that it does,§ said Hillary Clinton. ※I could talk for the rest of the debate.§ She touted the foundation＊s achievements, but refused to address the lingering scent of scandal. ※＃we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs for people around the world and in our own country,§ she said at the debate. In fact, Schweizer claims that only ※six percent goes to other charities,§ according to Breitbart. ※The other 94 percent is in this stew of marketing, and management, and travel expenses, and sort of all these obscure things, that it＊s really hard to dissect what is the end result of that 94 percent being spent.§ \nBut don＊t look to the mainstream media to broach these issues. Instead, the spotlight is on Trump. And those media elites who donate to presidential campaigns overwhelmingly support Mrs. Clinton. \nMedia Collaboration with Clinton and Obama \nDespite the need for a fair, balanced, and objective press, we have cited the fact that 96 percent of the journalist donations tracked by the Center for Public Integrity went to Hillary Clinton＊s campaign. Politico＊s Jack Shafer recounts how the WikiLeaks emails expose journalists trying to curry favor with the Clintons through compliments and sharing information about stories not yet published. ※Reading the emails, we witness CNBC/ New York Times contributor John Harwood slathering Podesta with flattery, giving him campaign advice and praising Hillary Clinton,§ writes Shafer. ※In another email, the Washington Post ＊s Juliet Eilperin offers Podesta a ＆heads up＊ about a story she＊s about to publish, providing a brief pre-publication synopsis.§ In addition, ※CNBC＊s Becky Quick promises to ＆defend＊ Obama appointee Sylvia Mathews Burwell.§ \nThe list of embarrassing〞and disturbing〞media cozying up to the Clintons goes on. ※POLITICO reporter Glenn Thrush sends Podesta a chunk of his story-in-progress ＆to make sure I＊m not [f〞每g] anything up,＊§ writes Shafer. ※Beyond WikiLeaks, a January 2015 Clinton strategy document obtained by the Intercept describes reporter Maggie Haberman〞then at POLITICO and now at the New York Times 〞as someone the campaign ＆has a very good relationship with,＊ and who had been called upon to ＆tee up stories for us before＊ and had never disappointed.§ Yet Shafer, as a member of the mainstream media, concludes that these Clinton-pandering media examples are fine〞so long as the resultant reporting is ※creditable work that is accurate and useful to readers.§ Shafer believes these reporters hit the mark, yet, as we have reported, some journalists question whether objectivity is even necessary or prudent during this election cycle. \nThe reporting about Hillary Clinton has been so biased that journalists can hardly congratulate themselves for an accurate and useful job well done. The scandals mentioned above were largely covered by the conservative media, with a few notable exceptions . \nYet media pundits such as ABC＊s George Stephanopoulos, who donated $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation , and journalists donating to the Clinton campaign, are working hard to disseminate false journalism which excuses or downplays these scandals. \nJust as the press panders to Hillary Clinton, so, too, the presidential candidate uses the many opportunities supplied by the mainstream media to pander both to the liberal elite and others watching this broadcast media love-fest. Consider, for example, the March 9 Democratic Debate featuring Univision＊s Jorge Ramos as a moderator. ※You＊re telling us tonight that if you become president you won＊t deport children who are already here?§ he asked Mrs. Clinton. ※And that you won＊t deport immigrants who don＊t have a criminal record?§ \nHillary answered emphatically ※Yes§ to both questions, engaging in what co-moderator Maria Elena Salinas called ※Hispandering.§ But the question of criminal records for illegals is moot; currently the Obama administration is releasing dangerous criminal illegal aliens with no intention of deporting them, we noted back in June. ※Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) told Adam Kredo of The Washington Free Beacon that ＆the administration is trying to suppress information about the release of some 86,000 criminal illegal immigrants who have committed 231,000 crimes in just the past two and a half years,＊§ we wrote. ※The administration is not deporting these criminals after they are released from U.S. prisons, reports Kredo.§ \nDuplicity \nAn open borders policy already in the making threatens the safety of average Americans. Yet Mrs. Clinton wants to continue Obama＊s lax immigration policies if, or when, she gains office. \nWhile Hillary may claim now that she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, she once said that the TPP ※sets the gold standard in trade agreements.§ Now, as a presidential candidate, she says, ※I oppose it now, I＊ll oppose it after the election, and I＊ll oppose it as president.§ \nYet Mrs. Clinton told Banco Itau that her ※ dream § was ※a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, sometime in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.§ Hillary said, in one of her many speeches to bankers, that she has both ※a public and a private position§ on Wall Street reform. Perhaps her ※open trade and open borders§ comment was yet another example of the presidential candidate holding a private opinion that is opposed to her public statements. Those speeches paid very well. Hillary collected nearly $22 million for 90 speeches in less than two years, between the time she left office as secretary of state until she announced she was running for the presidency. And that was just a fraction of the $153 million that she and Bill took in from speeches between the time they left the White House in 2001, and her announcement to run to get back into the White House. \nFor example, despite railing against Wall Street and the elite, she has taken millions from big donors〞and is indebted to them. ※Determined not to fall behind in the money race, Hillary Clinton ramped up her appeals to rich donors and shrugged off restrictions that President Obama had imposed on his fundraising team,§ reports The Washington Post this October. ※Even as her advisers fretted about the perception that she was too cozy with wealthy interests, they agreed to let lobbyists bundle checks for her campaign, including those representing some foreign governments, the [WikiLeaks] emails show.§ By the end of September, the Post reports, Mrs. Clinton had raised $1.14 billion. ※Unlike Obama, Clinton fully embraced super PACs from the very beginning of her race, helping pull in larger checks from donors than the president did.§ \nHillary Clinton has lied again and again. One of her most notable lies is about the national security scandal that is EmailGate, in which Mrs. Clinton not only used a private email server for her business as secretary of state, deleting half of the emails, but also sent and received classified information through that server. She demonstrably placed national security secrets at risk in order to hide her affairs from the public, yet FBI Director James Comey decided not to recommend prosecution . The fix was in . So why did Comey bring the case back up with just 11 days until the election? Several reports suggested that FBI agents who were furious at Comey＊s July announcement that he was recommending against an indictment, have now threatened to go public with the new information about Ms. Abedin＊s emails unless he agreed to do it himself. \nWhile the search for smoking guns implicating Hillary Clinton in criminal activity continues, through a mountain of emails, there are more than enough smoking guns hiding in plain sight. In a way, the endless search for a single smoking gun clouds the issue and makes it seem as if nothing consequential enough has so far been found. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nThe record of Clinton scandal, for both of the Clintons, extends back through a number of administrations. It wasn＊t possible to cover all of the glorious legacy of Bill and Hillary Clinton in this one report. I encourage you to watch our documentary, ※The Clinton Legacy,§ which exposes the sordid truth about several of the real Clinton scandals when they occupied the White House back in the 1990s.

    "text": "FBI Director Confirms that Hillary Lied, and Mishandled Classified Material FBI Director Confirms that Hillary Lied, and Mishandled Classified Material November 8, 2016, 11:27 am by Roger Aronoff Leave a Comment 0 \nBy: Roger Aronoff | Accuracy in Media \nOn Sunday, FBI Director James Comey sought to put a cap on the bottle he opened on October 28 when he announced that the FBI was once again investigating Hillary Clinton＊s emails, based on a device they had discovered containing what turned out to be approximately 650,000 emails. The device was the shared computer of sexting pervert and former congressman Anthony Weiner and his long suffering wife, Huma Abedin, top aide to Hillary Clinton and a woman with deep ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. \nComey caused an uproar in the campaign, on both sides of the aisle. Democrats and their allies in the media were outraged that Comey would drop this bomb into the campaign with 11 days until the election, and not explain the urgency or the substance of his findings. Many Republicans, and their allies, who were outraged by Comey＊s conclusions back in July〞namely that Hillary Clinton was guilty of serious violations of the law, but that he didn＊t believe that she had any criminal intent, nor that ※any reasonable prosecutor§ would attempt to prosecute the case against her〞were saying that maybe Comey was going to implicate Hillary in serious criminal activity after all. He wouldn＊t have reopened this matter, they believed, if he didn＊t have something new and serious that he had seen. \nNow, the roles are reversed again, with Democrats claiming that Comey＊s latest statement represents a complete vindication for Hillary, while Republicans are questioning the timing and point of the whole exercise. Did the FBI, even with their high-tech reading devices, actually go through 650,000 emails in a week, and conclude that there is no there there? And why is the State Department only able to process 500 emails per month? The wheels of justice seem to turn at whatever pace the Democrats need them to. \nI have a bit of a different take. In the November 6 letter to Congress, Comey stated: \n※I write to supplement my October 28, 2016 letter that notified you the FBI would be taking additional investigative steps with respect to former Secretary of State Clinton＊s use of a personal email server. Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation. During that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State. \n※Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.§ \nWhile Comey did, in fact, argue back in July that he was not recommending an indictment or prosecution of Hillary, he also drew other ※conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.§ He had concluded that she lied when she said that she hadn＊t sent or received classified materials on her private, unsecured server. She lied when she said that nothing that she sent or received was marked classified. She lied when she said that she only used one device, when in fact she used at least 13 devices, at least two of which were destroyed by hammers. And she lied when she said that she had turned over all of her work-related emails. No, in fact Comey said that there were ※thousands§ of work-related emails they found that she had not turned over. You can watch here to see Comey draw all of these ※conclusions§ back in July. \nThis is what the Clinton campaign is wearing as a badge of complete exoneration, and a closing of the books on her so-called email scandal, which is actually a national security scandal. As we have often pointed out, others have gone to jail, been fined, lost their security clearances and were run out of public life for far less egregious examples of mishandling classified material. \nAndy McCarthy, the former U.S. Attorney who successfully prosecuted the Blind Sheikh for his involvement in the first World Trade Center bombing, argued back in July that Comey basically rewrote the law. Comey ※conceded that former Secretary Clinton was ＆extremely careless＊ and strongly suggested that her recklessness very likely led to communications (her own and those she corresponded with) being intercepted by foreign intelligence services.§ \nMcCarthy added that ※Comey recommended against prosecution of the law violations he clearly found on the ground that there was no intent to harm the United States.§ \n※In essence,§ wrote McCarthy, ※in order to give Mrs. Clinton a pass, the FBI rewrote the statute, inserting an intent element that Congress did not require. The added intent element, moreover, makes no sense: The point of having a statute that criminalizes gross negligence is to underscore that government officials have a special obligation to safeguard national defense secrets; when they fail to carry out that obligation due to gross negligence, they are guilty of serious wrongdoing. The lack of intent to harm our country is irrelevant. People never intend the bad things that happen due to gross negligence.§ \nBut this has been a corrupt process. The fix was in . It had to be to protect President Obama as well, who knowingly exchanged emails with Hillary on her private server. As Politico pointed out , ※President Barack Obama used a pseudonym in email communications with Hillary Clinton and others, according to FBI records＃§ Those FBI records, released in late September, confirmed what McCarthy had earlier predicted: ※As I explained in February,§ wrote McCarthy, ※when it emerged that the White House was refusing to disclose at least 22 communications Obama had exchanged with then-secretary Clinton over the latter＊s private e-mail account, we knew that Obama had knowingly engaged in the same misconduct that was the focus of the Clinton probe: the reckless mishandling of classified information.§ \nIt is possible that America will be electing someone as president on Tuesday who has committed serious crimes that could all be wiped away by a presidential pardon. The media＊s failure to accurately cover this story could very well be the cause of a major constitutional crisis, the likes we＊ve never witnessed before.

    "text": "Donations to Clinton Foundation dry up as Hillary no longer has a ＆product to sell＊ November 22, 2016 Google + Donations to the Clinton Foundation nose-dived last year amid Hillary Clinton＊s presidential run, pay-to-play allegations, internal strife and a black mark from a charity watchdog.\nContributions fell by 37 percent to $108 million, down from $172 million in 2014, according to the group＊s latest tax filings. \nThe cash plummeted as Hillary Clinton left the nonprofit in April 2015 after announcing her ill-fated candidacy. The foundation became a major issue in the race , with Donald Trump vowing to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate it. \nWhether that effort will go forward is not clear. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), head of the House Oversight Committee, has indicated a probe into the foundation will continue. \nNot only did contributions drop, but so did revenue the Clintons brought in from speeches. That income fell to $357,500 from $3.6 million in 2014. \nBy the time the foundation＊s Clinton Global Initiative held its annual conference in September 2015, many donors had bailed, including Samsung and ExxonMobil. \nDonna Shalala, the former Health and Human Services secretary who was brought in to run the charity last year, suffered a stroke after the CGI meeting. \nThe foundation had been rocked by internal divisions after daughter Chelsea Clinton took a more active role in the organization in 2013, when the group was renamed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. \nEric Braverman, a pal of Chelsea＊s, was brought in to run the group, but he clashed with Bruce Lindsey, a senior adviser in the Clinton administration who had been CEO and became board chairman. \nBraverman departed in January 2015 after 18 months, receiving a $330,000 payout, according to the tax filings. Shalala replaced him. \nThe Clinton Foundation refused to comment, but Shalala told The Chronicle of Philanthropy last month that the foundation had taken in money pledged in earlier years but those donations were recorded on earlier tax filings.",

    "text": "Oh, the politics are strong with this one. FBI Director James Comey just sent out a letter to the Republican Congressional Committee informing them that the FBI will be looking into more of Hillary Clinton＊s emails. The discovery of the new emails was ※in connection with an unrelated case.§ \nAs Think Progress points out, all the letter really means is there are emails that were discovered that the FBI had not reviewed. It doesn＊t mean a case is being ※re-opened.§ This does not say the FBI will be reexamining the information of the previous investigation. And, it doesn＊t mean that all of a sudden criminal charges are going to be forthcoming. It means nothing, except, the FBI needs to read a few more emails that were missed in the previous investigation. \nEven Comey says in his letter: \n※The FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.§ \nRead Republican James Comey＊s letter, here: \nYet, the reality of this statement is lost on not only major media outlets who are reporting that the case has been ※reopened,§ but also our politicians. Paul Ryan＊s response takes the cake, though. The Republican Speaker of the House went full knee-jerk with this one. He said in a statement : \n※Yet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame. She was entrusted with some of our nation＊s most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information. This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators. I renew my call for the Director of National Intelligence to suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved.§ \nSo, 11 days before our presidential election, we＊ve had the FBI Director, who happens to be a Republican, release an ambiguous letter which touches on an unsubstantiated scandal for which the Democratic presidential candidate came out of clean as a whistle because charges couldn＊t be justified. And now we＊ve had the Speaker of the House call for the candidate＊s intelligence briefings to be suspended ※until this matter is fully resolved.§ \nWhich, by the way, the FBI Director says he ※cannot predict how long it will take to complete this additional work.§ \nYeah, ok. Like this doesn＊t have political ploy written all over it. How pathetic. \nFeatured image via Getty Images/Win McNamee/Staff Share this Article!",

Probably the hackneyed political groan-inducer dreamed up by Liz Cheney for her daughter. \nFor inexplicable reasons, Liz Cheney 每 daughter of America＊s most detestable former vice president, Dick 每 decided to staple a bunch of pieces of office scrap paper onto her daughter and send her to school as ※Hillary Clinton＊s deleted emails.§ Ugh. \nOn social media, proud mom Liz even boasted about the costume.

The misogynists on the Right have questioned her health, her stamina, and everything in between. That is, of course, code for ※the little woman doesn＊t belong in the Oval Office.§ However, one Texas Republican has taken the misogyny to a whole other level. \nMeet Sid Miller, the Agriculture Commissioner for the state of Texas. He is also a former lawmaker. Miller, like most Republicans, doesn＊t make his hatred for Hillary Clinton any secret. Instead, he somehow thought that it was perfectly appropriate to take to Twitter and express his feelings in a most disgusting way while tweeting about the polls. Miller＊s tweet reads: \n※TRUMP 44 Cunt 43,§ punctuated with a cheering ※Go Trump Go!§ \nIn the predictable firestorm after, Miller tried to make the public believe that his account was hacked. Miller＊s staff hastily relesed this defense of his post: \n※The campaign was retweeting information today and inadvertently retweeted a tweet that they were not aware contained a derogatory term.

Commissioner Miller finds the term vulgar and offensive and apologizes to anyone who may have seen it.§ \nThere＊s a problem with that, though: The tweet was not a retweet. It was simply a tweet. Therefore, either Sid Miller himself or someone on his staff wrote this: \nNaturally, Miller is Donald Trump＊s number one man in Texas, according to the Texas Tribune . No surprise there. Further, Miller is no stranger to making tasteless and offensive jokes with regards to Hillary. Here is one that is just a few hours old as of this writing: \nThat tweet written in reference to the fact that the reason Hillary＊s emails are in the news again is because of disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner＊s sexting scandals. \nSo, in other words, this Sid Miller character is the perfect Donald Trump supporter 每 a misogynistic and deeply ignorant asshat who can＊t stand the idea of losing to a woman. \nFeatured image via screen capture from The Daily Beast Share this Article!",

However, just like FBI Director James Comey＊s letter to Republicans, it will be used by Clinton＊s opponents 每 particularly Trump＊s campaign 每 to fan the flames of ※scandal.§ \nThe question on everyone＊s mind is: Why? Why tweet this? And why tweet this just one week before an election that has already been marred with too many false scandals and misleading announcements? \nThe decision is baffling and unprecedented.

Former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder 每 a staunch Democrat 每 called Comey an ※honorable man§ who made a massive mistake. Now that assessment seems far too kind. The FBI is dumping opposition research to the public that hurts Hillary Clinton and favors Donald Trump. \nNot that the FBI Records Vault has been completely silent about Trump 每 but when it does speak about him, its tone is much more deferential. If the FBI＊s policy is to keep politics out of it, they are only achieving that when it comes to Trump. Two days previously, it tweeted a brief write up about Donald Trump＊s father. It describes him a ※philanthropist§ and the release appears mostly harmless. Fred C. Trump: Fred C. Trump (1905-1999) was a real estate developer and philanthropist.

This imbalance is so clear that it stretches the imagination to the breaking point to believe it was done on accident. \nAs the race tightens in the closing week of the election, the fact that a government agency would repeatedly throw its weight behind one candidate over another 每 and do so in a way that is inherently dishonest 每 is infuriating. The damage being done to the FBI＊s claim to objectivity is possibly irrevocable. \nFeatured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images Share this Article!",

    "text": "Scott Walker may be the governor of Wisconsin but Scott Walker is not a smart man. \nJust one week until Election Day, Walker decided he would use his social media account to help get Donald Trump elected. Instead, he gave every single Democrat in the country more than enough of a reason to vote for Hillary. Oops. \nOn his Twitter account, Walker tweeted a photo of Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama embracing, he captioned the moment ※If you like the past 8 years, vote Hillary Clinton.§ If you like the past 8 years, vote @HillaryClinton . pic.twitter.com/cQEtIgPsEz \n〞 Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) November 1, 2016 \nIn Walker＊s right-wing bubble that may be a stinging critique. To most of America, that＊s a great reason to vote Hillary. President Obama is currently seeing his favorability ratings surging. His presidency, and the accomplishments he＊s made during it, are very popular. At this moment, Gallup found 54 percent of Americans said they approved of Obama. His popularity outstrips Republican icon Ronald Reagan at the same time during his presidency. \nLots of people like the past 8 years under Obama . \nThe internet was bemused by Walker＊s tone-deaf plea. It seems like this could literally be a Clinton campaign tweet given Obama＊s approval rating. https://t.co/oHi573bllj",

    "text": "Donald Trump＊s merry band of supporters are surely not known for being the brightest crayons in the box. If anything, they tend to be a dull gray. The GOP nominee himself has even bragged about his loyal following of ※poorly educated§ dumbasses from across the country. His most fervent backers tend to have shoe sizes with larger numbers than their IQs. \nHowever, what Trump＊s followers are known for is their tendency to plan for retaliation if Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election on Tuesday. They have promised a civil war and bloodshed if Trump loses, which they are convinced could only happen if the election is rigged. When you combine these two traits, a penchant for violence and good old-fashioned stupidity, the result can sometimes be terrifying. Other times, it can be downright laughable. \nThis would be a prime example of the latter. \nMeet John. John vehemently supports Trump and his plan to ※Make America Great Again.§ Fearing a Clinton presidency, he has decided that if she wins the White House, he will have no choice to engage in an act of ※civil disobedience.§ You know, to show the government that he means business and all. Consequently, this brilliant man has managed to come up with the dumbest act of ※civil disobedience§ ever. \nSo just what does John the genius plan to do? He＊s going to block the drive-thru at McDonald＊s. After all, this is where all the illegal immigrants are working. That＊s it. That＊s his scheme in its entirety. Blocking the drive-thru at McDonald＊s.

But despite the fact that the majority of them are idiots, it doesn＊t take a rocket scientist to fill out a ballot. These people will be voting. The only way to keep these racist morons from deciding the fate of the country is for Democrats to turn out in droves on Tuesday and defeat Trump in a landslide＃even if it does mean that grabbing breakfast at McDonald＊s may take a little longer than usual on Nov. 9 due to a crazy guy blocking the drive-thru. \nFeatured image via Twitter",

Former Congressman Joe Walsh, who, like Donald Trump, enjoys Twitter WAY more than he should, tweeted this on November 1: \nAnother shocking GOP turn is from Ted Cruz, who just a few short months ago, during his speech at the RNC, refused to endorse Trump, but just today he hopped on Trump＊s plane to go campaign for him in Iowa. This, after Trump accused Cruz＊s father of killing JFK and also said horrible things about his wife. Remember that ※baked bean teeth§ comment Trump made? Yeah. Just plain nasty. \nIt＊s really unfortunate that Cruz caved, but the GOP is so terrified of losing control, that they are willing to forget their own pride and pull out all the stops to keep Clinton out of office. \nWatch Seth Meyers break it all down.

    "text": "Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \nSo much for the media narrative that there is a so-called ※enthusiasm gap§ between Clinton and Trump. Watching a Florida crowd roar as Hillary Clinton delivers a powerful speech in a downpour shows just how seriously people are taking this election. Clinton voters are just as motivated for her as Trump＊s are for him, perhaps more so. \nClinton was in Broward County, a crucial Democratic stronghold in what could be the deciding state of the election. The weather wouldn＊t cooperate , with intense rains off-and-on in the lead up to the event, but it didn＊t dissuade rally goers. By the time Hillary got up to the stage, the crowd was soaked but the atmosphere was electric. After a brief moment of sunshine, the rain returned in force. Hillary kept going.

The mood was positive. It was everything that Donald Trump and his allies in the media claim you don＊t see at a Clinton rally. And it was in Florida, the state that could put Hillary over the top and the state that Trump must win to even have a hope of being elected. Watching Hillary＊s rally probably sent a chill down the spines of Trump＊s campaign staff. \nHilariously, just yesterday, Trump got caught lying about the turnout of his own rally. According to his own account, ※thousands§ of people were left outside of his rally because it was too packed. Reporters on the scene debunked this claim instantly. Trump says \"thousands and thousands of people\" are standing outside. I am outside. There are maybe 500 people. pic.twitter.com/qKRNQYqBid \n〞 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) November 5, 2016 \nThis is not to say that Democrats can get complacent. In the closing weeks of the election, the polls have become disturbingly close. RealClearPolitics puts Clinton only 1 point ahead of Trump in Florida. It＊s clear that this race will be won or lost based on which side＊s supporters get to the voting booth. For Clinton, it＊s a good sign that Floridians are showing that they will come out for her rain or shine. \nFeatured image via Twitter",

There＊s a lot on the line that goes far beyond politics. It goes into the character of the candidates, and their fitness for office. In GOP nominee Donald Trump, we have an unstable reality star who is dangerously unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and nothing more than a bigoted demagogue who has managed to fleece half the nation into believing his authoritarian ways will solve all their problems. \nOn the other hand, we have Hillary Clinton taking up the mantle for the Democrats. She will take the nation forward into a brighter future, reassure and protect our allies, and continue the social and economic progress that President Obama has done so much for. We＊re talking about a woman who has been First Lady, a United States Senator, and Secretary of State. She performed admirably in all of those roles. \nAnd now, at the end of what has been a bruising, ugly campaign thanks to the dangerous rhetoric of one Donald J. Trump, we have forgotten one thing: We are witnessing history. Hillary is the first woman to shatter the glass ceiling to become the nominee of one of America＊s two major parties. It＊s easy to lose sight of all of that in such a crazy election season, but we have much to celebrate. \nLuckily, Hillary＊s campaign didn＊t lose sight of that, and they released an amazingly inspiring video that chronicled her meteoric rise to the Democratic Party＊s nomination for President. It goes from the announcement, through the primaries, and through the ridiculousness of having to run against Donald Trump. And here we are, waiting with bated breath on the eve of this stressful election, and Hillary has given us the priceless gift of something to celebrate in a world that feels quite bleak right now.

Would you consider appointing Obama?§ \nClinton replied enthusiastically, ※Wow! What a great idea! Nobody has ever suggested that to me! Wow! I love that! Wow!

Bush who＊s been an active advocate for Clinton this year; Kurt Campbell, Clinton＊s assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs when she was in the job; Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state during Bill Clinton＊s first term and a longtime friend of the Clintons who＊s now the president of the Brookings Institution; and James Stavridis, the retired admiral who earlier this summer made it into consideration as the sleeper pick to be her running mate. \nDespite being widely known for his numerous gaffes, Biden chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before joining the Obama Administration, and is one of the most experienced and respected Democrats on the world stage. \nHe is coming to what would be the close of a 44-year career in Washington, first with six terms in the Senate and then two terms as President Barack Obama＊s closest adviser, and has expressed his desire to retire. \nIn addition to his resum谷, Biden would bring to the table a ※star power§ none of Hillary＊s other picks could. \nTo be fair, no one could possibly make a worse Secretary of State than Hillary herself, though Joe Biden might be a close second.",

    "text": "0 comments Actions of this magnitude from a are simply DEVASTATING! According to a late-night report, The White House is taking drastic action in light of the FBI＊s reopening of Hillary Clinton＊s email investigation. The Obama Administration has stated that they had not prior knowledge of the new investigation. It is also being reported that The Department of Justice was not notified, either. Some theorize that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is working to regain its reputation as an organization of integrity. By choosing not to inform The White House or The Department of Justice, the FBI could have been trying to prevent intervention from these two powerhouses. Now, the public knows that the investigation has been restarted, and it will be harder for pro-Hillary government organizations to play politics with the issue. The FBI＊s stunning news has caused The White House to take action, according to a recent report from Redflagnews . Late Friday night, all of Barack Obama＊s scheduled campaign appearances on behalf of Hillary Clinton were CANCELLED! Reportedly, all of the pre-planned events have been removed from the schedule (see below.) Given that President Obama＊s approval ratings are at an all-time high, a mass cancellation of this nature is certainly devastating to a Democrat Presidential hopeful like Hillary Clinton. For a popular, two-term President to distance himself from a Campaign, during the final ten days of the Election, is earth-shattering. Take a look at the following graphic: Will the Hillary Clinton Campaign have time to recover from these shocking revelations? Unfortunately, for Hillary, this may not be the last shoe to drop. Julian Assange of WikiLeaks has said that his next release will be the one that will definitely incriminate Hillary. Additionally, group like Anonymous are hinting that they also have blockbuster information to be released soon. Has the ※October Surprise§ been replaced by the ※November Surprise?§ It appears that Hillary Clinton is about to find out. Related Items",

You are likely familiar with Huma, as she is a regular on the campaign trail with Hillary, and has also been in the news for years as the wife of Anthony Weiner, the embattled former Congressman who is perpetually accused of sexting improprieties. Reportedly, the FBI is reopening its investigation of Hillary＊s private email practices after finding evidence of Huma＊s involvement on one of Anthony Weiner＊s electronic devices. It is a small world, isn＊t it? Another Clinton employee, a name that you may not be familiar with, is popping up in the news lately for reasons that are startling, to say the least. Justin Cooper is an Information Technology worker who is reported to have set up Hillary＊s private email server. Recently, he even testified before a House Committee, saying that he extracted information from Clinton-related smart devices before ※smashing them to bits.§ It is said that Cooper＊s testimony is the ※most informative we have heard yet.§ Judge Andrew Napolitano has expressed concern over Cooper＊s access to this information, among other things, as Cooper did not hold a Security Clearance. ※He was an employee of the Clinton family and of the Clinton Foundation, and he had complete and total access to the Clinton emails, and he had no security clearance,§ Judge Napolitano explained on ※Varney & Co.§ today.

Hillary LIES In First Press Conference While A LEAKED PHOTO From Her Airplane Reveals The Truth \n0 comments Hillary is trying to present a strong front but the truth continues to emerge, in VIDEO and in PHOTOS! Hillary was traveling to Iowa when news broke of the FBI＊s newly-reopened investigation of her email practices. Her plane sat on the tarmac for thirty minutes before she emerged, and, of course, the media was hungry for a statement. Last night, the press got their wish, as Hillary tried to appear strong in her first press conference following the bombshell news. Watch Hillary＊s statement below: \nMostly, Hillary is echoing her Campaign Manager, John Podesta, who is calling for the release of more information from the FBI. \nRight out of the gate, Hillary is already lying in an attempt to minimize the damage that this new investigation is causing. \nShe clearly states in the video above that the FBI sent the investigation announcement to Republicans in Congress. As a former Senator, Hillary knows this to be untrue, and she is trying to paint the issue as a partisan attack. Fact check: Contrary to what Clinton said, Comey sent letter to both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. @benyc \n〞 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) October 28, 2016 \nMultiple media sources have reported that the FBI found new information while investigating the sexting scandal of former Congressman Anthony Weiner. Weiner is married to Hillary＊s top aide, Huma Abedin. When asked about the reports, Hillary responded: \n※You know, we＊ve heard these rumors. We don＊t know what to believe and I＊m sure there will be even more rumors that＊s why it＊s incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what they＊re talking about because, right now, your guess is as good as mine and I don＊t think that＊s good enough.§ \nHillary is trying to appear defiant and in control. But, speaking of Huma Abedin, take a look at this leaked photo from inside of Hillary＊s airplane after the news had broken: Image surfaces of Huma Abedin crying on plane as Clinton Campaign finds out the FBI has re-opened the email investigation. #HillarysEmails pic.twitter.com/2yIUgiYOsV \nWe hate to see a lady crying, Huma, but when the company you keep includes Anthony Weiner, sometimes you have good reasons to cry. Perhaps Hillary＊s Campaign is not so strong after all. Related Items",

    "text": "The FBI found something, but no one had any idea it would be THIS BIG! Huma Abedin clearly never knew what Anthony Weiner had been up to on his electronic devices. That, perhaps, is the understatement of 2016. Allegedly, he was sexting countless women, some of them underage. Some of the pictures that he sent to other women were selfies that revealed his family life. The revelations are disturbing and merit investigations of their own. Given the bizarre nature of Anthony Weiner＊s digital habits, who would have ever dreamed that the 2016 Presidential Election would be rocked by the far out notion of critical governmental information on a pervert＊s device. No wonder Huma was seen crying on Hillary＊s airplane. Huma Abedin, reportedly, says that she has no idea how the emails ended up on her estranged husband＊s devices. Could Huma, and her boss, Hillary, be setting Anthony Weiner as a scapegoat? It sounds like something they might do. Perhaps more shocking is the massive amount of emails found on Weiner＊s laptop. According to The Washington Post, FIVE DIGITS worth of emails are being researched. That indicates a minimum of 10,000 messages that could implicate Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton, and their new best friend, Anthony Weiner. Oddly enough, Abedin was not a regular user of the device in question. Perhaps the messages were moved there as part of a backup process? Maybe Huma did not have her device family sharing settings configured properly. At this time, Officials do not believe that any of the messages are duplicates. The FBI will certainly use programs designed to ※dedup§ or weed out duplicates. Any email messages that remain will be examined to determine criminality. Is this new investigation enough to bring down the person who many believe is on course to be the first female President of the United States of America? The irony of a female Presidential candidate being investigated because of a pervert male former Congressman is not lost on me.",

One year ago, we all that that Donald Trump was just being funny, just being Trump, when he said that Hillary Clinton was showing poor judgement in letting Huma Abedin, wife of ※perf sleaze§ Anthony Weiner have access to government information. Trump called the couple a security risk, but again, we thought he was just making fun of them. As it turns out, Donald Trump＊s words were eerily prophetic. Unless you have been hiding under a rock, you have heard by now that the FBI is reopening the investigation of Hillary Clinton＊s email problems after finding evidence on devices at Anthony Weiner＊s home. Earlier, we reported that FBI Director James Comey had tricked Obama＊s Department of Justice and the Clintons in sending the investigation announcement letter to Congress. Some believe that Comey was attempting to force the DOJ to issue a warrant so that his agents can start reading the 10,000+ emails on Weiner＊s device. \nHere Is How FBI Director Comey BAMBOOZLED The DOJ, CONGRESS, And The CLINTONS All At Once \nNow, Anthony Weiner has spoken and he may have made Comey＊s job even easier, while completely bypassing the Department of Justice altogether. \nAccording to reports, Weiner has given permission for the FBI to access all of the information on his electronic devices, including his wifi router. . @BretBaier emails Chris Wallace while he＊s on air: Weiner has given FBI permission to search computer so no warrant needed. @FoxNewsSunday \n〞 Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) October 30, 2016 I emailed that 2 sources say Weiner is cooperating w/ FBI- & co-owned laptop.

If there is criminality found on Weiner＊s devices, they have a shot at it. \nIs there anything that the Department of Justice or the Clintons can do? \nTime will tell, but many believe that WikiLeaks and others are about to drop more incriminating evidence on Hillary later this week. \nComey may have saved himself.

    "text": "0 comments If you think Anthony Weiner＊s perverted antics were bad, wait until you see this! They have been together for decades, and while the truth has trickled out, technology has opened the floodgates. Enter Anonymous. The hard-to-define hacking group is doubted by many though they often get things exactly right. Their ideas about Huma Abedin, Hillary＊s top assistant, have enough merit to be worth a look, though what you see may frighten you. Allegedly, Huma has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, as her mother is a member of the Brotherhood＊s female counterpart. No question, she is tied to Saudi Arabia, as she was raised there. She was born in the United States, and at age two, her family moved to Saudi. Huma returned at age 18, then started her intern career with Hillary Clinton at the age of twenty. She worked for her mother＊s magazine, a Jihadist publication that promotes Sharia law. The Muslim World League funds the Abedin family business, and they also funded al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. Who is Human Abedin, in truth? The video below from Anonymous reveals more: \nWith news of Huma＊s estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, dominating the news recently, much is being presented in the news media on Weiner and Abedin＊s connection to Hillary Clinton, with the ongoing FBI investigation being primary. \nAs you may expect, Anonymous, as a group, joins WikiLeaks in their desire to expose the corruption of Hillary Clinton. Conflicts of interest, political scandals, money laundering, pay-for-play on an international scale, and more are the focus on Anonymous. \nThe amount of information that is available on Hillary Clinton is intimidating, as her career has run for decades. \nTake a look at the video below, also from Anonymous, and consider how she and Huma Abedin have found themselves in their current set of controversial circumstances.",

Hackers exposed her secrets then her husband＊s sex scandal opened the floodgates＃ Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton＊s top assistant for years, has perhaps become the most significant? figure in the final weeks of the 2016 Election. Born in the United States, Abedin＊s family moved to Saudi Arabia when she was two. At age 18, she returned to the United States, and, in 1996, at age 20, started interning for Hillary Clinton. From 2002-2008, she also worked for her mother＊s radical Muslim magazine, the Journal for Muslim Minority Affairs. Reportedly, the Journal advocates Sharia law and denounces the right of women.

    "text": "0 comments \nWith just days to go until the election, the Democrats are trying to salvage what little remains of Hillary Clinton＊s reputation. Time Magazine is now trying to defend the left-wing candidate with a last resort每using the sexism card. \nAs we get closer to Election Day, the left seems to be running out of excuses for their floundering candidate. Left-wing heads are on the verge of exploding. Not unlike the Galaxy S7. So, in Time Magazine＊s latest attempt to play off Hillary Clinton＊s FBI investigation , they＊re digging deep and pulling out＃ the sexism card ?! \nI am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It＊s us. \nNo it isn＊t. Emailgate, or my preferred term ※Dikileaks§ is about a candidate mishandling confidential email. A flagrant abuse of the law and our national security. Also, Hillary Clinton doesn＊t represent all women. But nice try, dummy. 1 \nThe only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she＊s doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. \nActually yes, we can imagine this happening to a man. Men cannot hide behind their vagina, or Time readers＊ stupidity. Which means they＊re usually punished. See also General Petraeus . Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is running for President. She might even win. While under FBI investigation. So ※muh sexism§ charges are lazy. And insulting to anyone who has three brain cells (like the writer of the Time article). \nThe people are demanding Clinton act like moral exemplars, thundering from the pulpit like Jonathan Edwards or Cotton Mather. But Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh and their many conservative friends are not remotely Clinton＊s moral superiors. They are simply bullies, using gender discrimination to give a veneer of plausibility to their accusations. \n※Moral exemplars§? ※Thundering from the pulpit§? No, Time Magazine feminist shill, Robin Lakoff. People are demanding Hillary Clinton not be a criminal liar. Not really that much to ask of someone who wants to lead the country. \nTrump and the other men on Time Magazine＊s list haven＊t done anything illegal. That＊s the difference, not their sex organs. Not their fashion choices. Evidence is piling up against Hillary more and more each day. Even the mainstream media is turning against her . Which means pantsuits or regular suits enter not into the Hillary is a Criminal equation. Her investigation isn＊t about sexism. It＊s about Hillary breaking the law. \nBut desperate Time calls for predictable, desperate measures: SEXISM! Just as any criticism of Obama was deemed RACISM. \nLeftists are running out of defenses for the pantsuited devil-spawn. So they resort to old hat tactics. Just like they do when they say Wikileaks is the product of Russian hackers. \nIf we had a brick for every Clinton scandal and misdeed, the wall wouldn＊t cost a cent. There＊s nothing sexist about holding someone, male or female, accountable for their actions. In fact, it＊s kind of the opposite. It would be sexist NOT to hold Hillary to the same standards as all the boys. This is absolutely ridiculous. It＊s not that we are against having a woman for president. We＊re just against that woman being Hillary because she is corrupt and a pathological liar. Related Items",

Depending on what is found on the 650,000 emails on Weiner and Abedin＊s laptop, the infamous couple could take down one of the most powerful women on the planet, Hillary Clinton. Something tells me that there is plenty of scandal to go around, however.

The criteria? Contractors needed to be ※FOB＊s,§ or ※Friends of Bill.§ These FOB＊s were donors to the Clinton Foundation. Reportedly, if a contract company was not a donor, they were referred elsewhere, while donating contractors were given funds to work in Haiti. \nAlmost $4 billion was sent to Haiti for relief, and it has been noted by some Haitians that little of this money actually made it to those who need it. \nHaitians also have noted that Bill Clinton was the designated UN Representative for aid to Haiti while Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State. \nThe Clintons were the two most powerful people controlling the funds meant to help Haitians. \nContracts went to friends of the Clintons, and, reportedly, homes were not built, schools were not built, technology was not installed, and infrastructure was not significantly improved. \nHaiti did, however, gain a few million dollar hotels. \nNot exactly what the poor were hoping for. \nTake a look at this video, entitled ※How the Clinton Foundation Got Rich Off Poor Haitians.§ \nThe details are almost too numerous to list.

    "text": "And these people claim that Donald Trump is a racist! There goes Hillary＊s black vote! Whenever the term ※Nazi§ is used to describe a minority group, you know things are bad. Democrat donor and Hillary Clinton supporter Benjamin Barber was caught on hidden camera voicing his opinion on blacks who may vote Republican. The disturbing comments were recorded at a fundraiser for United States Senate Candidate Deborah Ross, of North Carolina. Barber said, ※Have you hear of the Sonderkommandos? Jewish guards who helped murder Jews in the camps. So there were even Jews that were helping the Nazis murder Jews! So black who are helping the other side are seriously f*cked in the head. They＊re only helping the enemy who will destroy them. Maybe they think ＆if I help them we＊ll get along okay; somehow I＊ll save my race by working with the murderers.§ Barber was caught in this disgusting tirade on the Upper West Side of New York City after the fundraiser in September. Watch for yourself: \nBesides being disturbing, these comments have racist undertones that are more far-reaching than they even seem at first. It is as if blacks do not have the ability to work and create a good life for themselves, so they are somehow obligated to support liberals and Democrats. \nLyndon Johnson started pandering to the black vote decades ago, and ever since, the black community has suffered. Fatherless homes, unemployment, drugs, and crime problems have plagued black communities. These communities also contain good people, people who deserve better. \nAll that having been said, comparing Black Republicans to Jews who killed other Jews while in Nazi captivity is just bizarre. It appears that this man is sincere when he speaks, as well! \nWill this video make a difference in an already out of control Election? \nThe hits just keep on rolling. Related Items",

Aside from her tardiness, a number of other bizarre observations are causing people to ask questions: She is finally on stage. Voice raspy. 8:15. That alone suggests serious issues with her campaign. 1 hour 45 minutes late. #HillaryInAZ \na?? Audit The Media ???????? (@AuditTheMedia) November 3, 2016 \nRaspy voice?

(@Cernovich) August 7, 2016 \nOther reports says that she was yelling in a bizarre manner, but we are used to that. \nPerhaps most telling is her pre-speech behavior. \nShe is clearly pacing and viewers are noticing a nervous smile, as if she cannot sit still and is trying to convince herself that everything is ok. If you watch closely, you will see her speaking, presumably to the people around her, then swatting one hand in the air in a strange way. \nIt looks as if she is using all of her self-control just to keep it together. \nWatch and decide for yourself. Make sure to study her facial expressions and the swatting of her arm. \nIt is easy to understand why she is stressed. The long, controversial Presidential Campaign of 2016 is winding down, the FBI is mounting multiple investigations of her and her family, and her best friend and top assistant, Huma Abedin, is likely spilling the beans on everything she knows. It is likely that Abedin and her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, are cutting some sort of deal with authorities. \nAll the while, the FBI is digging through 650,000 emails. \nStressful indeed.",

    "title": "BAD DAY For Hillary! New Report Proves DOJ Blocked FBI Investigation Into Clinton Foundation!",
    "text": "0 comments \nAll the suspense is building up with Hillary and the FBI, as the election is literally right around the corner. What will happen to her? Who knows since the Justice Department is blocking the investigation . Obviously there＊s something fishy! \nGood morning Hillary Clinton! We already hit you today with FBI: Clinton Foundation Case ＆Likely＊ Moving Toward an Indictment. What else could possibly go wrong? How about everything? \nLike audio recordings of the FBI wanting to investigate the Clinton Foundation, but the DOJ getting in the way? Yes, the same DOJ headed up by Loretta Lynch (see Nothing to Hide? AG Loretta Lynch ＆Pleads Fifth＊ On Iran Ransom Investigation)＃ \nThe FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case. The suspect was talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn＊t tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate. But it was, they thought, worth checking out. Prosecutors thought the talk was hearsay and a weak basis to warrant aggressive tactics, like presenting evidence to a grand jury, because the person who was secretly recorded wasn＊t inside the Clinton Foundation. FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors. Some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. \nLet me break this down for you real simple for any errant leftist who found this site while searching for Gender Queer styling tips. As a general rule, people who join the FBI respect the law. Some may even love the law. These FBI agents go through intense study and training with dreams of taking down baddies. Sometimes with a gun, sometimes with a pen. FBI agents, as a general rule, are in the FBI so they can be good guys. Okay? Okay. \nSo when agents discovered Hillary Clinton, a politician sitting at the tippity-top of our government, was possibly engaging in criminality, which may have endangered the security of the United States, these FBI agents wanted to pursue. Good guys vs. Bad Lady with Cankles. \nBUT, the higher-ups (like Loretta Lynch) at the Justice Department, essentially told the FBI agents to look the other way. Hillary was being protected (or so it appears) so she could run for and become president. The first lady president. Priorities. \nKind of runs counter to everything these FBI agents stand for, yes? It appears they were unwilling to stand down and ignore justice. This isn＊t so much of a surprise to us: read also CORRUPTION: FBI, DOJ Wanted to Investigate Hillary. Comey and Lynch Intervened. \nWith five days to go, who knew Hillary＊s closing argument would be ※But I don＊t think I＊m getting arrested?§ \nI hope Hillary is feeling very scared right about now. Does she think she can just get away with all of her lies?! Apparently the entire democratic party thinks the same. These people are despicable. America, do yourself a favor and KEEP HER OUT OF OFFICE. Related Items",

    "text": "Share on Twitter \nYou've all heard by now that Donald Trump thinks Hillary Clinton is trying to rig the campaign, including the idea that she's trying to suppress his voters. \nNow Bloomberg Businessweek has a major new story out on his campaign, including a few fascinating revelations: \n※Nate Silver＊s results have been similar to ours....except they lag by a week or two because he＊s relying on public polls.§ \nThe campaign holds rallies in non-traditional states like New Hampshire and Maine because data shows that's where the most persuadable voters can be found. \nYou meet Brad Parscale, Trump's main digital guy, who has quite a background.

It concentrates on three key groups. 1) White Liberals \nTrump＊s invocation at the debate of Clinton＊s WikiLeaks e-mails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. 2) Young Women \nThe parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. 3) African-Americans \nHer 1996 suggestion that some African American males are ※super predators§ is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls〞particularly in Florida. \nThat strategy in action: \nOn Oct. 24, Trump＊s team began placing spots on select African American radio stations. In San Antonio, a young staffer showed off a South Park-style animation he＊d created of Clinton delivering the ※super predator§ line (using audio from her original 1996 sound bite), as cartoon text popped up around her: ※Hillary Thinks African Americans are Super Predators.§ \nThe animation will be delivered to certain African American voters through Facebook ※dark posts§〞nonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that, as Parscale puts it, ※only the people we want to see it, see it.§ The aim is to depress Clinton＊s vote total. ※We know because we＊ve modeled this,§ says the official. ※It will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out.§ \nEarly voting shows that the efforts to decrease turnout may not be working according to the Trump campaign's plan, but it's rare for a campaign to so openly boast of an effort to get people not to vote.",

    "text": "Getty - Justin Sullivan The Wildfire is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. \nEarlier this week, Americans learned that Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's Super PAC, Common Good VA, donated $500K to Jill McCabe's senate run. \nJill just so happens to be the wife of Andrew McCabe 〞 the current Deputy Director of the FBI 〞 who oversaw the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. \nIf that wasn't enough to give you trust issues, it turns out that Hillary Clinton herself headlined a fundraiser for Common Good VA. The event took place in June of 2015, just one month before the FBI officially launched its investigation into Clinton's email server. \nAccording to The Daily Mail , the fundraiser that Clinton helped spearhead raised over a million dollars. \nClinton returned to Common Good in October of 2015 for another speech. That speech conveniently took place just one week before Jill McCabe received two donations, one on October 25th in the sum of $175,000 and the other on October 27th for $125,000. \nIn addition, one of Common Good's biggest donors, James Bernard , gave the PAC $100,000 just three days before McCabe got her October donations. \nThere's more. \nBernard is a big Hillary supporter, too. In fact, he's listed on her site as a ※Hillblazer,§ someone recognized for raising or contributing $100K or more to the campaign. \nYet, he's the not the only Hillblazer who donated to Common Good before McCabe was given her biggest campaign contribution. \nIndependent Journal Review discovered that Louisa Cohlan also donated $100k to Common Good. Her $100k donation took place on Sept 30th of 2015, which was one day before McCabe received a $150,000 from the PAC. \nCohlan has an interesting tie to the Clintons. In 2014 , Louisa and her husband Johnathan purchased a 4.1 million dollar vacation home that the Clinton family used while Bill was still president. 'Auction planned for home where Clinton family stayed during Skaneateles vacations' http://t.co/dsPxh4qkws #PLANY pic.twitter.com/8tkSMPVl9w \nOther donors who contributed $100K to the PAC include: \nSamuel Nappi, who is also a major Clinton Campaign donor and supporter. \nThe late Mark Weiner , a good friend of Bill Clinton and major fundraiser for the Democrat Party. \nAnd Robert L. Johnson, America's first African American billionaire who also donated $100K to the Clinton Campaign \nHowever, the deep ties Hillary's campaign has to Common Good go even deeper than that. \nThe Daily Mail's investigation revealed the ties Clinton's staff have to the PAC: \nZuzenak, who oversaw the donations to Jill McCabe, left Common Good VA last May to join the Clinton campaign as its Virginia field director. \nHe isn't alone in the move. Common Good VA's executive director Michael Halle also joined the Clinton campaign as battleground analytics director in the spring of 2015. \nThe group's former fundraiser, Amanda McTyre, is now a finance director for Clinton, and staffer Marissa Astor left to become an assistant Clinton campaign manager. \nAnd the cake-topper, Clinton's current campaign manager, Robby Mook, also worked for the PAC prior to the campaign role he has now. \nOne thing is for certain: Such revelations will raise new questions about possible foul play and major conflict-of-interest surrounding Hillary's candidacy. Because with it all staring you in the face, everything seems all too convenient to just be a mere coincidence.",

    "text": "Getty - Andrew Theodorakis \nAs more and more internal emails and documents show up through Wikileaks and other sources, America has seen the curtain pulled back dramatically on the current state of politics. \nIn one of the most recent emails that the Daily Caller obtained through Citizens United, the receding curtain shed more light on Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. \nThe email exchange, dated December 4, 2012, began with a request from Paul McElearney 〞 head of member development at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) 〞 to Huma Abedin. He wanted to meet face-to-face with Clinton during his trip to Ireland a few days later. \nIn addition, McElearney asked Abedin if Clinton would meet with four others 〞 two of whom were CGI sponsors. Abedin forwarded his request to Bill Clinton aides Doug Band, Jon Davidson, and Justin Cooper, and asked if they had ties to CGI: Image Credit: State Dept/Citizens United via The Daily Caller \nAbedin asked Clinton's aides: \n※Are these legit CGI people? I know Denis O'Brian but not the others. Everyone is asking to see her.§ \nDavidson responded by confirming that two of the names on the list 〞 O'Brian and Michael Carey 〞 were connected to CGI, but that the other two names on the list were not. \nAnother email obtained by Citizens United showed Bill Clinton aide Doug Band asking Abedin to invite an executive from the Dow Chemicals Japanese office (to whom both Band and Clinton were connected financially) to a State Department meeting between Hillary Clinton and the Japanese Prime Minister: Image Credit: State Department/Citizens United via The Daily Caller \nThis is not the first time that Abedin has been implicated in Clinton's alleged efforts to leverage her position in the State Department to the financial advantage of CGI. \nJudicial Watch obtained a series of emails between Clinton aides Doug Band and Huma Abedin that detailed a number of times when people who donated or were connected to CGI were granted special or expedited access to Clinton while she served in the State Department. \nAmong the most notable exchanges involved Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain, who had attempted access through normal channels and was denied. But Judicial Watch reported that everything changed once a donation was made: \n\"Included among the Abedin-Band emails is an exchange revealing that when Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain requested a meeting with Secretary of State Clinton, he was forced to go through the Clinton Foundation for an appointment. \nAbedin advised Band that when she went through 'normal channels' at State, Clinton declined to meet. After Band intervened, however, the meeting was set up within forty-eight hours. \nAccording to the Clinton Foundation website, in 2005, Salman committed to establishing the Crown Prince＊s International Scholarship Program (CPISP) for the Clinton Global Initiative. And by 2010, it had contributed $32 million to CGI. \nThe Kingdom of Bahrain reportedly gave between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. And Bahrain Petroleum also gave an additional $25,000 to $50,000.\" \nAbedin also revealed, in an email obtained by Wikileaks , a direct ※pay-for-play§ exchange involving CGI and the king of Morocco 〞 just weeks after Clinton had announced her run for the presidency. Fox News reported on the link: \n※Abedin wrote that 'this was HRC's idea' for her to speak at a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in Morocco in May 2015 as an explicit condition for the $12 million commitment from the king.§ \nClinton campaign manager Robby Mook stalled and attempted to redirect when he was asked about this exchange in a recent interview with Fox News's Chris Wallace.",

    "text": "Getty - Josh Edelson \nThe Yale Record, America＊s ※oldest college humor magazine,§ taunted the IRS on Thursday by essentially endorsing Hillary Clinton for president by ※not§ endorsing her. \nThe magazine is a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, meaning they are prohibited from engaging in political activities. \nThe Yale Record is walking a tightrope as it relates to their non-profit status. Read the editorial board's post below: \nIn its 144-year history, The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. In fact, we have never endorsed any candidate for president. This is, in part, due to our strong commitment to being a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, which mandates that we are ※absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.§ \nThis year＊s presidential election is highly unusual, but ultimately no different: The Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally un-endorsable, due to our faithful compliance with the tax code. \nIn particular, we do not endorse Hillary Clinton＊s exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye. We do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this country〞a commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career. Because of unambiguous tax law, we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern American history, nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8. \nThe Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr. Jill Stein. \n〞The Editorial Board of The Yale Record \nAny reasonable reader would infer that the editorial board is indeed supporting Clinton for president. The only question is whether the paper gave itself enough legal wiggle room before publishing what might as well be a full-throated endorsement. Image Credit: Jemal Countess/Getty Images \nHere's what the IRS has to say on the matter: \n※...tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code are prohibited from participating or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate for public office. Charities, educational institutions and religious organizations, including churches, are among those that are covered under this code section.\" \n[...] \n※These organizations cannot endorse any candidates, make donations to their campaigns, engage in fund raising, distribute statements, or become involved in any other activities that may be beneficial or detrimental to any particular candidate. Even activities that encourage people to vote for or against a particular candidate on the basis of nonpartisan criteria violate the political campaign prohibition of section 501(c)(3).\" \nThe Yale Daily News faced similar controversy when it openly endorsed Clinton. The paper wouldn't confirm its non-profit status to The Daily Caller and called the matter a ※misunderstanding.§",

There's been no systematic investigation of various issues. \nI know this generation of Republican leaders is loath to exercise these tools, but impeachment is something that's relevant. \nThey see [the oversight process] as an opportunity in some measure to keep their opponents off-kilter, but they don't want to do the substantive and principled work to truly hold corrupt politicians, or the administration, or anyone accountable.\" \nSince the FBI recommended no indictment for Hillary Clinton, the call to reopen the case into her email server has been shut down by the Bureau. \nOn the other hand, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump isn't satisfied with the outcome. He even wants to go as far to investigate the FBI's investigation if he takes the White House. \nMeanwhile, Judicial Watch has launched an investigation into Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe , whose political organization donated about $500,000 to the campaign coffers of Dr. Jill McCabe, the wife of an FBI figurehead who helped provide oversight over the investigation into Clinton's private server.",

    "text": "Getty - Chip Somodevilla The Wildfire is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. \nHillary Clinton advisers Cheryl Mills and Robbie Mook provide one of the most revealing looks inside the campaign yet, courtesy of a WikiLeaks hacked email. \nIn the email , Robbie Mooks argues that Hillary Clinton would be making a mistake to run on her gender as an argument for her suitability to be president: \n\"In fact, I think running on her gender would be the SAME mistake as 2008, ie having a message at odds with what voters ultimately want. She ran on experience when voters wanted change...and sure there was plenty of data in marks polls with voters saying her experience appealed to them. But that was missing the larger point〞voters wanted change. \nSame deal here〞lots of people are going to say it would be neat for a woman to be president but that doesn't mean that's actually WHY they will vote for her. That's likely to be how she will handle the economy and relate to the middle class. \nIt's also risky because injecting gender makes her candidacy about HER and not the voters and making their lives better. \nThat said I would not be surprised if this is a powerful message for donor and activist engagement (vs persuadable voters).\" Image Credit: Michael Buckner/Getty Images \nThen, Mills responds: \nInteresting how hard this narrative is being pushed. \nA friend shared this article with you from The Washington Post: \nEmbrace being a woman running for president.. \nhttp://wapo.st/1dbwtNo \nThe link is to a Chris Cillizza article on ※How Hillary Clinton can correct the biggest mistake she made in 2008.§ \nBut one of the most fascinating tidbits is Mooks' suggestive off-hand reference to getting a ※third party spoiler§: \n\"Just need a third party spoiler and we'll be all set! \nI think the chatterers will dissect and criticize whatever she chooses to do but it's going to be so important that the research drive it. I often felt in 08 that the research was being used to back up a premise instead of genuinely find the right target.\" \nTo which Mills replied cryptically: \n※WJC redux of 1992§ \nWJC is a common acronym for former President William Jefferson Clinton. The reference is to the three-man race in 1992 between George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. Contrary to what is widely believed, there is fairly convincing evidence that Perot did not ※cost§ Bush the 1992 election. \nTrump supporters have mused if presidential candidates Gary Johnson and independent Evan McMullin are in the 2016 race for the sole purpose of sabotaging the Republican presidential nominee. Image Credit: George Frey/Getty Images \nJohnson, who is running at about six percent in the polls, is running on the Libertarian Party ticket. For historical context, the Libertarians have sent up a presidential candidate every year for the last 44 years . Libertarians have plenty to disagree about regarding Trump's plan for the United States, whether it be on national security, immigration or trade. \nThat leads us to Evan McMullin, a man whose name recently caught fire on Twitter due to the so-called ※ Mormon mafia § started by Mitt Romney. Lou Dobbs, an ardent Trump advocate, coined the phrase while labeling McMullin... 〞 Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) October 23, 2016 \nMcMullin was indeed a Mormon missionary, but reports of him belonging to a ※mafia§ remain unconfirmed. The candidate was a CIA operative and an investment banker at Goldman Sachs, which has fueled speculation and conspiracy theories about his run. \nInterestingly, the candidate is currently surging in Utah and his support may be underestimated . If McMullin could pull off a victory, it would launch an improbable scenario that could see the election thrown to the House of Representatives and an all-out scramble to nominate a president and vice president of the Congress's choosing. \nThis potential monkey wrench in Trump's plans has fueled outrage and concern among supporters: Team Hillary is all set: Ex-CIA Evan McMullin is the expert covert spoiler.

No, this isn't a set-up to an Airplane! punchline, this appears to be life under an imminent Hillary Clinton regime. \nIt turns out that Secretary of State is not really all about being the nation's chief diplomat and top foreign policy aide to the president, but is rather a cozy career path for Democratic politicians who want to pad their resumes. Who knew? \nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was an indisputable disaster. Leaving aside the clear violations with her private email server, which transmitted classified information , was potentially hacked , and put the nation's security at risk for Clinton's ※ convenience § here are a few more of her lowlights: \nCompletely misjudging the Arab Spring ※democratic§ movement \nGravely miscalculating with her ※reset§ policy and encouraging Russian aggression \nAssessing Bashar al-Assad as a ※ reformer ,§ overseeing a disastrous Syrian policy \nFailing to support the Iranian people during their freedom demonstration \nPushing to remove Gaddafi by force in Libya, only to leave it a failed state \nOverseeing a Middle Eastern policy that culminated in the rise of ISIS \nFailing to secure the Benghazi, Libya annex that was overrun by terrorists, leading to the death of four American servicement, then lying by blaming a Youtube video Image Credit: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images \nIt goes on and on. But it gets worse. The reigns at the State Department were turned over to Senator John Kerry, whose testimony on the Vietnam war is notorious on the right. Kerry's tenure has been nothing short of feckless and laughable. No, seriously. \nVladimir Putin, for example, is actually laughing at Kerry's useless protestations against Russia's backing of Assad. Kerry was also a vocal supporter of the Iranian nuclear deal, and he is satisfied that the deal will keep the mullahs on good behavior, despite their venomous hatred of the United States and lengthy track record of lying. \nThe icing on the cake for this stretch of Democratic career politicians taking over the helm at State will culminate with Hillary Clinton's whispered preference for the job with current Vice President Joe Biden. Image Credit: Mark Wilson/Getty Images \nAs reported by The Washington Examiner: \nVice President Joe Biden is at the top of the list for secretary of state if Hillary Clinton pulls out a win on Nov. 8. \nA source close to Clinton's transition team told Politico on Thursday evening that the Democratic nominee is already making serious considerations when it comes to who would be part of a Clinton 2.0 Cabinet. \nThe hilarious part? Biden himself seems to be oblivious to the potential nod. \nBiden himself is apparently unfamiliar with the news. Neither Clinton, a former secretary of state herself, nor her aides, have informed the former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman that he's most likely to oversee international affairs if she wins. \n※He'd be great, and they are spending a lot of time figuring out the best way to try to persuade him to do it if she wins,§ said the source familiar with the transition planning. \nThough many are in disbelief about the report, there is one very plausible reason to believe that Biden very well could spend his sunset years at the State Department: And that's the reward for not running. https://t.co/10DepJ4x9B 〞 Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) October 28, 2016 \nThat's just the way that Democrats roll, nowadays.",

    "text": "2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election\nUnearthed tape: 'We should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win'\nBy Ken Kurson\n \" Observer \" - On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.\nThe tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.\nThe tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton?s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is ?rigged.?\nSpeaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).\n?I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,? said Sen. Clinton. ?And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.?\nChomsky recalls being taken aback that ?anyone could support the idea?offered by a national political leader, no less?that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.?\nSome eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency.\nRegarding capturing combatants in war?the June capture of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants who came across the Gaza border via an underground tunnel was very much front of mind?Clinton can be heard on the tape saying, ?And then, when, you know, Hamas, you know, sent the terrorists, you know, through the tunnel into Israel that killed and captured, you know, kidnapped the young Israeli soldier, you know, there?s a sense of like, one-upsmanship, and in these cultures of, you know, well, if they captured a soldier, we?ve got to capture a soldier.?\nEquating Hamas, which to this day remains on the State Department?s official list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, with the armed forces of a close American ally was not what many expected to hear in the Jewish Press editorial offices, which were then at Third Avenue and Third Street in Brooklyn. (The paper?s office has since moved to the Boro Park section of Brooklyn.) The use of the phrase ?these cultures? is also a bit of a head-scratcher.\nAccording to Chomsky, Clinton was ?gracious, personable and pleasant throughout? the interview, taking about an hour to speak to, in addition to himself, managing editor Jerry Greenwald, assistant to the publisher Naomi Klass Mauer, counsel Dennis Rapps and senior editor Jason Maoz.\nAnother part of the tape highlights something that was relatively uncontroversial at the time but has taken on new meaning in light of the current campaign?speaking to leaders with whom our country is not on the best terms. Clinton has presented a very tough front in discussing Russia, for example, accusing Trump of unseemly ardor for strongman Vladimir Putin and mocking his oft-stated prediction that as president he?d ?get along? with Putin.\nChomsky is heard on the tape asking Clinton what now seems like a prescient question about Syria, given the disaster unfolding there and its looming threat to drag the U.S., Iran and Russia into confrontation.\n?Do you think it?s worth talking to Syria?both from the U.S. point [of view] and Israel?s point [of view]??\nClinton replied, ?You know, I?m pretty much of the mind that I don?t see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as you?re not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them,? an answer that reflects her mastery of the facts but also reflects a willingness to talk to Russia that sounds more like Trump 2016 than Clinton 2016.\nShortly after, she said, ?But if you say, ?they?re evil, we?re good, [and] we?re never dealing with them,? I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them So I would like to talk to you [the enemy] because I want to know more about you. Because if I want to defeat you, I?ve got to know something more about you. I need different tools to use in my campaign against you. That?s my take on it.?\nA final bit of interest to the current campaign involves an articulation of phrases that Trump has accused Clinton of being reluctant to use. Discussing the need for a response to terrorism, Clinton said, ?I think you can make the case that whether you call it ?Islamic terrorism? or ?Islamo-fascism,? whatever the label is we?re going to give to this phenomenon, it?s a threat. It?s a global threat. To Europe, to Israel, to the United States Therefore we need a global response. It?s a global threat and it needs a global response. That can be the, sort of, statement of principle So I think sometimes having the global vision is a help as long as you realize that underneath that global vision there?s a lot of variety and differentiation that has to go on.?\nIt?s not clear what she means by a global vision with variety and differentiation, but what?s quite clear is that the then-senator, just five years after her state was the epicenter of the September 11 attacks, was comfortable deploying the phrase ?Islamic terrorism? and the even more strident ?Islamo-fascism,? at least when meeting with the editorial board of a Jewish newspaper.\nIn an interview before the Observer heard the tape, Chomsky told the Observer that Clinton made some ?odd and controversial comments? on the tape. The irony of a decade-old recording emerging to feature a candidate making comments that are suddenly relevant to voters today was not lost on Chomsky, who wrote the original story at the time. Oddly enough, that story, headlined ?Hillary Clinton on Israel, Iraq and Terror,? is no longer available on jewishpress.com and even a short summary published on the Free Republic offers a broken link that can no longer surface the story.\n?I went to my bosses at the time,? Chomsky told the Observer. ?The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody?even a direct Quote: from anyone?in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn?t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.?\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, publisher of Observer Media.",

    "text": "Why Hillary Won't Unleash WWIII By Pepe Escobar October 31, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" RT \" - She is fully supported by virtually the whole US establishment; a bipartisan, neocon/neoliberalcon, regime change/?humanitarian? imperialist axis.\nOn the opposite side, for all his personal pathology problems and incoherent twitter-mouth ramblings, Donald Trump seemed to be on the money when he said that if elected, Hillary would use Syria to unleash WWIII.\nTo check out if that holds, let?s start with an essential backup.\nThe ?Queen of War?, at the final US presidential debate in Las Vegas: \" A no-fly zone [in Syria] can save lives and hasten the end of the conflict. \"\nThe ?Queen of War?, in one of her 2013 speeches to Goldman Sachs, published by WikiLeaks: a no-fly zone would \" kill a lot of Syrians .?\nThe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, speaking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: a no-fly zone in Syria ? would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia. \"\nNo-fly zone would ?require war with #Syria and #Russia ? ? top US general https://t.co/veSy8uETak pic.twitter.com/zXyCmWjdXj\n? RT America (@RT_America) September 22, 2016 Predictably, the Clinton (cash) machine has been relentless promoting Hillary?s no-fly zone. Whenever cornered, the machine switches the narrative to Russian hacking of the DNC. Edward Snowden, who knows a thing or two about cyberwarfare, stresses there is no solid proof Russian intel hacked the Democratic/Clinton machine. And if they actually did it, the NSA would know. The fact the NSA is mum reveals this is no more than information war.\nPass the missile launchers, please Trump seems to have been more on the money when he insisted how Hillary will be outsmarted ? as she already was in the past ? when dealing with President Putin, who she has demonized as Hitler.\nI have shown how Hillary will be prevented from launching WWIII because her no-fly zone is already implemented in Syria by Russia. And the Pentagon ? reflecting Dunford?s comments - knows it, no matter how emphatically soon-to-be-unemployed Pentagon head Ash Carter threatens ? consequences .?\nThe Pentagon ranks Russia and China as the number one and two ?existential threats? to US national security, in that order. And the US government reserves for itself the privilege of a nuclear ?first-strike? ? which Hillary supports (but not Trump); this is part of the 2002 Full Spectrum Dominance doctrine.\nThe relentless hysteria now crystallized as Cold War 2.0 has led scores of analysts to game the actual ? terrifying - possibility of a US-Russia hot war. As much as the Cold War MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) doctrine may now lie in the dust ? exactly because Washington refuses to back down from ?first-strike? ? only armchair Dr. Strangeloves get their kicks with the possibility of fighting a nuclear power. Dunford does not seem to be one of them.\nWhat Hillary Clinton will certainly do is to double down on proxy wars, Vietnam/Afghanistan-style. So expect a President Clinton to authorize full weaponization of those Beltway-loved ?moderate? Al-Qaeda-in-Syria rebels with plenty of shoulder-held missile launchers. This could easily get out of control ? with lethal, yet not nuclear, consequences.\nThat?s exactly the point made by Mikhail Rostovsky in Moscow daily Moskovsky Komsomolets; if Hillary ratchets up tensions, ? things could get out of hand .?\nAlso expect not so proxy ratcheting up of tension in the South China Sea; after all it was Hillary who claimed ?mothership? of the pivot to Asia; and it was Hillary who steered intra-South East Asian maritime disputes into the boiling cauldron of wider US-China competition.\nAnd if that was not hard boiled enough, US frustration will be at an all-time high after Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte?s own pivot to China.\nSay hello to my new Sarmat A case can be made that official Moscow is carefully getting ready to work with a Clinton ? as in Obama III ? presidency, with Hillary, a devil they know well when she was Secretary of State, to be dealt with as a pragmatist, unwilling and unable to plunge US-Russia relations into total incandescence.\nA Clinton presidency for its part should know better than overestimate Russia?s financial ? weakness. ?\nThe national debt of Russia is only 17.7 percent of GDP; for the US it is a whopping 104.17 percent of GDP, or $19.2 trillion. Russia in 2015 had a trade surplus of $150 billion, while the US had a trade deficit of $531.5 billion. The current account surplus of Russia was 5.1 percent of GDP, or 65.8 billion, while the US ran a current account deficit of 484.1 billion, or 2.7 percent of GDP.\nBesides, Russia has all the natural resources it needs; unlike the US government, which believes it needs an empire of bases overseas and ten aircraft carrier task forces to secure the resources it lacks.\nMoreover, as much as the Pentagon may continue to be infested by neocon cells, sound generals are also able to identify key Russian signals ? such as the unveiling of the RS-28 Sarmat nuclear missile, which NATO calls Satan 2. The Sarmat delivers monster warheads of 40 megatons; boasts a top speed of seven kilometers per second; and is able to outfox any anti-missile shield system anywhere.\nFirst images of new thermonuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile to replace 'Satan' unveilled in Russia https://t.co/mmX2EHALQu\n?

    "text": "Hillary Clinton, FBI and the Real November Surprise\nBy Pepe Escobar \"As bad as it is the folks above the President make the decisions. They may have decided on Trump. These things do not happen by accident.\" \" Sputnik \" - Thus spoke a high-level US business mover and shaker with secure transit in rarified Masters of the Universe-related circles, amidst the utter political chaos provoked by head of the FBI James Comey?s latest bombshell.\nIt?s virtually established by now that US Attorney General Loretta Lynch told Comey not to release his letter to Congress. But Comey did it anyway. If he had not, and a scandal would ? inevitably ? spring up after the US presidential election, Lynch would be perfectly positioned to deny she knew anything, and Comey would be on the firing line.\nLynch is a certified Clinton machine asset. In 1999 then-President Bill Clinton appointed her to run the Brooklyn US Attorney?s office. She left in 2002, taking the private practice revolving door. She was back to the Brooklyn office in 2010, urged by Obama. Five years later she became the 83rd US Attorney General, replacing the dodgy Eric Holder.\nA plausible case has been made that Comey took his fateful decision based on a serious internal revolt at the FBI ? led by key people he trust ? as well as being egged-on by his wife.\nYet one of the key questions that refuse to go away is why the FBI waited until 11 days before the US presidential election to supposedly \"find\" an email trove on certified sexting pervert Anthony Weiner?s laptop.\nA Deal With Donald?\nThe business source, although unsympathetic to the Clinton machine, especially in foreign policy, is a realpolitik practitioner, not a conspiracy theorist. He is adamant that, ?the FBI reversal could not have happened without orders above the President. If the Masters [of the Universe] have changed their mind, then they will destroy Hillary.?\nHe adds, ?they can make a deal with Donald just like anyone else; Donald wins; the Masters win; the people think that their voice has been heard. And then there will be some sort of (controlled) change.?\nWhat?s paramount in the whole soap opera is the faith in the US political system ? as corrupt as it may be ? must endure. That mirrors the faith in the US dollar; if confidence in the US dollar fails, the US as a hegemonic financial power is no more.\nThe source is equally adamant that, ?it is almost unprecedented to see a cover-up as extensive as Hillary?s. A secret meeting between Bill Clinton and the Attorney General; the FBI ignoring all evidence and initially clearing Hillary to near rebellion of the whole of the FBI, attested to by Rudolf Giuliani whose reputation as a federal prosecutor is unquestioned; the Clinton ?pay for play? foundation. The Masters are troubled that this is getting out of hand.?\nThe record shows that ?the Masters do not usually have to go to such lengths to protect their own. They did manage to save Bill Clinton from the Monica Lewinsky perjury and keep him in the presidency. The Masters were not attacked in this case. They even got away with the 1987 cash settlement crash and the theft surrounding the Lehman debacle. In all these cases there were no overarching challenges to their control, as we see now open to the public by Trump. They antagonized and insulted the wrong man.?\nAll Aboard the Huma Train\nHillary Clinton is not at the center of Comey?s jaw-dropping October Surprise; it?s actually her right-hand woman and ersatz ?daughter? Huma Abedin. This early January essay on Huma Abedin contains plenty of nuggets out and about ? some of them positively eyebrow raising.\nIn case Hillary Clinton becomes the next President of the United States (POTUS), Abedin, alternatively known as Princess of Saudi Arabia, will most likely become Hillary?s chief of staff ? the power behind running all White House operations.\nA glimpse of the FBI-Huma Abedin connection is available here . Abedin was granted Top Secret security clearance for the first time in 2009, when Hillary named her deputy chief of staff for operations. Abedin later said she ?did not remember? being read into any Special Access Programs (SAPs).\nIt?s crucial to remember that one of Abedin?s emails was huma@clintonemail.com. Crucial translation: she was the only high-level State Dept. aide whose emails were hosted by the notorious Subterranean Clinton Email Server ? which she claimed she didn?t know existed until she heard about it in the news.\nAbedin swore under oath in a lawsuit brought against the State Dept. by Judicial Watch that she had handed over all of her laptops and smart phones that could host emails relevant to the Subterranean Email Server investigation.\nThat may not have been the case. The laptop at the center of Comey?s bombshell was shared by Abedin and her husband Wiener before they split. If Abedin lied, she could face up to five years in jail for perjury. As if the whole illegal email-cum-sexting saga was not sordid enough, the ?climax? now seems to have turned into a mixed wrestling match between the former couple, with the big ?prize? being the slammer.\nThe FBI has finally obtained a warrant and is now frantically searching no less than 650,000 Abedin emails found on sexting freak Wiener?s laptop; the objective is to exactly determine which ones came from the Subterranean Email Server.\nAs if this was not demeaning enough, the FBI continues to conduct an investigation on the Clinton Foundation. As former Assistant Director of the FBI Tom Fuentes said , ?The FBI has an intensive investigation ongoing into the Clinton Foundation the investigation would go forward as a comprehensive unified case and be coordinated, so that investigation is ongoing and Huma Abedin and her role and activities concerning Secretary of State in the nature of the foundation and possible ?pay to play?, that?s still being looked at now.?\nWhatever happens until election day, US voters will have to consider the startling fact they may choose a next POTUS that is the subject of a wide-ranging ?comprehensive unified? FBI investigation.\nA Rotten, Rigged System?\nA former federal public corruption prosecutor volunteers a plausible take on Comey?s action. In a nutshell, FBI agents investigating Weiner?s sexting ? and they are a different set of agents investigating Emailgate ? saw evidence of State Dept emails on his laptop. Comey knew he needed a search warrant to comb the emails at Wiener?s computer. So he pre-empted the ? inevitable ? subsequent hype by ?sending out a vague letter to the Hill? that in the end left everyone even more confused.\nThat interpretation though may be only scratching the surface. Deeper and deeper, it seems that Comey?s decision was really precipitated by the senior FBI agents? insurgence ? fed up with the ?extreme carelessness? Hillary cover-up. They?ve got to have some surefire material on the Clinton (cash) machine that never saw the light.\nComey could have just waited to say something after the election; after all the FBI maintains they had checked all Clinton emails, including deleted ones, not to mention the Podesta emails. So the emails on sexting Wiener?s laptop may be no more than a limited hangout.\nA much more plausible explanation is that Comey had to do it not only because of the FBI internal revolt (or because he had an urge to upstage WikiLeaks?) He had to do it because the rot goes way beyond the Clinton ?pay to play? racket and involves virtually the whole system, from the deep recesses of the Obama administration to the War Party scam, the Department of Justice, the CIA and the FBI itself.\nWhat next? Brace for impact; it may well be the ultimate November Surprise.",

    "text": "What Does it Take to Bring Hillary Clinton to Justice?\nBy Pepe Escobar\n RT \" - Virtually the whole planet holds its collective breath at the prospect of Hillary Clinton possibly becoming the next President of the United States (POTUS).\nHow?s that humanly possible, as the (daily) Bonfire of The Scandals ? relentlessly fed by WikiLeaks revelations and now converging FBI investigations - can now be seen from interstellar space? It?s possible because Hillary Clinton, slouching through a paroxysm of manufactured hysteria, is supported by virtually the whole US establishment, a consensual neocon/neoliberalcon War Party/Wall Street/corporate media axis.\nBut History has a tendency to show us there?s always a straw that breaks the camel?s back.\nThis could be it ? as revealed by WikiLeaks ; March 2, 2015, the day when John Podesta wrote, ?we are going to have to dump all those emails.?\nThat happened to be the exact same day it was revealed Hillary Clinton had used a personal email server as Secretary of State.\nYet this reveals only part of the puzzle. There?s got to be a response to Podesta?s email ? which WikiLeaks may, or may not, leak in the next few days before the election. If the back and forth clearly shows intent (to mislead), then we?ve got a 100 percent smoking gun: the whole Clinton (cash) machine narrative ? according to which Hillary just deleted \"personal\" emails ? crumbles like the ultimate House of Cards.\nMoreover, that would unveil what was from the start the privileged Clinton machine strategy: to thwart the subsequent internal State Dept. and FBI investigations.\nAs far as the Clinton machine is concerned, an interlocking influence peddling pile up is the norm. John Podesta also happens to be the founder of the Center for American Progress ? a George Soros operation and prime recruiting ground for Obama administration officials, including US Treasury operatives who decided which elite Too Big To Fail (TBTF) financial giants would be spared after the 2008 crisis. DCLeaks.com , for its part, has connected Soros Open Society foundations to global funding rackets directly leading to subversion of governments and outright regime change (obviously sparing Clinton Foundation donors.)\nExceptional bananas, anyone? The perfectly timed slow drip of WikiLeaks revelations, for the Clinton machine, feels like a sophisticated form of Chinese torture. To alleviate the pain, the relentless standard spin has been to change the subject, blame the messenger, and attribute it all to ?evil? Russian hacking when the real source for the leaks might have come straight from the belly of the (Washington) beast.\nAt the Valdai discussion club last week, it took President Putin only a few sentences to debunk the whole Clinton machine narrative with a bang:\n?Another mythical and imaginary problem is what I can only call the hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election. The United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police.You would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth.\nI have to ask myself and ask you too: Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American people?s choice? America is not some kind of ?banana republic?, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong.?\nReality, though, continues to insist on offering multiple, overlapping banana republic instances, configuring a giant black hole of transparency.\nAnthropologist Janine Wedel has been one of the few in Clinton-linked US mainstream media acknowledging how Bill Clinton, while Hillary was Secretary of State, perfected his version of ?philantro-capitalism? (actually a money laundering ?pay to play? racket), a practice ?by no means confined to the Clintons?.\nAnd the racket prospered with inbuilt nuggets, such as Hillary being perfectly aware that prime Clinton Foundation donors Qatar and Saudi Arabia were also financing ISIS/ISIL/Daesh.\nHuma, the Fall Princess Now, less than a week before the election, we have come to the crucial juncture where the WikiLeaks revelations are merging with the FBI investigations - all three of them.\nExhibit A is this WikiLeaks bombshell ; Peter Kadzik, who?s now in charge of the Department of Justice (DOJ) probe into the 650,000 emails found on the laptop shared by Clinton?s right-hand woman Huma Abedin and her estranged, pervert husband Anthony Wiener, is a Clinton asset.\nNot only Kadzik was an attorney for Marc Rich when he was pardoned by Bill Clinton; Podesta ? as also revealed by WikiLeaks - thanked Kadzik for keeping him ?out of jail? ; and it was Kadzik who gave Podesta a secret heads up on the Clinton email investigation.\nThe Clinton machine, starring a self-described virtuous Madonna, is actually a pretty nasty business. Huma and her family?s close connections to Saudi Arabia ? and the Muslim Brotherhood ? are legendary (that includes her brother Hassan, who works for Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi). Podesta, by the way, is a handsomely remunerated lobbyist for Saudi Arabia in Washington; that?s part of the Clinton Foundation connection.\nYet now, with Huma in the spotlight ? still maintaining she didn?t know all those emails were in her and Wiener?s laptop - it?s no wonder Hillary has instantly downgraded her, publicly, to ?one of my aides? . She used to be Hillary?s ersatz ?daughter? ; now she?s being framed as The Fall Princess.\nAnd that brings us to the intersection of those three FBI investigations; on Hillary?s Subterranean Email Server (in theory closed by FBI?s Comey last summer); on the Clinton Foundation; and on Wiener?s sexting of minors. The FBI has been investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year now. Let?s try to cut a long story short.\nFollow the evidence Last July, the DOJ ? under Clinton/Obama asset Loretta Lynch - decided not to prosecute anyone on Emailgate. And yet FBI director Comey ? who nonetheless stressed Hillary?s ?extreme carelessness? ? turbo-charged his no-denial mode on another investigation, as in the FBI ?sought to refocus the Clinton Foundation probe.?\nSoon we had Clinton Foundation FBI investigators trying to get access to all the emails turned over in the Emailgate investigation. The East District of New York refused it. Very important point; up to 2015, guess who was the US attorney at the East District; Clinton/Obama asset Lynch.\nEnter an extra layer of legalese. Less than two months ago, the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators discovered they could not have access to any Emailgate material that was connected to immunity agreements.\nBut then, roughly a month ago, another FBI team captured the by now famous laptop shared by Huma and Wiener - using a warrant allowing only a probe on Weiner?s sexting of a 15-year-old girl. Subsequently they found Huma Abedin emails at all her accounts ? from Humaabedin@yahoo.com to the crucial huma@clintonemail.com . This meant not only that Huma was forwarding State Dept. emails to her private accounts, but also that Hillary was sending emails from the ?secret? clintonemail.com to Huma at yahoo.com.\nNo one knew for sure, but some of these emails might be duplicates of those the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators could not access because of the pesky immunity agreements.\nWhat?s established by now is that the metadata in the Huma/Wiener laptop was duly examined. Now picture both teams of FBI investigators ? Clinton Foundation and pervert Wiener ? comparing notes. And then they decide Huma?s emails are ?relevant?.\nKey questions apply; and the most pressing is how the emails were deemed ?relevant? if the investigators could only examine the metadata. What matters is that Comey certainly was made aware of the content of the emails ? a potential game-changer. That?s why one of my sources insists his decision to go public came from above.\nThe other key question now is whether the DOJ ? via Kadzik? - will once again thwart another investigation, this time on the Clinton Foundation. Senior, serious FBI agents won?t take that ? massive euphemism ? kindly.\nThe FBI has been on the Clinton Foundation for over a year. Now, arguably, they are loaded with evidence ? and they won?t quit. Winning the presidency now seems to be the least of Hillary Clinton?s Bonfire of Scandals? problems.\nPepe Escobar is an independent geopolitical analyst.

Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) November 6, 2016\nBelow is the full letter from FBI Director Comey, with the key section highlighted.\nThe Clinton campaign is exuberant...\nWe were always confident nothing would cause the July decision to be revisited.

Brown | Return of Kings - October 27, 2016 Comments \nThe recent Wikileaks revelations about the Clintons, the Clinton campaign, media collusion, and the various hypocrisies of the Democratic Party are groundbreaking in both their scope and depth. \nThe sheer number of hacked emails covering so many topics, combined with the shadiness of the activities involved, should have already handed Donald Trump the election. \nAlas, the media, whose collusion with the Clinton campaign is laid out in many of the emails, will not have a bar of reporting them in a professional, ethical fashion. The following seven email exchanges have either been deliberately suppressed by mainstream outlets or given the slimmest coverage to feebly ward off accusations that they are in the de facto service (or pocket) of Hillary Clinton. \n1. ※Women＊s advocate§ Hillary Clinton admits that Saudi Arabia and Qatar fund ISIS, but refuses to rebuke them for it \nAfter rounding on Donald Trump for very tamely calling former Miss Universe Alicia Machado ※Miss Piggy,§ one might think that Hillary Clinton has the interests of women at heart.

    "text": "ABC Poll Oversamples Dems by 9%, Claims Hillary Leading Mainstream media oversampling Democrats to create fake Hillary lead Kit Daniels - October 27, 2016 Comments \nIn another example of poll rigging, an ABC presidential poll surveyed 9% more Democrats than Republicans and showed Hillary Clinton leading by 12% 每 with a 3% sampling error! \nABC claims it＊s a ※12-point race§ with Clinton ahead after polling a ※random§ national sample of 1,155 likely voters, but the poll＊s methodology reveals the poll was heavily biased in favor of Hillary. \n※Results have a margin of sampling error of 3 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 36-27-31 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents,§ ABC said near the bottom of the poll. \nOf course Hillary will be ahead in polls dominated by Democrats, but ABC and other mainstream media outlets are betting that voters won＊t bother to look at a poll＊s methodology to find the bias. \nEven if there＊s more registered Democrats than Republicans nationally, they don＊t outnumber them by nearly 10% because otherwise Republicans wouldn＊t be winning national races. \n※These kind of misleading polls really strike at their credibility as pollsters,§ wrote media analyst Aaron Rossiter. ※They seem to want the big Hillary lead, probably to throw off the poll averages and suppress Republican voter turnout.§ \nAnd if the fact that mainstream polls are ※adjusted§ to manufacture a Hillary lead still sounds doubtful to you, just read this leaked email from Democratic consultant Tom Matzzie: \n※I also want to get your Atlas folks to recommend oversamples for our polling before we start in February. By market, regions, etc. I want to get this all compiled into one set of recommendations so we can maximize what we get out of our media polling.§ \nThe email also includes this report from The Atlas Project on how to rig polls to get the desired result: \nFor example, in Florida, a key battleground state, Democratic consultants recommended oversampling African-American and Hispanic voters who lean Democratic so the polls favor Democrat candidates: \n每 General election benchmark, 800 sample, with potential over samples in key districts/regions \n每 Benchmark polling in targeted races, with ethnic over samples as needed \n每 Targeting tracking polls in key races, with ethnic over samples as needed",

Paul Joseph Watson - October 28, 2016 Comments \nDo you stand ※with her§ nuclear holocaust? \nHillary Clinton has vowed to use military assets against Russia if Moscow is merely suspected of having engaged in a cyber attack. \nHillary Clinton has already proven that she is a sociopathic warmonger. Her bloodthirsty zeal to overthrow Gaddafi in Libya directly led to the rise of ISIS, the international migrant crisis and a wrecked continent. \nIf she is elected, Hillary will push for arming jihadist rebels in Syria with even more sophisticated weaponry and a no fly zone over the country 每 an effective declaration of war on the Syrian government and its ally, Russia. \nA vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for world war three.

Bush 2.0 每 that＊s why she is supported by a plethora of ＆Never Trump＊ neo-cons who are salivating over the prospect of getting back into power and launching new wars of aggression. \nExcept this time the enemy won＊t be Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi or any other third world nation with a flimsy, virtually non-existent army. \nThe enemy will be Russia 每 a country with a 3 million man army and a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons. \nIt is important to not fall prey to normalcy bias. Just because there hasn＊t been a major conflict in most our our lifetimes doesn＊t mean it can＊t happen. The history of humanity is the history of warfare. \nA vote for Hillary is a vote for World War 3. \nMake this message go viral by sharing this video .

Marketing executive Bronfein tells Podesta that Clinton ※may not be the best face§ to attract younger voters and that she needs to utilize ※trending figures§ as par of an ※infusion to pull younger voters§ because ※that＊s the crap that young people pay attention to§. Bronfein goes on to state, ※It＊s f**king dumb but being ※cool§ counts for more than it maybe should.§ She references Bill Clinton＊s saxophone playing as an example of this before asserting, ※I hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature, they ※follow§. So if someone they identify as cool endorses 每 they will likely fall in line with that candidate.§ Bronfein is introduced to John Podesta in another email as someone who ※could be immensely helpful in improving HRC＊s connection to millennials.§ The email is yet another example of the disdain that Hillary insiders have for Clinton＊s own voters. Yesterday, we highlighted how Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accused Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being ※stupid§. In an audio recording leaked earlier this month, Hillary Clinton was caught on tape saying Bernie Sanders supporters are ※living in their parents＊ basement§ and had bought into a ※false promise§.

    "text": "3 Competing Theories On Why The FBI Re-opened The Hillary Email Server Investigation The FBI normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation American Thinker   \nThere is no question that re-opening the FBI Investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s email server is a big deal. The FBI normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation. NBC reports: \nThe FBI is reviewing a new batch of Hillary Clinton emails, bureau director James Comey said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday. \n※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation ＃ I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,§ he wrote. \nThe very first thing to note is that Comey made no mention of a grand jury. The emails whose existence he learned of may have been the result of a subpoena in another investigation. If that is the case, further subpoenas are quite possible, a tool that was left unused in the investigation to date. \nThere are 3 competing theories as to why he might be doing this now that come to mind. He might be seeking to restore his badly damaged reputation, recognizing that the damage he has inflicted on the FBI is substantial. Three days ago, American Thinker published an open letter from a retired FBI Agent, Hugh Galyean, that laid out some of the damage Comey has inflicted on the institution he leads. There is little doubt that this reached many in the FBI family, putting in print what people have only whispered about. If those silenced voices start speaking out, Comey could face a serious loss of face. In this scenario, he is heading off a staff rebellion, possibly including mass resignations. Rush Limbaugh today discussed an alternative theory, that by announcing an FBI Investigation resuming, Comey is putting a lid on further attention to Wikileaks. I guess this means that Clinton forces will argue we must wait for the investigation to be complete (after the election) before speaking about what the evil Russians are planting into our politics. It is possible that something so dramatic came up in the pertinent emails that postponing a public reaction by not announcing the reopening of the investigation would, be regarded as political interference by covering up a smoking gun until after the election. In this scenario, Comey is assuming the evidence cannot be suppressed, and that he would be held accountable after it comes out. This scenario also indicates that we could be headed for a constitutional crisis, involving the possible indictment of a president-elect before an election. Or the evidence being turned over to the House of Representatives for impeachment hearings. \nWe＊ll know more in the coming days, and I am sure there are other possible theories and motives. It is shame that we have to speculate, and that the once-respected FBI director is now subject to analysis of his political gamesmanship.

    "text": "Store 2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election Unearthed tape: 'We should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win' Observer   \nOn September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. \nThe tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. \nThe tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton＊s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is ※rigged.§ \nSpeaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).",

But the real question to ask may be: Why isn＊t the FBI investigating Hillary＊s actual ties to the Russians which can be found herein this article? Please share this post everywhere, make it go viral! \nRelated: Rancher Dwight Hammond threatened with ※bullet§: Exclusive Interview \nPRINCETON, Ore. ( INTELLIHUB ) 〞 As it turns out there＊s a lot more to the story behind the Malheur Wildlife Refuge 〞 a whole lot more每and this article is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. \nAs you may or may not know, Intellihub reported on Jan. 4, that the Hammond＊s ranch and other ranch-lands surrounding the refuge sit atop a vast swath of precious metals, minerals, and uranium that＊s heavily desired by not only the federal government, but foreign entities as well. \nHowever, at the time of the article＊s publication the federal government＊s full motive to seize the land was not yet known other than the fact that these elements do exist in the vicinity and are invaluable. \nNow, after further investigation, more pieces of the puzzle have been put in place and you＊re not going to believe what characters are involved. \nI＊ll give you a hint 〞 one of them is currently being investigated by the FBI and is also running on the Democratic ticket in hopes of becoming the next President of the United States. That＊s right, you guessed it每none other than Hillary Rodham Clinton of the notorious Clinton crime family . \nHillary and her foundation are implicated in the dastardly scheme along with the Russian State Nuclear Energy Corporation, Rosatom, and a few dubious Canadian elite, which is where the news gets really bad. \nRosatom is ranked #2 globally in uranium reserves and #1 globally for annual uranium extraction. The sheer power, strength, and size of the corporation is undeniable. Rostom is a major power-player in today＊s world and didn＊t become that way for no reason. \nYou see, Rosatom wanted to expand their operations into America and needed a way in. So, in 2013, Rosatom acquired a Canadian company named Uranium One as part of a sinister side deal which involved multiple parties. Ultimately the deal opened a typically secure and closed-door, thus allowing the Russians to salt their way into Continental United States as part of a vast and extensive plan to mine Uranium ore out of states like Wyoming and Oregon. \nThe deal was essentially brokered by Hillary and was ran through the Clinton Foundation using Canadian-backed contributions as a cover. With one swoop of a pen the bitch sold out the American people and one-fifth of America＊s uranium resources to the Russians. \nIn April of 2015, two reporters for the New York Times boldly reported how the plan worked: At the heart of the tale are several men, leaders of the Canadian mining industry, who have been major donors to the charitable endeavors of former President Bill Clinton and his family. Members of that group built, financed and eventually sold off to the Russians a company that would become known as Uranium One. Beyond mines in Kazakhstan that are among the most lucrative in the world, the sale gave the Russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States. Since uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for national security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of United States government agencies. Among the agencies that eventually signed off was the State Department, then headed by Mr. Clinton＊s wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton . As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One＊s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well. And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock. At the time, both Rosatom and the United States government made promises intended to ease concerns about ceding control of the company＊s assets to the Russians. Those promises have been repeatedly broken, records show. [＃] Soon, Uranium One began to snap up companies with assets in the United States. In April 2007, it announced the purchase of a uranium mill in Utah and more than 38,000 acres of uranium exploration properties in four Western states , followed quickly by the acquisition of the Energy Metals Corporation and its uranium holdings in Wyoming, Texas and Utah. That deal made clear that Uranium One was intent on becoming ※a powerhouse in the United States uranium sector with the potential to become the domestic supplier of choice for U.S. utilities,§ the company declared. [＃] While the United States gets one-fifth of its electrical power from nuclear plants, it produces only around 20 percent of the uranium it needs, and most plants have only 18 to 36 months of reserves, according to Marin Katusa, author of ※The Colder War: How the Global Energy Trade Slipped From America＊s Grasp.§ ※The Russians are easily winning the uranium war, and nobody＊s talking about it,§ said Mr. Katusa, who explores the implications of the Uranium One deal in his book. ※It＊s not just a domestic issue but a foreign policy issue, too.§ Yes, the Russians are winning the ※uranium war,§ thanks to Hillary. Additionally BLM documentation shows: In September 2011, a representative from Oregon Energy, L.L.C. (formally Uranium One), met with local citizens, and county and state officials, to discuss the possibility of opening a uranium oxide (※yellowcake§) mine in southern Malheur County in southeastern Oregon. Oregon Energy is interested in developing a 17-Claim parcel of land known as the Aurora Project through an open pit mining method. Besides the mine, there would be a mill for processing. The claim area occupies about 450 acres and is also referred to as the ※New U§ uranium claims. On May 7, 2012, Oregon Energy LLC made a presentation to the BLM outlining its plans for development for the mine. The Vale District has agreed to work with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife on mitigation for the ※New U§ uranium claims, which are located in core sage grouse habitat. Although the lands encompassing the claims have been designated core, the area is frequented by rockhounds and hunters, and has a crisscrossing of off-highway vehicle (OHV) roads and other significant land disturbance from the defunct Bretz Mercury Mine, abandoned in the 1960s. However, by the fall of 2012 the company said that it was putting its plans for the mine on hold until the uncertainty surrounding sage grouse issues was resolved. Once again the Whore of Babylon , Hillary Clinton, her foundation, and other members of government, have literally been caught conducting illicit, illegal, and treasonous, activities right underneath the noses of the American people and are in no way being held accountable. Moreover she has the nerve to run for president! Are you kidding me? Now Oregon Governor Kate Brown has stepped in, calling for a ＆swift＊ resolution to the armed occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, clearly shilling for the Dems, criminally assisting them with their master plan to sellout every last bit of America＊s public lands to foreign entities like Uranium One, fully eviscerating whats left of the U.S. Constitution. So there you have it每rogue criminal factions of government are operating at all levels and are actually conspiring together to allow foreign corporations to invade and mine rich American resources, including uranium, from lands owned by the people. Uranium One＊s slogan is: ※Success through aggressive mine and land acquisition.§ \nAdditionally, President Obama has signed executive orders allowing the Department of the Interior to grab publicly owned lands. Update 1:29 p.m.: World Net daily published an article back in 1998 titled ※Federal Land Grab Called ＆Political＊.§ In the article he author points out how Utah Republican Jame Hansen authored a bill at the time known as the ※Utah Schools and Lands Exchange Act of 1998.§ According to the report, this bill passed in June of 1998, and gave ※Utah 139,000 acres of federally held land, certain mineral rights, and $50 million in exchange for all of Utah＊s claims to lands within national parks, monuments, forests and federal areas§ under then U.S. President Bill Clinton＊s orders, further demonstration how the Clinton Crime Family has been using their vast political influence to loot some of the best assets from the Corporation of the United States, selling them for pennies on the dollar to private foreign corporations and one world bodies like the United Nations. Additionally we find this whole animal goes back the the Ronald Regan era每and possibly further. HCN.org reported back in 2004: [＃] President Ronald Reagan and his advisors looked across the West＊s public lands and saw dollar signs. Money was something they desperately needed in 1982, as the national deficit hit $128 billion. So James Watt, then U.S. secretary of the Interior, and John R. Block, the secretary of Agriculture, earmarked 35 million acres, or 5 percent of the nation＊s public lands (excluding Alaska), for the auction block. The plan to privatize public lands was met with outrage and skepticism, not only from Western liberals such as Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, but also from conservatives like Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, who objected because the states were cut out of the deal. Watt eventually withdrew Interior lands from the sale; shortly thereafter, the Forest Service＊s sale lost steam, too. However unpopular the proposed sales were, they weren＊t illegal. And the idea didn＊t go away. The framework for selling public lands has inched forward since the Clinton administration, and now the Interior Department wants to give it a higher priority. The 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) required the Bureau of Land Management to identify lands that were ※uneconomical to manage,§ or that stood in the way of a community＊s development. But the BLM lacked a strong incentive to identify such sellable lands: Under FLPMA, any money received from their sale would go directly into the U.S. Treasury, rather than into the agency＊s own coffers. Then, in 2000, Congress and the Clinton administration passed the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA), which changed how profits from BLM land sales were distributed. Twenty percent of any land-sale revenue would go toward the BLM＊s administration costs, while the other 80 percent had to be used to buy private inholdings within BLM lands that contained ※exceptional resources.§ The act was based on a land disposal and acquisition mechanism in the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998, which was crafted to accommodate Las Vegas＊ rapid expansion onto neighboring public lands. But FLTFA＊s profit scheme applied only to sellable lands identified before July 25, 2000. At that time, the BLM estimated it had 3.3 million acres of sellable land, but thanks to better inventories, its estimate has since shrunk to as low as 330,000 acres. From 2001 to 2003, the BLM sold almost 11,000 acres under FLTFA. Note: We know some of the land acquired by Uranium One is in Oregon and we know there are precious metals on and near the Hammond Ranch. Put two and two together. Stay tuned for more updates and confirmation as it is becoming increasingly clear that other companies and government entities are most likely also involved. The government, alongside private companies (including foreign-owned), are in the middle of a massive criminal land grab which the mainstream media is largely ignoring, instead opting to paint those in Oregon as crazy anti-government extremists. In other words, members of the mainstream media are directly responsible for helping to allow this takeover to happen.

    "text": "VIDEOS Will Barack Obama delay or suspend the election if Hillary is forced out by the new FBI email investigation? An A.I. system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of #Hillary By Michael Snyder - November 3, 2016 \nJust when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton＊s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails ※did not come from her private server§, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the ※emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry§, and according to some reports there may be ※potentially thousands§ of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? \nLet＊s take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ After recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ※appear to be pertinent§ to the email probe. ※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,§ Comey wrote the chairmen. ※I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.§ \nAt this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton＊s closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton＊s Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ We don＊t know what this means yet except that it＊s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that＊s where we are＃ Is it a certainty that we won＊t learn before the election? I＊m not sure it＊s a certainty we won＊t learn before the election. One thing is, it＊s possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ \nIf the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? \nIt is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. \nSo those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. \nBut if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year＊s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group＊s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nIt would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. \nIn such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be ※fair§ until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. \nMeanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. \nAnd CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. \nWithout Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. \nSo if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. \nAt this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.",

    "title": "A Hillary Clinton indictment is coming",
    "text": "VIDEOS A Hillary Clinton indictment is coming At this point, the struggle between the FBI and the Department of Justice is being described as ※a civil war§ By Michael Snyder - November 4, 2016 Doesn＊t it seem like most of us are collectively holding our breath as we wait to see what will happen with this election? We are now only a handful of days away from election day and the polls have really tightened up , there are unprecedented concerns about post-election violence , and the Democratic nominee for president could be indicted literally any day now. The American people are going to be absolutely shocked when the FBI finally reveals what they have discovered regarding Hillary Clinton＊s mishandling of classified materials, corruption at the Clinton Foundation, and other ※stomach churning§ matters that normally aren＊t topics of polite conversation. Without a doubt, a Hillary Clinton indictment is coming. The only question now is when it will happen. \nThe moment that FBI Director James Comey sent his letter to Congress, he knew that someone＊s head was going on the chopping block. If Hillary Clinton does not get indicted, Comey＊s career is over and there is a very good chance that he will be going to prison instead. There is no way that he would have ever put himself on the line like this if extremely powerful evidence had not already been found against Clinton. \nBecause without a doubt, the vultures are circling. Just consider what House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi recently told CNN about Comey＃ ＃Nancy Pelosi has claimed that FBI Director Comey is ※not in the right job,§ following his decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s misuse of a private email server. ※Maybe he＊s not in the right job,§ Pelosi said in an interview with CNN . ※I think that we have to just get through this election and just see what the casualties are along the way,§ she continued, refusing to answer a question on whether she thought the FBI director should resign. \nIf it turns out that this investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s emails was renewed for no good reason, Comey is going to be strung out to dry, and he knows this. \nFortunately for Comey, there are reports that indicate that the evidence the FBI is compiling in this case is absolutely overwhelming. The following comes from Infowars ＃ According to other uncovered emails, Abedin and Clinton both sent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts including Weiner＊s unsecured campaign web site which is managed by Democratic political consultants in Washington D.C. Weiner maintained little known email accounts that the couple shared on the website anthonyweiner.com. Weiner, a former seven-term Democratic Congressman from New York, primarily used that domain to campaign for Congress and for his failed mayoral bid of New York City. At one point, FBI sources said, Abedin and Clinton＊s classified and top secret State Department documents and emails were stored in Weiner＊s email on a server shared with a dog grooming service and a western Canadian bicycle shop. \nIf you even send a single classified document outside of a secure channel that is a major criminal offense. \nSo if there are ※thousands§ of these emails as some reports are indicating, that should be enough to lock Hillary Clinton up for the rest of her life. According to investigative journalist Jerome Corsi , what Clinton and her close associates have done is ※an obvious violation of the law§＃ ※The rules for handling classified materials is you＊ve got to handle them on secured channels. You can＊t let them go on an insecure channel,§ Corsi said. ※Clearly, sending these emails to Yahoo.com 每 and we know some of them had classified material because they＊ve been marked classified 每 is a violation of the law, and it doesn＊t require intent.§ He said Clinton and Abedin could have avoided this entire scandal by establishing secure government accounts and not sending any of it to private accounts. ※This was such an obvious violation of law, and perhaps leading to an espionage case or a treason case, that when presented to Comey, he really had no alternative than to go forward,§ Corsi said. \nBut this isn＊t the only investigation that could lead to a Hillary Clinton indictment. According to Fox News Channel＊s Bret Baier , the FBI investigation into corruption at the Clinton Foundation is also ※likely to lead to an indictment§＃ Two sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI＊s investigations told Fox News Wednesday that a probe of the Clinton Foundation is likely to lead to an indictment . \nFox News＊s Bret Baier said Wednesday that the FBI probe into a possible pay-to-play scheme between Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation has been going on for over a year.Sources told the news network that the investigation, which is conducted by the White Collar Crime division of the FBI, is a ※very high priority.§ \nOne of the anonymous sources told Baier that the amount of evidence now being uncovered is equivalent to ※an avalanche coming in every day.§ \nIf what these two sources have told Baier is true, then this changes everything. The following is how Real Clear Politics summarized the most important pieces of information from this report＃ 1. The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. 2. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time. 3. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton＊s secret server on Anthony Weiner＊s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature. 4. Sources within the FBI have told Baier that an indictment is ※likely§ in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, ※barring some obstruction in some way§ from the Justice Department. 5. FBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary Clinton＊s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information have been taken from it. \nIt is also being reported that the Department of Justice tried unsuccessfully to stop the investigation into the Clinton Foundation. \nAt this point, the struggle between the FBI and the Department of Justice is being described as ※a civil war§. The Department of Justice is obviously extremely pro-Clinton, and meanwhile over at the FBI many agents consider Hillary Clinton to be ※the antichrist personified§ ＃ The currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is ※the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,§ and that ※the reason why they＊re leaking is they＊re pro-Trump.§ The agent called the bureau ※Trumplandia§, with some colleagues openly discussing voting for a GOP nominee who has garnered unprecedented condemnation from the party＊s national security wing and who has pledged to jail Clinton if elected. \nPerhaps if Hillary Clinton had not made it a habit to regularly cuss out Secret Service agents and other law enforcement personnel over the past several decades she would have more friends in the FBI. \nTo a certain extent, this is simply a case of the chickens coming home to roost. \nAnd at this point, even some of Hillary＊s biggest supporters in the media are turning on her. Just consider what Chris Matthews of CNBC is saying about her＃ ※You know what I think? I＊m going to be more judgmental than Beth who＊s a straight reporter. I＊ll make a judgment. Every time I watch a politician engage in a certain pattern of behavior before they go to the White House, they continue to engage in that pattern afterwards. People don＊t change because we swear them into the White House. They become that person big-time. And the Clintons were raising money like this hand over hand, hand over fist, back in 1996, using〞we called it Motel 6. They were hoarding them in, pulling them in by train loads of contributors and then letting them sit in the Lincoln bedroom for a while and charging them by the hour. You can still vote for Hillary Clinton, but remember, you＊re getting this as part of the package, because that＊s been their pattern. ※ \nVoting has already begun in most states, and Americans are facing a historic choice. \nIf they choose to elect the most wicked politician of this generation despite everything that has been revealed about her, I think that will speak volumes about where we stand as a nation. \nOur leaders in Washington D.C. reflect who we are as a country. If if we willingly send Hillary Clinton to the White House, the truth is that we will fully deserve everything that happens to us afterwards.",

    "text": "VIDEOS Here＊s what happened when a Hillary supporting MIT professor decided to analyze her emails＃ In practice, as recent history has repeatedly shown, the right to vote, by itself, is no guarantee of liberty By Michael Krieger - November 7, 2016 \nA few days ago, Cesar A. Hidalgo published a very important article titled, What I Learned From Visualizing Hillary Clinton＊s Emails . \nSo who is Cesar Hidalgo? C谷sar A. Hidalgo is associate professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab and the author of Why Information Grows: The evolution of order from atoms to economies. He has also lead the creation of data visualization sites that have received more than 100 million views, including datausa.io, dataviva.info, atlas.media.mit.edu, immersion.media.mit.edu, pantheon.media.mit.edu, streetscore.media.mit.edu, and others (see chidalgo.com for more details). \nAt this point, I＊m sure you＊re wondering why I＊m highlighting this guy＊s post two days before the Presidential election. It＊s for two reasons. First, the piece offers a very good representation of the sort of peer pressure that can come down upon an academic for being seen as having the ※wrong§ political opinion. Second, and perhaps most important, his email visualization tool taught him that the current state of our government in these United States simply can＊t achieve the best outcomes for the public at current scale (size, geographic/cultural diversity, etc). \nWith all that out of the way, I＊m going to highlight what I found to be the most powerful part of his piece. \nEnjoy: So what did we learn by making this dataset accessible? We learned a few things about what Clinton＊s emails said, about how the media works, and about how people interpreted the project. We made clinton.media.mit.edu publicly available last Friday night (October 28, 2016). We launched with a single story , written by Alejandra Vargas from Univision. My intuition was that the story was likely to get picked up by other news sources. After all, the tool facilitated people＊s ability to read and understand the content of these emails, and the connections of the people involved in them. But I was wrong〞it has been nearly a week since we released the project and no other major news source has picked up the story, despite having been viewed by more than 300,000 people in less than a week. So how did we get so much traffic without any news coverage? The answer is social media. So far, the tool has been shared widely on Twitter, Facebook, and for a brief but intense time, on Reddit. Its spread has been fueled by different motives, and also, has been battled in different ways. Many reporters shared the news on their personal accounts understanding that the tool represents a different form of data reporting, or data journalism: one where people are provided with a tool that facilitates their ability to explore a relevant dataset, instead of being provided with a story summarizing a reporter＊s description of that dataset. Another group of people that shared the news were interface designers, who understand that there is a need to improve the tabular interface of present day email clients, and that the inbox we presented in this project was an attractive new alternative. But many people also shared our site claiming that this was evidence of Clinton＊s corruption, and that the site supported Trump. More on that later. But the spread of the site was not without its detractors. A few hours after we released the site I received a message from a friend telling me that what I had done was ※a huge mistake§ and that I should have waited to post this until ※later in the year.§ A few days later, outside my lab, a member of a neighboring research group called me a ※Trump supporter§ and told me that I should have only made that site available if it also included Trump＊s emails. I told him that I would be happy to include them, but I had no access to the data. In haste, this colleague began emailing me news articles, none of which provided access to the alleged public dataset of Trump emails. Later, a friend of one of my students posted the news on Reddit, where it went viral. And I mean really viral. It became the top story of the Internetisbeautiful subreddit, and made it to Reddit＊s front page. It collected more than 3,000 upvotes and 700 comments. But as the story peaked, a moderator single-handedly removed it in an authoritarian move, and justified this unilateral silencing of the post by adding a rule banning ※sites that serve a political agenda or that otherwise induce drama.§ Of course, the rule was added AFTER the post was removed. Reddit appears to be rampant with censorship these days. So when it comes to media, social or not, I learned that providing information directly to people so that they can inspect it and evaluate it, is a value that many people consider second to supporting their preferred electoral choice. The twist is that I don＊t support Trump. In fact, I don＊t support him at all. I think he is potentially a threat to global security, and also, a candidate that has shown repeatedly to be a dividing rather than unifying force. He has failed to respect contracts numerous times, defrauding contractors; and he certainly has shown little respect for people＊s development by creating a fraudulent university. So I think he is ill prepared for most jobs, including a difficult one like that of being president. I support Clinton in this election, and even though I don＊t get to vote (As a green card holder I just pay taxes), I want her to win next Tuesday. I really do. But I understand that this is my own personal choice, a choice that I want to make sure is informed by my ability to evaluate information about the candidates directly, and by a media that is more transparent than the one we now have. Trust me, if I had Trump＊s tax records, I would also think it is a good idea to make a tool that makes them more easily digestible. But my reason to make that tool, once again, would not come from my support for Clinton, or my opposition to Trump. It would come from my support for a society where people have direct access to relevant sources of information through well-designed data visualization tools. Now here＊s where we get into very important lessons about the future. So what did I learn about Clinton＊s emails? One of the advantages of helping design a data visualization tool is that you get an intimate understanding of the data you are visualizing. After all, you have to explore the data and use the tool to make dozens of design decisions. In this case, the development cycle was particularly fast, but nevertheless I got to learn a few things about the data. Of course, the whole point of making this tool is that you can use it to come up with your own interpretation of the data. That said, you might be curious about mine, so I＊ll share it with you too. What I saw on Clinton＊s emails was not surprising to me. It involved a relatively small group of people talking about what language to use when communicating with other people. Also, it involved many unresponded-to emails. Many conversations revolved around what words to use or avoid, and what topics to focus on, or how to avoid some topics, when speaking in public or in meetings. This is not surprising to me because I＊ve met many politicians in my life, including a few presidents and dozens of ministers and governors, so I know that what work means to many people in this line of work, on a daily basis, is strategizing what to say and being careful about how to say it. I am sure that if we had access to Trump＊s emails we would see plenty of the same behavior. So what I got from reading some of Clinton＊s email is another piece of evidence confirming my intuition that political systems scale poorly. The most influential actors on them are spending a substantial fraction of their mental capacity thinking about how to communicate, and do not have the bandwidth needed to deal with many incoming messages (the unresponded-to emails). This is not surprising considering the large number of people they interact with (although this dataset is rather small. I send 8k emails a year and receive 30k. In this dataset Clinton is sending only 2K emails a year). Our modern political world is one where a few need to interact with many, so they have no time for deep relationships?〞?they physically cannot. So what we are left is with a world of first impressions and public opinion, where the choice of words matters enormously, and becomes central to the job. Yet, the chronic lack of time that comes from having a system where few people govern many, and that leads people to strategize every word, is not Clinton＊s fault. It is just a bug that affects all modern political systems, which are ancient Greek democracies that were not designed to deal with hundreds of millions of people. On another note, this exercise also helped me reaffirm my belief that the best way to learn about the media is not by reading the news, but by being news. I＊ve had the fortune, and misfortune, to have been news many times. This time, I honestly thought that we had a piece of content that some media channels would be interested in and that it would get picked up easily. I have many reporter friends who are enthusiastic about new forms of data journalism, and that actually have been positive and encouraging this week. So I imagined that there was a good chance that a reporter would see the site, go to his or her editor, and say: ※Hey, I have an interactive data visualization of all Clinton＊s emails. Can I write a story on it?§ and the editor would say: ※Of course, make it quick.§ I don＊t know if these conversations actually happened, but given the large volume of traffic our project received I would be surprised if they didn＊t. I learned that the outcome was not the one I intuited. And this brings me to my final point, which is that while I support Clinton in this election, and I think Trump is a bad choice for president (a really bad one), I still think that we should work on the creation of tools that improve the ability of people to personalize scrutinize politically relevant information. I now understand that much of the U.S. media may not share that view with me, and that I think this is an important point of reflection. I hope the media takes some time to think about this on November 9 (or the week after). Also, the large number of people who were unable to interpret our tool as anything but an effort to support or oppose a political candidate?〞?and that was true for both liberals and conservatives?〞?speaks to me about an ineffective public sphere. And that＊s something I think we should all be concerned about. This polarization is not just a clich谷. It is a crippling societal condition that is expressed in the inability of people to see any merit, or any point, in opposing views. That＊s a dangerous, and chronic, institutional disease that is expressed also in the inability of people to criticize their own candidates, because they fear being confused with someone their peers will interpret as a supporter of the opposing candidate. If you cannot see any merit in the candidate you oppose, even in one or two of the many points that have been made, you may have it. So that＊s how this election has muddled the gears of democracy. When we cannot learn from those we oppose, or agree when they have a valid point, our learning stops. We keep on talking past each other. I know that this election has made learning from those we oppose particularly difficult, but the difficult tests are the ones that truly show us what we are really made of. These are the situations that push us to see past   we don＊t like, or don＊t agree on, so we can rescue a lesson. You may not agree with me, but I hope at least I gave you something to think about. While his points about media censorship and peer pressure are self-explanatory, I want to take a quick moment to discuss his most meaningful insight, which is the idea that ※ political systems scale poorly.§ This is hugely important, because as the current status quo system collapses, many of us in the Western world will be presented with an incredible opportunity to do things completely different. Unfortunately, none of the candidates in the 2016 election (including Sanders and Trump) have been promoting the idea of political decentralization, which is the direction I think we need to move toward. In voting for Brexit, that＊s exactly what the British people professed a preference for, and it＊s what we need here in America. In some important ways, I think we should look back toward the original concept of government as understood by our founders. A loose-knit collection of largely self-governing states that are bonded together in certain important ways, yet independent and sovereign in all other ways. Indeed, I think we can break things up even further than that, but let＊s start there for the time being. If we want to stick with representative democracy, I think for it to work best, it needs to be very local. I think the future of mankind depends on us getting our political systems right, and I think governance has to be shifted to the local level as much as possible. This all reminds me of Aldous Huxley＊s extremely prescient warning in his 1958 book Brave New World revised (see my review of it), in which he wrote: Or take the right to vote. In principle, it is a great privilege. In practice, as recent history has repeatedly shown, the right to vote, by itself, is no guarantee of liberty. Therefore, if you wish to avoid dictatorship by referendum, break up modern society＊s merely functional collectives into self-governing, voluntarily co-operating groups, capable of functioning outside the bureaucratic systems of Big Business and Big Government. Bottom line: We need to decentralize everything, especially government.",

    "text": "Hillary＊s crime family: End of days for the U.S.A Based on the foregoing, SOMEONE got to Comey〞somewhere along the line By Daily Coin - November 8, 2016 \nAn investor in Dave＊s fund emailed him asking which way Colorado would vote tomorrow. He replied: ※Depends on who counts the votes. I don＊t believe this is a fair election. I think the Clinton crime machine, with the help of George Soros and a few others, have everything under their control now.§ \nAfter taking the better part of a year to sift through 55,000 emails in analyzing Hillary Clinton＊s behavior with regard to conducting classified Government business on her private server 每 which apparently was accessible to hackers and, surreptitiously, by Anthony Wieners porn laptop 每 Jim Comey determined in 8 days that 650,000 emails downloaded from Hillary＊s private server were not relevant. \nSorry Jim, that＊s impossible to believe. One highly plausible is that operatives in the Deep State shut down the FBI investigation in order to preserve the treasure trove of material that will give it power over Clinton＊s Presidency. The SoT was perplexed by this, so we asked John Titus his take on this. His answer was quite compelling: \nHere＊s what I＊m reasonably sure of, based on experience. (1) Jim Comey looked sick when, at the conclusion of round one, and having proven beyond all doubt that Hillary violateed 18 U.S.C 793(f), he said no reasonable prosecutor would charge her. He wasn＊t acting. Bad acting comes right through camera lens, and that man looked like he was about to vomit when he left that dais; (2) it took the FBI a year to conclude round one of its investigation, which was based on its review of 55,000 emails; (3) Comey had promised to get back to congress should more info arise, and when 650,000 unexpected emails showed up, he made good on his word by letting congress know; and (4) the FBI terminated its investigation LONG before reviewing 650,000 emails. I once reviewed 250,000 documents on a case, Based on the foregoing, SOMEONE got to Comey〞somewhere along the line. For all I know, though, the whole thing was scripted from start to finish, and Comey read his script at every point along the way, even when it physically disgusted him in round one. So while you might be right about the time, I think if the Deep State made a move on Comey, it happened awhile ago. That＊s wholly speculative on my part. You could well be right that they got to him just recently. I just doubt it. I think he＊s the Company Man because he＊s a company man. For DAMN SURE you＊re right about holding Hillary hostage, but she＊s so evil it＊s like throwing a pedophile into a daycare center with no supervision, the shades drawn and the doors locked. \nWith that as the preface, today＊s episode of the Shadow of Truth discussed the latest development in the HRC Crime Family saga:",

    "text": "VIDEOS Hillary ※attack dog§ David Brock plotting with Soros, Steyer, Sussman to ※kick Trump＊s ass§ If there is one thing that is missing from the most scandalous political election in recent history, it is an attempt to physically eliminate the president By Tyler Durden - Friday, November 18, 2016 9:42 AM EST \nThe last time we encountered David Brock , Hillary Clinton＊s so called media ※attack dog§, was two months ago when we exposed a money laundering scheme involving over a dozen of his Pro-Clinton SuperPACs. Now, it appears that unable to concede defeat, the man who aligned his career with Hillary Clinton, is going for blood, and is soliciting the help, but mostly money, of Clinton＊s top donors. \nAccording to Politico , Brock is launching his own Koch-brothers-like donor network to finance attacks on President-elect Donald Trump and to rebuild the political left after Trump＊s stunning victory over Clinton last week. In an email sent out on Thursday night, Brock emailed more than 200 of the biggest donors on the left, including finance titans George Soros, Tom Steyer and Donald Sussman all of whom invested millions of dollars in Clinton＊s campaign with nothing to show for it, inviting them to a private retreat in Palm Beach during inauguration weekend to assess what Democrats did wrong in 2016, figure out how to correct it and raise cash for those initiatives. \n※ This will be THE gathering for Democratic donors from across the country to hear from a broad and diverse group of leaders about the next steps for progressives under a Trump Administration ,§ Brock wrote to the donors in an email. ※What better way to spend inaugural weekend than talking about how to kick Donald Trump＊s ass?§ Brock said. The retreat, which is planned as the first in a series of regular gatherings, will feature appearances by an array of Democratic elected officials, operatives and liberal thinkers and group officials, Brock explained in an interview. \nWhile it is unclear how many of the addressed billionaires confirmed their presence at this ※secret§ gathering, Brock predicted there would be significant interest, noting that the keynote address at his last major donor conference, back in 2013, was delivered by former President Bill Clinton. It is unclear how much Clinton received for one hours of his time. \nBrock is a self-described ※right-wing hitman-turned-Clinton enforcer § who has used his relationships with some of the left＊s wealthiet supporters and billionaire donors to build an armada of aggressive political outfits that have become pillars of the institutional left and that raised a combined $65 million during the 2016 cycle. As profiled previously, Brock＊s groups include the conservative media monitoring non-profit Media Matters, the opposition research super PAC American Bridge and the legal watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \nThat＊s not all: other groups in his network include the liberal media-funding vehicle American Independent Institute, the media-training non-profit Franklin Forum and the for-profit social media operation ShareBlue, which The New York Times described as ※Hillary Clinton＊s Outrage Machine.§ A seventh group, a super PAC called Correct the Record that was created to coordinate directly with Clinton＊s campaign , is winding down, though Brock said that a number of its functions and personnel likely will be absorbed by his other groups. \nAnd yet one wonders if Brock＊s attempt to square things up with Trump isn＊t too little, too late, especially for a many who like Huma Abedin, has been so closely associated with Hillary and her now defunct political career: Brock acknowledged in the interview: ※There is no question that we poured our heart and soul into this election for Hillary, but these institutions were built before her campaign and were intended to outlast it.§ \nTo separate himself from the Clintons whom he serves so well over the years, Brock said in his email to donors that he created Media Matters more than a decade ago to help the left push back during George W. Bush＊s presidency. \n※In 2005, we were part of a successful progressive effort to regroup, retool and recover,§ he wrote. ※While today＊s situation is more dire, media matters more than ever.§ \nBut the biggest problem for Brock is that he is likely stepping on the very toes of those whose money he is after: as Politico notes, the Palm Beach retreat seems to be a challenge to the 12-year-old Democracy Alliance, a club of liberal financiers that was started by Soros and a handful of other major donors to fund the institutional left . In fact, the club, which held its annual winter meeting this week in Washington, helped launch Media Matters, and many of Brock＊s donors belong to its ranks. Brock said he＊s inviting the president of the DA, as the club is known, to his Palm Beach retreat. \nThere is one way Brock＊s network hopes to differentiate itself: while the Democracy Alliance at its winter meeting discussed ways to push back on the Trump administration, many of the group＊s members have tried to train its focus on pressuring Democrats from the left on issues like fighting climate change, money in politics and drug laws; Brock however is more overtly and aggressively political, and has been ※largely agnostic on the philosophical divisions with which Democrats are grappling.§ \n※We don＊t think of this as representing a faction of the Democratic Party, but a cross-section of it, so we＊re not going to precook things ideologically,§ he said. ※It is very politically minded, and there is an urgency to it.§ \nAt this point two questions emerge: one of the main reasons why Clinton lost is precisely due to behind the scenes scheming such as this, where political ※attack dog§ operatives would meet with billionaires and strategize how to shift public perception on any number of items. That has now been proven to be a losing strategy. Have the democrats truly not learned anything from their most shocking failure in history? \nThe next question is just how much more ※overtly and aggressively political§ will Brock, whose organizations have been alleged to be behind a number of the anti-Trump riots in recent months, be in his quest to take down, or rather ※kick the ass§ of Donald Trump. Because if there is one thing that is so far missing from the most scandalous political election in recent history, it is an attempt to physically eliminate the president. We can only hope that the ※hitman-turned-Clinton enforcer§ will not decide to go that far.",

The Weiner email bomb dropped in the middle of this. As it turns out, the Weiner lap-top mishap appears to a ※Black Swan§ of sorts that eluded Hillary＊s tentacles of control. In the piece below, Stewart presents useful background knowledge and intellectual tools with which to help you analyze and interpret the next sequence of events before and after the election (assuming the election is not postponed). \nThe information that emerges from the Weiner laptop is going to blow people＊s minds 每 John Titus, Best Evidence Productions, in an upcoming Shadow of Truth \nAuthor＊s Preface: We are far more interested in markets than politics. To us, free markets represent liberty in motion. But today, politics, and particularly the most corrupt political institution on earth, the Federal Reserve, have markets in a hammer-lock. At this point, we have to understand what is happening in politics in order to understand what is likely to happen in markets. We write a great deal about politics at this critical juncture in order to help you understand markets and achieve the financial freedom you desire and deserve. \nRegarding the breaking Clinton-scandal developments, we believe that in addition to the 650,000 emails retrieved from the Abedin / Weiner computer which are going to show a level of corruption in this nation never before even imagined let alone proved, the FBI＊s decision to re-open the investigation was related to the Bundy acquittals on October 27, 2016. We believe that government officials are looking up the barrel of a full-blown American revolution. Not the shooting kind, but rather something much worse for them: complete moral rejection of government and Establishment corruption by the PRODUCTIVE CLASS in America, which threatens to rapidly spread into and cripple the American economy just ahead of the holiday selling season. \nThe National Retail Federation has just reported that 25% of shoppers are waiting for the election outcome prior to deciding how much they are going to spend during the holidays, something the NRF has never seen before. If principled, productive people feel that this election was stolen from them by Clinton and Establishment corruption, they are going to shut down. They are going to WITHDRAW THEIR FINANCIAL CONSENT from a rigged, dirty system that is looting them and destroying their futures. While the government can effectively deal with many kinds of protest, it cannot even begin to deal with a general economic boycott by the productive class, even if it is just at the margin. (All profits are at the margin.) The consequences of such a boycott upon general business activity; tax receipts at all levels from municipal to federal; the stock and bond markets; and the national mood, with its extraordinarily complex and critical interconnections and ramifications would be monumental, and perhaps beyond all American precedent. \nDespite a multi-million dollar, taxpayer-funded Federal legal onslaught in the case against the Bundy＊s and their co-defendants, the jurors re-confirmed something communicated throughout history. Namely, that while there are a very few things that universally disgust human beings, one of them is bullies. The people are not pleased, and the Establishment knows it is in trouble. Now on to our article.] \nThe Clinton Syndrome Curse: A Clinton 每 Obama Co-Presidency. (The Clinton Syndrome: Part 2) \nIn Part 1, we defined the Clinton Syndrome as a psychological condition in which voters develop a favorable attitude toward a political predator who deceives, disdains, swindles and abuses them. It is a variant of the Stockholm Syndrome, but much larger in scope and scale, as demonstrated by the fact that tens of millions of American voters currently exhibit the pathological condition. This Syndrome was identified by Inferential Analytics (IA), an accurate and reliable forecasting method we have developed and use. You can read a detailed explanation of the syndrome in our first article on the subject: ※The Clinton Syndrome: The Establishment＊s Weapon for National Conquest (Part 1)§ LINK \nIn this article, Part 2, we delve deeper into what the 2016 presidential election is really all about, and outline the consequences that will occur should the Clinton Syndrome prevail on November 8 th . The Clinton Syndrome has resulted in a potentially deadly national disease which will wreak havoc if it spreads out of control at this time. \nWe regard as an existential threat to the United States the fact that tens of millions of American voters have no idea how deeply fraudulent the entire 2016 presidential campaign has been, from the very beginning. If Donald Trump had not appeared out of nowhere, this would never have been an election at all, but rather an orchestrated, planned enablement of the Clintons and their Establishment handlers to engage in unprecedented corruption, regime change and outright plunder. \nIf successful, this still-active effort to fraudulently inject the Clintons into the power seat will become a multi-trillion dollar gift to the Establishment elite who know exactly how to profit from Clinton graft and corruption; will destroy what is left of the American economy, which simply cannot sustain four more years of intense looting and fraud; and will result in the outright overthrow of the American form of governance by a deadly new political system that we call ※crony communism (outlined in our article: Crony Communism: Hillary Clinton＊s Game Plan for America. LINK \nThe people have been so confused and deceived by the multi-billion dollar avalanche of deliberately concocted lies and propaganda about this election that they don＊t even know who is running for President on the Democrat ticket. \nHillary Clinton has both a co-presidential and a vice presidential running mate, neither of which is Tim Kaine, a corrupt political suck-up and hack who was selected precisely because he will do exactly what he is told, not matter how criminal or immoral. \nClinton＊s co-presidential running mate is Barack Hussein Obama; her vice-presidential candidate is the United Nations. This is the Establishment＊s Dream Team, cooked up to make the fastest possible progress toward their crony-communist and globalist overthrow of the United States. The Establishment realizes that the people are waking up fast to what is being done to them and their country. Therefore, they have put their corrupt machinations into high gear in order to beat the clock, which is ticking loudly. \nWhen people say that a vote for Clinton means four more years of Obama, they have their arithmetic wrong. A Clinton victory means eight more years of Obama in the next four, and a total knock-out for the nation. \nThe Mainstream Media＊s (MSM) deliberately false narrative is that Obama has been campaigning non-stop for Clinton because he wants to protect his ※legacy,§ and believes that Clinton will do this for him. \nThis is yet another of the ※Big Lie§ mind bombs that have been dropped onto the American people＊s heads during this colossally fraudulent, dishonest and propagandistic Establishment onslaught to get Clinton elected. \nThis narrative is meant to suggest that Barrack Obama wants to retire, and then ride out the rest of his life looking upon his ※legacy.§ \nThere are two problems with this story. First, Obama＊s legacy is already blowing up in his and the entire nation＊s face, so there is nothing Clinton will be able to do to salvage it. Obamacare and the Iran Deal are just two examples among dozens of the collapse of Obama＊s so-called legacy, which would much better be called a national damnation. \nThe second problem is that Obama is only 55 years old and has not given even ONE indication our model can detect that he actually wants or intends to retire. (Soros, one of his champions, is 86 years old and still wreaking havoc worldwide. These people never stop until the Reaper drops in.) In fact, what we see in Obama is the exact opposite: he demonstrates a strong desire not only to remain on the political stage, but to assume a larger presence upon it. \nSpeaking at a rally in Philadelphia on September 13, 2016 (while Hillary was at home recovering from ※pneumonia§), Obama said, ※It＊s good to be back on the campaign trail.§ He then said, ※I really, really, REALLY want to elect Hillary Clinton.§ (Please carefully consider that sentence, because it is a textbook example (although just one of hundreds over the years) of Obama＊s pathological Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). He did not say, ※I really, really, REALLY want YOU [the people to whom he was speaking] to elect Hillary Clinton,§ but rather, ※I really, really, REALLY want to elect Hillary Clinton,§ making the people＊s national election all about himself. Comments such as this are extraordinarily important to our analysis, and their significance has been borne out time and again over our 15+ years of doing this work. Paradoxically, the smallest factors often have the greatest implications. \nLater in the same speech, Obama boasted (our comments added within brackets): ※More Americans are working [in part time, minimum wage jobs], more have [100% subsidized] health care, incomes are rising [for the establishment elite], poverty is falling [according to false, politically doctored numbers] and gas is $2.00 a gallon. Thanks, Obama!!!§ In Obama＊s narcissistically crippled mind, the entire United States economy is a function of one thing and one thing only: him. Narcissists in positions of power are extremely destructive (e.g. Obamacare), because they are completely out of touch with what is happening in the real, as opposed their self-flattering fantasy world. In any event, this kind of campaign bragging, swagger and grandiosity is not indicative of someone who plans to retire from politics in the next few weeks. \nObama＊s clear desire to remain in the game makes him valuable to Clinton, while also making Clinton valuable to him. Intersecting motives are where deals get done. And a Clinton 每 Obama collaboration would be ideal for the Establishment. Obama has been the gift that keeps on giving to the elite, as they have raked in trillions from his presidency. They want as much of Obama as they can get, because he is a money machine. (For example, witness Obama＊s continuing efforts to ram the TPP, an Establishment fraud against the people, down the nation＊s throat. Obama does whatever the Establishment tells him to do, in the full knowledge his ※Library§ Slush Fund will be richly rewarded for his efforts, just as the Clinton Slush Fund has been enriched by more than $1.8 billion, with a ※b,§ for the Clinton sell-out of people to the elite.) \nObama is the most internationally-traveled president in the nation＊s history, having made 51 international trips to 56 different countries during his two terms in office. It is as if he has been running for international office, and now we can see that he has been. His globetrotting has required strength, stamina and energy, the exact physical attributes that Clinton, who has been pictured requiring assistance to climb a short set of stairs, lacks. Given her health issues, Clinton cannot possibly perform on a global stage going forward; she will be lucky to successfully navigate the White House. \nThis presents a problem. For the Establishment agenda to be fully executed, Clinton needs international support, and ideally, that international mandates be imposed upon the United States. But she will not be capable of traveling internationally to seal the deals that must get done. \nThis is where Obama comes in. While he would never step ※backwards§ into a role such as, for example, Secretary of State (an ego-wounding demotion), his passion for continued political involvement would find an excellent home at the United Nations. \nIn this Inferential Analytics scenario, Hillary Clinton will get Obama placed in a high level United Nations position. The United States pays for roughly 25% of total United Nations annual budget, far more than any other nation, and still has clout even though more and more countries are turning their backs on America. \nOther nations would support the idea of a senior role for Obama if it were made clear to them that his mission would be to continue the ※fundamental transformation§ of the United States that he promised during his 2008 campaign and has been conducting ever since. This ※transformation§ has done extreme damage to the United States, and while it has been a disaster for America, it has been good for the rest of the world. Finally, they see a means by which to bring the United States to heel. The idea of the further weakening of the United States will sound to them like a very good deal. The one assurance they will seek is that in exchange for giving Obama an important role at the U.N., Obama will get Clinton to agree not to incinerate the northern hemisphere in a nuclear war, at least not until they have finalized their preparations for it. \nA Clinton 每 Obama co-presidency will be a double body-blow to the nation, with Clinton turning it into a corrupt, crony-communist Establishment lootocracy from within, and Obama destroying it from without. \nLeveraging the United Nations, Clinton and Obama can effect two personal agendas they have long sought: gun control, and a multi-million person ※open borders§ invasion of America. The first agenda will disarm the people, which has been Job #1 in every communist takeover in history; the second will ensure that the ※Last American Presidential Election§ occurs on November 8, 2016. In the future, presidents and all other politicians and government agency heads will be appointed by the Establishment, exactly as happens in communist regimes. While there might be ※show elections,§ the outcomes will have been pre-determined at every level far in advance. \nA Clinton 每 Obama co-presidency will also ensure that other Establishment objectives are met. These include the institution of carbon taxes (an enormous and unprecedented new revenue source and looting opportunity); the passage of the TPP (an Establishment bonanza); and the maximum-possible imposition of the New World Order regime change agenda upon the nations and their people. \nWhile Obama could advance the Establishment＊s aims in virtually any high level position at the U.N., a role that would make him particularly deadly at the outset would be Co-chair of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), joining current head Filippo Grandhi. \nObama could make his appointment a matter of smooth sailing by stating his belief that the United States is a large, wealthy, relatively under-populated nation that could rapidly absorb a large number of immigrants. By promising to tap into the country＊s private wealth, Obama could warrant that all new immigrants would be fully covered by the country＊s comprehensive welfare system upon arrival, which is exactly what happens today. This idea would be intoxicating to the new Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, who was the former head of the UNHCR and is an avowed socialist. \nThe United Nations currently reports the existence of more than 60,000,000 displaced persons and refugees in the world. If the United States pledged to take in, say, 5,000,000 of them, senior U.N. officials would be delighted. What would they have to lose? Dealing with the integration and cost issues would be America＊s problem, not theirs. The U.N. could pass a resolution, written by Obama in such a way as to make it convertible into an Executive Order by Clinton, mandating the acceptance of these refugees by the United States. Clinton would put up her hands and say, ※I didn＊t do it. The U.N. did it, and we must do our ※fair share,§ while also complying with international law and being decent and responsible international citizens.§ \nAs we have pointed out in the past, the United States government is irredeemably bankrupt by any accounting definition one wishes to use. With $20,000,000,000,000.00 in on-the-books debt, another $10,000,000,000,000.00 in debt projected to be added over the next decade (it will be far greater than this, given current trends), and at the very minimum another $120,000,000,000,000.00 in unfunded debt and contingent liabilities, there is absolutely no way the government can ever pay its obligations. So you might wonder, how could the government possibly pay for an immigrant invasion of this magnitude? \nThe answer is, the government won＊t pay for it; the people will. This is what crony communism is all about. It is estimated that today, there is roughly $70 trillion in private wealth in America. Assuming that half of it, or $35 trillion belongs to the cronies and is off-limits, this leaves $35 trillion that is available for expropriation and looting. While this is certainly not enough to fix America＊s fiscal problems, not even close, it could fund 4 years＊ worth of radical fiscal adventurism as well as crony communism regime change. \nAs Hillary Clinton has repeatedly said during this campaign, ※We are going to go where the money is,§ and if you don＊t take that statement seriously, we believe you are making a very big mistake. She and top colleagues such as Sanders and Warren have said in plain English, at a high decibel level that they are coming for your money, and they are, because in their minds, you don＊t deserve to have any. Just as Obama once famously said, in a rare, honest, off-script, non-tele-prompted moment, ※If you have a business, you didn＊t build that,§ he and his fellow crony communists also believe, ※If you have saved some after-tax money, you don＊t deserve to have that.§ To them, any savings you possess represent funds the government should have gotten its hands in the first tax cycle, but didn＊t. They intend to rectify that error going forward. \nWe have outlined this theme to demonstrate that this election is about an agenda that very few people understand, because it has deliberately been withheld from them. In actuality, the voters have no idea what Clinton truly stands for, or what the Establishment agenda, which she fully believes in and will implement, really is. The stakes in this election are therefore greater than those of any other election in our nation＊s history, in our view. This is why the Establishment has spent billions of dollars rigging it. They intend to collect trillions in plunder on the other side, but they can only do so if it goes their way. As we have already seen, they will stop at nothing to get what they want. \nSome Implications of a Clinton 每 Obama Co-presidency: \nHere is a snapshot of the forecast generated by IA in the event of a Clinton 每 Obama victory: The Clinton 每 Obama Co-presidential regime will be the most secretive and non-transparent presidency in U.S. history. Clinton will become invisible, just as she often has during the campaign, not just for health reasons, but because she will turn her back on everyday citizens, whom she disdains, once she gets the prize she has sought her entire life. Obama will make secret deals all over the world (think of the secret Iran cash payments and deal, and his behind-the-scenes agitating for TPP, but on a much larger scale, as illustrations). Every one of these deals will be a dagger in the nation＊s back. The American people will never again know the truth about what actually goes on behind government doors, or about the corruption that infects the entire political and establishment system. The political class will never again allow itself to suffer Wikileaks-like exposure. Politics will shift to a CIA-like ※need to know§ model, where information is doled out selectively and in piece-parts. Only a very few at the top will know the overall agenda, and the full set of tactics being employed to achieve it. Anyone who compromises or exposes the system will simply be executed. (Seth Rich comes to mind.) Going forward, the people will know absolutely nothing about what is really happening in Washington, D.C., or about the D.C. / Wall Street and Establishment initiatives. Orwell＊s prophecy, ※1984,§ which is already quite real, will become even more so. The United States will experience an accelerating Brain Drain. Forward-thinking people will realize that America＊s slide into predatory crony-communism can and will never be reversed, and that it will be impossible for them and their loved ones to get ahead in such a corrupt, suffocating environment. (Imagine being scolded, lectured, insulted and talked down to on a regular basis by people like Clinton, Obama and Warren, because that is exactly what will happen.) Progressive countries will put out the welcome mat for hard-working, principled, skilled, entrepreneurial Americans. No one will want America＊s whining, lazy, non-productive, ※entitled§ mooches. That＊s just a fact. Virtually every nation anyone would actually want to move to for a better opportunity grades potential immigrants according to age, education, language proficiency, skills and likelihood to be productive. Prospects are disqualified if they do not earn a sufficient score. No sensible nation on earth wants to bring in do-nothings whose only capability is to leech off its producers. Productive Americans who remain in the country for their own reasons will quietly adopt a John Galt mindset, sidestepping the corruption and crony communist expropriation by shutting down, dropping out and fading off the radar screen. This will result in an immediate slow-down of business activity, which will ultimately lead to economic collapse. Given that all profits are at the margin, relatively small percentage declines in sales can entirely wipe out income. The John Galt effect will result in the collapse of the nation＊s many Ponzi schemes, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, pensions (government and private) and the biggest one of all, Government Debt. These schemes simply cannot be maintained in a dramatically slowing business environment, no matter how much private wealth is looted. Government will take draconian steps to shut down all non-government-sanctioned news and information outlets. Their prime target will be the Alternative Media, which will only be further empowered, and embraced by the people. A powerful Resistance movement will spread like wildfire. Nonetheless, people should fill their minds with as much truth as they possibly can right now, because it will become much harder and more expensive to find in the future. Today＊s Alternative Media is the greatest gift any people in history have ever received, and people should leverage it as best they can while they can. A steady retreat by government officials and establishment elitists to their multi-trillions of dollars＊ worth of taxpayer-funded bunkers will occur, as they seek to hide from the American people, who will be waking up by the additional tens of thousands every day. A Federal Reserve December rate hike has a 0% chance of happening if Clinton is elected; there is a 100% chance of a rate hike if Trump is elected. The Fed is a totally political organization, and they will do everything they can to punish the voters and scorch the economic earth if the people choose Trump over the Establishment agenda the Fed has been 100% behind. If Clinton wins, people will IMMEDIATELY be bombarded with MSM reports about the implications of the 2016 election upon the 2018 mid-term and 2020 general elections. This will be part of a full-scale effort to inject mass quantities of Hopium into the Trump supporters＊ brains, and get them to focus not upon the rigged election of 2016, but on the ※next§ election where, they will falsely be told, their vote will ※really count!§ In the meantime, the Establishment will be doing everything necessary to ensure that the 2018 and 2020 ※elections§ are completely rigged, fraudulent and meaningless. A massive move into real money will begin, and this will be the subject of our next article. There are developments in this sphere that you must know about, and one of the most important Inferential Analytics themes we have ever examined was triggered on October 27, 2016. We will have a full description in the next week or so. \nIn conclusion, the 2016 election is an existential event for the United States. W believe that the situation is becoming so unstable that you have little time to do everything you can to prepare, and get your personal houses in order. We are writing to help as best we can, while we can. \nStewart Dougherty \nStewart Dougherty is the creator of Inferential Analytics, a forecasting method that applies to events proprietary, time-tested principles of human instinct, desire and action.

F#%k me Dave, I feel like I＊m on LSD. 每 email from a reader \nAbout 12 years ago I was chatting with the friend who dragged me feet-first into the ※dark side§ and the world of precious metals in 2001. We were discussing Eastman Kodak＊s likely demise a few years before the Company went into the tank. We knew a 2008-type event was going to happen at some point.

Mind you, this was a couple years after Enron, 9/11 (which we knew was a Government false-flag operation), Bernie Madoff and the U.S.＊ illegal invasion based on admitted (eventually) lies propagated by Colin Powell. \nI have to say, the way in which Hillary Clinton＊s criminal organization has gained complete control over the political and justice system and the media in this country is truly mind-blowing. Hillary is a criminally insane sociopath. That point is unequivocally inarguable.

One highly plausible is that operatives in the Deep State shut down the FBI investigation in order to preserve the treasure trove of material that will give it power over Clinton＊s Presidency. The SoT was perplexed by this, so we asked John Titus his take on this. His answer was quite compelling: Here＊s what I＊m reasonably sure of, based on experience. (1) Jim Comey looked sick when, at the conclusion of round one, and having proven beyond all doubt that Hillary violateed 18 U.S.C 793(f), he said no reasonable prosecutor would charge her. He wasn＊t acting. Bad acting comes right through camera lens, and that man looked like he was about to vomit when he left that dais; (2) it took the FBI a year to conclude round one of its investigation, which was based on its review of 55,000 emails; (3) Comey had promised to get back to congress should more info arise, and when 650,000 unexpected emails showed up, he made good on his word by letting congress know; and (4) the FBI terminated its investigation LONG before reviewing 650,000 emails. I once reviewed 250,000 documents on a case, Based on the foregoing, SOMEONE got to Comey〞somewhere along the line. For all I know, though, the whole thing was scripted from start to finish, and Comey read his script at every point along the way, even when it physically disgusted him in round one. So while you might be right about the time, I think if the Deep State made a move on Comey, it happened awhile ago. That＊s wholly speculative on my part. You could well be right that they got to him just recently. I just doubt it. I think he＊s the Company Man because he＊s a company man. For DAMN SURE you＊re right about holding Hillary hostage, but she＊s so evil it＊s like throwing a pedophile into a daycare center with no supervision, the shades drawn and the doors locked. \nWith that as the preface, today＊s episode of the Shadow of Truth discussed the latest development in the HRC Crime Family saga: Share this:",

    "text": "U.S. Economy Clinton Foundation , new world order , Trump admin Tyranny is defined as that which is legal for the Government but illegal for the citizenry 每 Thomas Jefferson \nThe mainstream media tried it＊s hardest to persuade the public that Hillary was a lock to win the election. Even the nefarious George Soros asserted confidently that Trump might win the popular election but Hillary would win the Electoral College. \nBut apparently the voters just weren＊t ready for a tyrannical President yet. The perception of the two candidates shaped by the mainstream media led the unsuspecting 每 if not comatose 每 public to believe that Hillary Clinton was some liberal angel who would save the country from reality and that Trump is some kind of fascist monster who is going to force everyone with slightly tinted skin to leave the country. \nOf course, nothing could be farther from the truth. Lost in the shuffle is the fact that the Dragon Lady, reincarnated, hid behind the veil of the tax-free status of the Clinton Foundation to steal $100＊s of millions from the taxpayers and the Saudi royal family (the Huma Abedin connection, which is why she is Hillary＊s ※Igor§) and move it into the bank accounts of the Clinton family and friends of the Clinton family. The taxpayers got nothing in return 每 the Saudi family got use of the U.S. military to attack Syria. \nPhony polls are just another form of insidious propaganda 每 it＊s a tool designed to persuade the masses to go the direction of the poll and discourage the other side from voting. It worked for Hitlery and the DNC against Bernie in California. But the people woke up enough to see through the ruse in the big election. \nThe election results on Tuesday were not about giving Trump or the Republican Party a political and economic policy mandate. The only mandate issued on Tuesday 每 quite loud and clear 每 was this: ※Someone please stop Washington DC and Wall Street from date-raping us in the bodily area where waste exits.§ That was it. Obama had the same mandate in 2008 and completely betrayed his supporters. \nJudging from the early indications from the Trump camp regarding Trump＊s likely cabinet and advisor appointments, it＊s going to be out with the old and in with the old. Currently it appears as if the new Attorney General will be Rudy Guiliani, who is a blatant Establishment hack; Larry Kudlow as an advisor, who is the worst economist in modern era; and Jamie Dimon, CEO, JP Morgan/Chase 每 who should be in jail 每 and Goldman Sachs alumnus Steven Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary. More of the same. Neocon elitists, Establishment apologists and Wall Street thieves. \nThe Shadow of Truth hosted special guest, Eric Dubin of The News Doctors to review and dissect what happened on Tuesday evening. Unfortunately, it＊s not difficult to conclude that not much will change when Obama hands the Oval Office wand to Trump: Share this:",

    "title": "Let＊s Be Clear 每 A Vote For Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For World War 3",
    "text": "Let＊s Be Clear 每 A Vote For Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For World War 3   \nBy Michael Snyder \nIf you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as ※dangerous§ and ※temperamental§, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. \nSomeone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are ※going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton§＃ \nOn Syria＊s civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. \nClinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ※safe zones§ on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. \n※What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,§ said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. ※You＊re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.§ \nIn order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. \nAnd in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. \nAccording to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences＃ \nRussia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. \n※I wouldn＊t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,§ Clapper said, speaking with CBS＊ Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. \nOf course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria ※would require us to go to war§ ＃ \n※Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,＃ That＊s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I＊m not going to make.§ ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) \nBut Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. \nYou see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn＊t for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no ※humanitarian crisis§ in Syria at all. \nThanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won＊t have anywhere to hide. \nSo the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. \nOne recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates ＃ \n※Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation 每 at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,§ Putin said. \n※Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,§ Putin noted. \nAnyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. \nAnd even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania ＃ Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America＊s troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. \nIn addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia＃ \nAfter accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. \nA rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. \n※The US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,§ said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen S?reide. \nMost Americans aren＊t aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. \nBut in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation ＃ \nRussian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. \nAt the Kremlin＊s Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. \nThe country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. \nI know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. \nIn my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn＊t know how the election would turn out. \nAt this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. \nIf you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don＊t do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. \nIf the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years.",

    "text": "〞 Susan? (@GaetaSusan) October 27, 2016 WikiLeaks: Former State Dept. Official Coordinated with Team Clinton on Uranium One Scandal Pushback One month before former State Department official Jose Fernandez defended then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton＊s decision to sign off on the transfer of 20 percent of U.S. uranium to Russia, Fernandez told John Podesta that he was eager to ※do all I can to support Secretary Clinton,§ according to purported emails uncovered by WikiLeaks. On March 30, 2015 〞 weeks before the explosive book Clinton Cash was released, and nearly a month before the New York Times published a 4,000 word story detailing the Uranium One transaction that multiple donors to the Clinton Foundation made millions from 〞 Jose Fernandez wrote an email to Podesta in hopes that the pair could meet. \nOn April 17, Fernandez writes to Podesta, again, thanking him for their meeting and said, ※I would like to do all I can to support Secretary Clinton, and would welcome your advice and help in steering me to the right persons in the campaign.§ \nhttp://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/26/wikileaks-former-state-dept-official-coordinated-with-team-clinton-on-uranium-one-scandal-pushback/ If The Media Investigated Hillary Like They Did Watergate, We Wouldn＊t Need WikiLeaks Today, mainstream publications have become willing accomplices in suppressing the same type of information they worked so tenaciously to expose all those years ago. \nIt has now been more than four decades since the Washington Post and New York Times led the charge to bring down Richard Nixon and his administration＊s massive web of corruption and political subterfuge schemes. They did so by aggressively and tirelessly seeking out the truth, and reporting back to the American people clearly and comprehensively. \nToday, both publications have become willing accomplices in suppressing the same type of information they worked so tenaciously to expose all those years ago. By openly and unapologetically acting as institutional surrogates for the Clinton campaign, these same institutions, and nearly every other mainstream media outlet in America, have gone hands-off in exposing what may very well turn out to be the most explosive and damaging corruption scandal in American politics since ※Tricky Dick§ was reelected back in ＊72. \nNot by coincidence, Julian Assange and WikiLeaks have stepped in to fill the void. And boy, are the ※truth seekers§ mad about that! My, How Times Have Changed \nOn June 17, 1972, five men were arrested for breaking and entering the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, both reporters for the Washington Post at the time, unflinchingly pursued the complete truth behind the break-in. Little did they know that summer how vast was the network of lies and corruption their investigation would eventually uncover. \nThe editors at the Post initially put the story on the back burner, while the Nixon administration deftly stonewalled the reporters＊ probes. By September, though, the Post and New York Times were fully on board with the investigation, and the administration had gone into full cover-up mode. Even though the FBI had confirmed that the administration had conducted a political sabotage conspiracy, it was not enough to keep Nixon from being reelected in a landslide in November. But the die was cast. The American press made it clear this story would not end until all the facts were in and Nixon and his henchmen were fully exposed. \nFast-forward to 2016. We are now two weeks away from the general election, and once again a potentially devastating story appears to be developing, related to a web of corruption and deceit that could eventually rival the Watergate scandal. Just like 1972, the Post and the Times are fully engaged. Except this time, the ※two lions of journalism§ have little interest in covering the avalanche of revelations pouring forth against the Clinton campaign. Instead, both publications are working around the clock to bring the Democratic nominee to power. That＊s not all. Nearly every other mainstream media outlet in the country has jumped on the bandwagon. \nIt would be incorrect to think that until now the mainstream media has been a relatively objective source for news. This has been going on for a long time. Few could argue that back in the ＊70s, editors Ben Bradlee at the Post and Abe Rosenthal at the Times were not absolutely salivating at the chance to bring Nixon down. But they achieved this objective in relentless pursuit of the facts, not the willing suppression of the same. \nOne would think, given the self-inflicted meltdown the Donald Trump camp finds itself in right now, the media might at least feign some level of balanced reporting, but they＊ve made it very clear they＊re not taking any chances. They＊re going to keep digging dirt on Trump, and they＊re going to continue to minimize, to the best of their ability, a story that may well have historic and damaging implications, both for the nation as a whole and our entire political system moving forward. \nAlthough this may prove to be a very successful political tactic for this year＊s presidential election, it is likely to forever damage the reputation of mainstream American journalism, and it most certainly will continue to encourage the American public to look elsewhere for the unvarnished truth.

I can＊t speak for south Florida , but as a longtime resident of north Florida I can promise you that there is a near frenzy of support for Donald Trump here. Over the past year I have seen endless amounts of Trump signs, stickers and banners. I saw a fair amount of pro-Bernie stuff as well. But pro-Hillary advertising? It＊s practically non-existent, I haven＊t even seen half a dozen stickers and absolutely zero lawn signs. So I find it astonishing when I turn on the ※news§ and hear the libs talking about Hillary＊s double-digit lead over Trump. It＊s not true, don＊t believe it. Donald Trump is doing great and is on track to win the White House in just under two weeks. The Republican presidential nominee has 45 percent to Democrat Hillary Clinton＊s 43 percent among likely voters when third-party candidates are included, the poll found . In a hypothetical two-way race, Trump has 46 percent to Clinton＊s 45 percent. DONALD TRUMP RALLY IN SAINT AUGUSTINE DRAWS TENS OF THOUSANDS: \nWith over 4,000 people already inside the Saint Augustine Amphitheater, I took 60 seconds to do a walk-thru of just a fraction of the thousands of people in the overflow section who stood there for hours waiting to see Donald Trump. This is the type of support Trump has here in Florida. Among independents , Trump gets 43 percent to Clinton＊s 41 percent in a head-to-head contest. When third-party candidates are included, Trump picks up 1 point with independents while Clinton drops to 37 percent, with Libertarian Gary Johnson taking 9 percent and the Green Party＊s Jill Stein getting 5 percent. ※This race may come down to the independent vote,§ said pollster J. Ann Selzer, who oversaw the survey. ※ Right now, they tilt for Trump . By a narrow margin, they opted for Obama over Romney in 2012.§ Trump＊s showing in this poll is stronger than in other recent surveys in the state. Trump is also surging ahead of HIllary in Ohio and and is rapidly closing the gap in Pennsylvania. CNN ANCHOR＊S STUNNED WHEN FACT CHECKER CONFIRMS HILLARY＊S CORRUPTION:",

    "text": "With more than 50 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents assigned to investigate Hillary Clinton＊s criminal use of a private email server, how did she avoid charges? \nNow, the smoking gun has emerged. \nVirginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton insider and former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman, steered at least $675,000 to the election of the wife of an FBI official involved in the Clinton probe. McAuliffe＊s political action committee gave $467,500 to the state senate campaign for FBI agent Andrew McCabe＊s wife. He is now the deputy director of the FBI. \nMore money came to her through the Democratic Party of Virginia : \nJill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, the report states, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe. \nThe money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate＊s husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the FBI. \nWithin a year, McCabe was promoted to deputy director, the second-highest position in the bureau.[＃] \nThe governor＊s office claimed the FBI＊s McCabe met the governor only once 〞 on March 7, 2015, when McAuliffe persuaded Jill McCabe to run. \nThe 2015 Virginia state Senate run 〞 her first run for public office 〞 was unsuccessful as she lost to the incumbent Republican. \nMcAuliffe ※supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator.

The former president＊s Secret Service detail nicknamed the mistress ※Energizer§ because of the way Bill always ※perked up§ and seemed revitalized after her visits. Julie McMahon has been outed by the press as Bill Clinton＊s ※Energizer,§ a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Energizer Bunny. This mother of three and socialite has publicly denied being one of Clinton＊s lovers, but a plethora of purported evidence is now unfolding online in an effort to refute McMahon＊s claims of innocence, as per Bizpac Review . McMahon reportedly lives just a few minutes away from Bill and Hillary Clinton＊s home in New York, which is called Whitehaven. If the Clintons were Republicans, the liberal mainstream media would be calling them racists over the chosen name of their luxurious estate. Always, Julia McMahon would arrive at Whitehaven via SUV. She would only stay a few hours sometimes, but other times she would spend an entire week at the Clinton residence. Julia McMahon reportedly met both Bill and Hillary in 1998 when he was president. Although the Clinton campaign has tried to label McMahon a friend to both of the Clintons, she only visited or spent the night at the house when Hillary wasn＊t home, the Daily Mail reports. Sometimes, McMahon allegedly arrived just mere minutes after the departure of the former first lady. The Secret Service agents on the Clinton Whitehaven detail were reportedly not ever privy to the woman＊s name, but they were allegedly under strict orders not to approach or stop her when she arrived. Every member of a president＊s family is protected by a Secret Service detail. The Secret Service reportedly uses the same letter to assign a codename to protectees. Bill Clinton＊s Secret Service name is reportedly ※Eagle§ and Hillary＊s is ※Evergreen.§ The Secret Service may have run out of ※E§ codenames over the years thanks to all of Bill＊s lady friends.

Hardy, an attorney and Waco expert writing for The American Thinker . \nThose who remember what happened in Waco will recall that there had been a long and intense standoff between dozens of members of a cult and federal authorities over alleged trafficking and possession of illegal firearms. \nThat standoff ultimately degenerated into an all-out assault on the compound with armored vehicles, heavy weapons and copious amounts of tear gas, eventually starting a massive fire that burned the compound to the ground, killing 74 members of the group, including 21 children. \nThat tragedy has been largely blamed on then-Attorney General Janet Reno, but there is some evidence to suggest that the order to assault the compound came from the Clinton White House, perhaps even from Hillary herself. \nOne piece of evidence that may point to that conclusion is the transcript of the FBI＊s interview with Lisa Foster following the death of her husband Vince, which was ruled a suicide. \nFoster described how troubled",

    "text": "American Thinker October 27, 2016 \nYou＊re probably appalled at the American media＊s shameless whoring for Hillary Clinton, asking yourself why they would so thoroughly debase their much-touted journalistic ethics. President Obama has answered that question. \nAs reported by Agence France Presse, during a recent speech in Pittsburgh he postulated: \n※We are going to have to rebuild within this wild-wild-west-of-information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to. \n※There has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard, because they just don＊t have any basis in anything that＊s actually happening in the world.§ \nSet aside the outrageous, un-American gall in proposing that any central authority should ※curate§ information put out to the public, and walk with me for a minute down a meandering path of speculation. \nIt is, or course, the World Wide Web in which Obama＊s informational ※wild-wild west§ exists. This is the realm of Breitbart, Cybercast News Service, the Drudge Report , World Net Daily , American Thinker , and other non-establishment outlets that persist in making the president uncomfortable. \nAnd what has happened recently to affect the World Wide Web? The U.S. government has handed over control to ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the nonprofit agency that assigns website domain names. \nIs it in the president＊s mind that ICANN might someday assume the ※curating function§ he sees as necessary to insure ※truthiness§ in web-based news reporting? \nWell, according to ICANN Board Chair Stephen D. Crocker, diverse membership in the organization makes such a thing unthinkable. Quoted by the tech site C/NET, Crocker said: \n※This community validated the multistakeholder model of internet governance. It has shown that a governance model defined by the inclusion of all voices, including business, academics, technical experts, civil society, governments and many others is the best way to assure that the internet of tomorrow remains as free, open and accessible as the internet of today.§ \nHis confidence is echoed by the Internet Governance Coalition, a group of technology firms that includes Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Verizon, among others. They issued a statement that lauds ICANN＊s ※strong accountability measures§ and upholds ※the bottom-up approach that embodies the very nature of the open internet we experience today.＃§ \nPardon the skepticism to which I＊ve become increasingly prone, but this sounds very much like the ※collaborative§ concept of governance that prevails in the academic world. \nIf you＊ve ever applied for a position at a college or university, you know that what a search committee wants most urgently to know about you is whether you have a ※collaborative style§ of working. \nWhat exactly is a ※collaborative style,§ as understood in today＊s academic world? It means that you won＊t do anything to contradict the orthodoxy in thought and procedure reigning on campus 〞 in other words, that you are ※politically correct§ in your outlook.",

    "title": "Are Hillary＊s Eyes Cattywampus?",
    "text": "PR Newswire October 27, 2016 \nTUCSON, Ariz. , Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ 〞 Concerns about Hillary Clinton＊s health have been subdued after her three debate performances. She presented her ability to survive 4-and-a-half hours on a stage with Donald Trump as proof of sufficient stamina to serve as commander-in-chief. \n※She evidently intended this as a joke, although I suspect our combat veterans would not be amused,§ states AAPS executive director Jane Orient, M.D. \nVideos are, however, circulating on the internet, from her rather brief and rare appearances in public, which are purported to show pathological eye movements. \n※These are quick, episodic, and inconsistent,§ states Dr. Orient, who is an internist. ※So we decided to ask doctors on our email list to have a look at one of the videos . A helpful tool is to paste the URL into http://RowVid.com and watch it at half or quarter speed.§ \nNearly two-thirds of respondents said they saw abnormal movements. Only 15% did not, and 21% were unsure. There are long segments in which the eye movements appear normal. \nAbout 60% of those who saw abnormal movements thought ※the cause could be a potentially disabling neurological condition,§ and none of them were willing to say that it isn＊t. \nSuch movements signify an abnormality in portions of the brain that coordinate the eye muscles. There is a long differential diagnosis. Possibilities the respondents suggested include increased intracranial pressure (she is at risk for that because of her history of head trauma and a transverse sinus clot); a drug effect; or a chronic degenerative neurological condition. Parkinson＊s disease is mentioned〞with drug treatment concealing most manifestations but causing the eye signs. \nDoctors were asked which tests would be helpful, and 37 responded . The most common one was a full neurological examination by unbiased specialists, including a neuro-ophthalmologist. \n※A neuro-ophthalmologist could do a structured examination, but it might be normal at a moment in time. The video clips need to be explained,§ stated Dr. Orient. ※A cardiologist might do an electrocardiogram that is perfectly normal〞but he will also look at a 24-hour monitor that may show a transient life-threatening rhythm disturbance.§ \nA collection of additional clips in slow motion has been posted. \n※As Hillary revealed to the public, perhaps illegally, the President may have only four minutes to respond to a nuclear threat,§ said Dr. Orient. ※The public needs to know whether she is concealing a serious, progressive illness that may impair memory, reasoning, alertness, or ability to think quickly at a critical time.§ \nThe Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) is a national organization representing physicians in virtually all specialties and every state. Founded in 1943, AAPS has the motto ※omnia pro aegroto,§ which means ※all for the patient.§ \nSOURCE Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) Tags:",

    "title": "Hillary＊s Warped Notion",
    "text": "Chronicles: A Magazine of American Culture October 28, 2016 \nPerhaps one of the most used and abused political expressions in recent years has been that of ※American exceptionalism.§ Politicians and commentators routinely invoke it as a high principle and accuse their opponents of insufficient devotion to it, or contrariwise blame it for all the ills of the world. \nFor example, in 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin ruffled many Americans＊ feathers: \n※It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. . . . We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord＊s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.§ \nHillary Clinton weighed in on exceptionalism in an August speech before the American Legion, in which she also took a swipe at Donald Trump : \nThe United States is an exceptional nation. . . . But, in fact, my opponent in this race has said very clearly that he thinks American exceptionalism is insulting to the rest of the world. In fact, when Vladimir Putin, of all people, criticized American exceptionalism, my opponent agreed with him, saying, and I quote, ＆if you＊re in Russia, you don＊t want to hear that America is exceptional.＊ Well maybe you don＊t want to hear it, but that doesn＊t mean it＊s not true. \nIt needs to be asked, though: when people praise or criticize ※American exceptionalism,§ are they always talking about the same thing? \nAmerica, like any country, has its own distinctive history, culture, and traditions. America＊s unique founding principles〞consent of the governed, due process, a constitutionally limited division of powers, representative government〞justly have been an inspiration to the world for over two centuries. Thomas Jefferson wrote of the ※palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God.§ \nThis ※exceptional§ idea was new in human history. Any American worthy of the name justly takes pride in it. This is the genuine American exceptionalism of Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, lately championed by Reagan. The fact that we have strayed so far from it, both domestically and internationally, is shameful. \nThe unique moral revolution to which the Founding Fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor has little connection to the bastard term (usually capitalized as ※American Exceptionalism§) that describes post-Cold War U.S. global behavior, by which policymakers in Washington assert both an exclusive ※leadership§ privilege and unsupportable obligation to undertake open-ended international missions in the name of the ※Free World§ and the ※international community.§ This is the counterfeit ※Exceptionalism§ of a tiny clique of bipartisan apparatchiki 〞GOP ※neoconservatives§ and Democrat ※liberal interventionists§ and their mainstream media mouthpieces 〞who have little regard for our country＊s oldest traditions or the security and welfare of the American people.

    "title": "21 Things We＊ve Learned About Hillary",
    "text": "October 28, 2016 \nLet＊s talk about Wikileaks. \nFirst of all, the organization was founded by Julian Assange back in 2006. Their website explains what they are all about: \n※WikiLeaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war, spying, and corruption. It has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses.§ \nIn the 11 years that they＊ve been publishing documents, they have not been disproven a single time. Their record for authentication is perfect. (Learn more here and here .) \nSo this means that a person would be pretty silly to disregard anything in the reams of information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, the Clinton Foundation, and the political shenanigans that would put the Machiavellis to shame. \nHere are 21 of the most important things that have come out about Hillary Clinton, that unfortunately, no one is reporting on in the mainstream. In the interest of brevity, each topic has a link to an article that goes deeper into the leak. (In no particular order.) John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign had a nice cozy dinner with Peter Kadzik, one of the top officials in the Department of Justice＃the day after the Benghazi hearing . Kadzik＊s son also asked for a job on the Clinton campaign, and, the icing on the corruption cupcake? Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch, who famously met with Bill Clinton on her private plane right before Hillary＊s interrogation about Emailgate. ( source ) We all knew that the Clinton Foundation was just a way for the Clinton family to launder money, and now there＊s proof. Zero Hedge writes, ※＃today＊s Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band＊s firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family＊s private business endeavors.§ A pundit called this leak ※The Rosetta Stone of the Clinton Foundation,§ meaning that with this document, all of their shady financial dealings could be unraveled and translated. ( source ) Clinton is unable to speak for very long without a podium to lean on . Numerous leaked emails reference how certain interviews have to be kept short because she＊d be without one. And this article references a very interesting reason why this may be the case 每 surprisingly it isn＊t related to her health. ( source ) The leaks also show that Clinton intends to do her best to restrict the Second Amendment. Brian Fallon, the national press secretary for the Clinton campaign, wrote, ※ Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President 每 universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability .§ According to an analysis on The Daily Sheeple, ※Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook, Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold.§ ( source ) The campaign was concerned that the sexual escapades of Bill Clinton could be likened to those of another disgraced celebrity, Bill Cosby . Political operative Ron Klain sent an urgent email saying that Hillary should anticipate the following questions, § How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did? Is his conduct relevant to your campaign? You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused him? Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?§ ( source ) Clinton＊s campaign deliberately leaked an embarrassing photo of a swimsuit-clad Bernie Sanders to the press, ironically insinuating that it was proof he was bought off by Wall Street. Perez Hilton wrote, ※ Bernie Sanders lounges at elite Martha＊s Vineyard pool, summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists .§ ( source ) Clinton admitted she is out of touch with the middle class in a speech to Goldman-Black Rock in 2014. ※And I am not taking a position on any policy, but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. And I never had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean, were there really rich people, of course there were. My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We had accessible health care. We had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn＊t believe in mortgages. So I lived that. And now, obviously, I＊m kind of far removed because the life I＊ve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy , but I haven＊t forgotten it.§ ( source ) She made this rather NWO remark at a 2013 paid speech to Brazilian bank Banco Itau: ※ My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders , some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.§ ( source ) In a leak of yet another paid speech, this time to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013, Clinton said that Jordan and Turkey ※ can＊t possibly vet all those refugees so they don＊t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.§ Meanwhile, if Clinton has her way , we will be warmly welcoming 65,000 refugees a year, which makes Obama＊s 10,000 a year look like small potatoes. ( source ) Clinton blackmailed the Chinese by telling them that the US would base missiles in the region if they didn＊t exert some control over North Korean aggression. ※ So China, come on. You either control them or we＊re going to have to defend against them ,§ she purportedly told the audience at a Goldman Sachs conference in June 2013. ( source ) In May 2015, Clinton was no longer Secretary of State but was ready to announce she was running for President when she was invited to attend a summit in Morrocco. The implication from the leaked emails was that a $12 million ※donation§ from the king of Morocco was dependent on Clinton attending the summit. Human Abedin, usually loyal to her boss, had concerns . ※ If HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter. She created this mess and she knows it. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this,§ Abedin wrote to Robbie Mook in a November 2014 email. Incidentally, Clinton didn＊t attend. Bill and Chelsea went instead and the $12 million donation was not forthcoming. (source ) Podesta attacked Clinton＊s primary election rival Bernie Sanders for criticizing the Paris climate change agreement. ※ Can you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it? § said Podesta. ( source ) Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria . ※ My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,§ she told employees of the bank in South Carolina, which had paid her about $225,000 to give a speech. ※We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can＊t help themselves. They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we＊re doing and I want credit for it. § (source ) There is indeed a definite link between the Clinton campaign and what MSM is allowed to say. The campaign has colluded directly with media spokespersons that read like a Who＊s Who in American Media : Dan Merica from CNN, Haim Saban of Univision, John Harwood of CNBC and the NY Times, Rebecca Quick of CNBC, Maggie Haberman of NY Times and Politico, John Harris of Politico, Donna Brazile formerly of CNN, Roland Martin of TV-One, Marjorie Pritchard of The Boston Globe, and Louise Mensch of Heat Street. ( source ) As everyone knows, the DNC deliberately screwed Bernie Sanders out of the nomination ( Bonus: Wikileaks also released some of the DNC＊s voicemails on the topic ). There are emails that prove who is actually pulling HRC＊s puppet strings and that puppeteer is George Soros . The shadow government is not just a conspiracy theory 每 it really exists and Hillary＊s job is to keep George Soros happy. ( source ) Excerpts from her speeches to Wall Street read like a guide to two-faced treachery. In them, she clearly points out that sometimes you ※need§ to lie. ※If everybody＊s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.§ ( source ) Wikileaks emails show that back when she still worked for CNN and before she became an employee of the Clinton campaign, Donna Brazile gave Hillary the questions in advance for her ※impromptu§ CNN Town Hall questions. ( source ) The campaign got to ※approve§ articles in influential publications like NY Times, HuffPo, CNN, NBC, CBS, NYT, MSNBC, and Politico, showing a massive collusion with the mainstream media, who has hounded Trump relentlessly in an effort to distract from HRC＊s abysmal candidacy. ( source ) Through the treasure trove of Wikileaks emails, we can gain an accurate picture of how Hillary really feels about us all (spoiler: basket of deplorables, basement dwellers and right wing conspirators) ( source ) President Obama knew the whole time that her emails were not coming from the secure State Department server. Cheryl Mills wrote to John Podesta, ※W e need to clean this up 每 he has emails from her 每 they do not say state.gov .§ You see, Obama＊s emails all have to be from§whitelisted§addresses. So someone, somewhere, added her nonsecure email to his whitelist. ( source ) \nAnd finally, here＊s the real reason that treacherous shrew is involved in politics. And let me tell you, it isn＊t because she yearns to make things better for anyone but herself. (emphasis mine.) \nAt the Goldman Sachs Builders and Innovators Summit, Clinton responded to a question from chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, who quipped that you ※go to Washington§ to ※make a small fortune.§ Clinton agreed with the comment and complained about ethics rules that require officials to divest from certain assets before entering government. ※ There is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives, § Clinton said. ( source ) Together, we cannot be ignored. \nI am on a mission between now and the Presidential Election on November 8th and I hope that you will join me. \nI am going to work day and night to provide the coverage that the mainstream media is not. It isn＊t until we combine all of our voices that we can make people listen to the scandals, the rigging, and the corruption, not only in this election but in the system in general. Please join your voice with mine by liking, sharing, and spreading the word. \nTogether, we cannot be ignored. Together, we are an army.

    "text": "October 29, 2016 \nWrites Graham Dugas: \nComey has an insurrection on his hands beyond the ability of anyone to control. These mutinous senior FBI agents have enough dirt to toss Obama, Comey, Hillary and others in jail. They also loathe the idea of being subjected to Clinton in the future as they know they will be forced to perpetrate more cover-ups and stain the bureau even more. They presented Comey and Obama with a choice＃※give us Hillary＊s head on a platter and we will be silent on Obama＊s complicity in federal crimes [effectively a Nixon type pardon by omission of pursuit] and we will allow Comey to quietly be succeeded by a person of our choosing on an incoming Trump Administration.§ OR ELSE THEY WILL GO PUBLIC. Comey could have been silent until after the election no matter what they found on Weiner＊s laptop because they already have seen ALL the emails including the deleted ones. The fact that Comey is taking this action indicates that his hand is being forced and that he [and Obama] have accepted the terms offered by the insurrectionists in exchange for the face saving terms offered. This also dovetails with Assange saying his next batch [the FBI knows the contents of ALL of Podesta＊s emails] will result in the arrest of Hillary. The FBI cannot weather another PR storm revealing them complicit in a cover-up. They also must be proactive and use Hillary＊s arrest/indictment/forced withdrawal from the race as a lightning rod to quell a furious public by granting them their ＆pound of flesh＊. No one likes Hillary, and don＊t think that the Pentagon is going to silently sit still as one of their 4-Star generals get ramrodded for MUCH less than Hillary did. They are aligned with the insurrectionists at the FBI. Comey and Obama＊s hand is being forced. Hillary is toast and going to jail. You will know this is true within a few days because the sheriff is about to slap the cuffs on Hillary. Weiner＊s laptop is just a cover story. Tags:",

    "text": "Why Director Comey jumped at the chance to reopen Hillary investigation By Ed Klein Daily Mail October 31, 2016 New York Times bestselling author Ed Klein has just published his fourth book about the Clintons since 2005, Guilty as Sin. Klein had told how Bill Clinton enjoyed foot rubs, massages and romps in his presidential library with female interns and has described new details about Hillary＊s medical crises. Guilty as Sin is available in bookstores and for order from Amazon. James Comey＊s decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton＊s email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI, including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. \n＊The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn＊t recommend an indictment against Hillary,＊ said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. ＆Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,＊ said the source. ＆They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.＊ According to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom.",

    "title": "Why Comey Reopened the Hillary Investigation",
    "text": "By Joachim Hagopian October 31, 2016 \nThis last Friday it became public record that FBI Director James Comey reopened the Hillary Clinton email server investigation after repeatedly testifying before Congress and the world up to last July that he＊d closed the case , after in his words not finding sufficient evidence of ※any criminal wrongdoing § to indict her in spite of her four years as Secretary of State egregiously breaching our national security , committing obstruction of justice and willful tampering with evidence, deleting 30,000 emails after receiving a court subpoena constituting destruction of evidence, not to mention repeatedly engaging in perjury before Congress and the FBI. \nBut obviously, a federal investigation still in process in late June never stopped serial rapist-crime boss Bill Clinton＊s illegal ambush at the Phoenix airport of Comey＊s boss US Attorney General Loretta Lynch ※clearing§ the way for Hillary to proceed without consequence to be anointed as the next US figurehead puppet president by the ruling elite. Because it＊s so blatantly obvious to the entire world that Hillary is guilty as sin, Comey＊s whitewash didn＊t go over well with either Americans or longtime FBI agents who reacted angrily to Comey＊s over-the-top corruption. Subsequently, in recent months Comey has had a virtual mutiny on his hands as in the FBI boss has lost all credibility, respect, and moral authority. \nA former federal attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova spelled it all out in a WMAL radio interview last Friday just hours after the news was released that Comey had sent a letter informing Congress that the case is being reopened. DiGenova said that with an open revolt brewing inside the FBI, Comey was forced to go public on Friday with reopening the investigation. The former DC attorney added that the FBI investigators discovered more emails on a phone confiscated from the former New York Congressman and separated husband Anthony Weiner that also included his wife and longtime Hillary＊s right-hand woman Huma Abedin＊s communications that allegedly bear pertinent relevance to the Hillary case. Funny how things have a karmic way of coming full circle 每 the Clintons first introduced Weiner and Abedin 15 years ago and they married a half dozen years ago. \nIn a separate FBI investigation involving Weiner＊s alleged sexting messages with a 15-year old minor , the phone in question was handed over to the FBI. The investigating teams of both the Weiner and Hillary cases compared notes and apparently additional emails not already issued by WikiLeaks or already in FBI possession recently came to light on Weiner＊s phone . The legions of rank and file FBI agents were already fuming over Comey＊s complete ethical and legal lapses in his choice not to indict Hillary. Joe diGenova believes that FBI personnel forced Comey＊s hand to reopen the investigation after giving him the ultimatum that if he failed to do so, the FBI defiantly would. According to diGenova, this latest plot twist only proves that: \nThe original investigation was not thorough, and that it was an incompetent investigation. \nOtherwise, had a real investigation been conducted, that Weiner phone used by both Anthony and Huma would have been picked up by the FBI and its contents thoroughly scrutinized long before now. \nIn addition to stating the obvious, that the higher-up feds had already made the decision to not consequence Hillary for her crimes, speculating on why that phone was not already submitted to the FBI as evidence, the former DC attorney concluded: \nThere could be one explanation: Huma Abedin may have denied that any other phone existed, and if she did, she committed a felony. She lied to the FBI just like General Cartwright , and if she did, she＊s dead meat, and Comey knows it, and there＊s nothing he can do about it. \nFinally, diGenova dropped one more bombshell in Friday＊s interview. An inside source has revealed to him that the laptops belonging to key Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, both wrongly granted immunity , were not destroyed after all as previously reported, but have been secretly kept intact by investigating FBI agents refusing to destroy incriminating evidence as part of the in-house whitewash. Additionally like their boss, Hillary＊s aides also sent classified material using private servers. On top of that, longtime aide Cheryl Mills on multiple occasions has perjured herself lying under oath for the Clinton crime family, tasked with ※cleaning up§ (aka covering up) their countless scandals over the past several decades. Indeed the whole Clinton entourage not already ※mysteriously§ winding up in the growing Clinton dead pool are all unindicted criminals protected by the corrosively corrupt DC cronyism where backroom deals (a la Bill＊s airport ambush) are brokered based on whatever dirt＊s been gathered and used as bargaining blackmail chips against all parties involved. That＊s how the Washington crowd stays immune from any and all accountability as well as stays alive. Violate that crime syndicate code of conduct and you lose your life as more recent victims earlier this year have. \nIn a ※leaked§ memo to his FBI that surfaced on Fox Friday night, Comey outlined his reasons for reopening the case in light of the new information the director believes would have ultimately been leaked to Congress and the public anyway. So in full damage control/CYA mode, the beleaguered director now going public really had no choice in the matter. His underlings were chomping at the bit to both out and oust him. In an obvious attempt to weakly claim some moral high ground, Comey wrote in his memo: \nI also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record. \nThough his leadership and character are perceived by the vast majority of both FBI personnel as well as American citizens to presently lay in ruin as a pathetically shameful stain and humiliating joke on both the FBI organization and Washington in general, James Comey appears to be feebly attempting to save his own career and reputation for appearing now to ※come clean.§ But make no mistake, his moral turpitude displayed throughout this Hillary debacle from early 2015 to now has over-exposed him as a total lackey and fraud, so at this late stage of the game, redemption is not even an option. But the criminal misconduct, rampant corruption and diabolical evil committed by those at the highest puppet levels of federal power, and especially the elite puppet masters controlling them, their sins produce far more devastating consequences than this morally lacking man in the middle of this latest controversy. \nBecause there is no way that the FBI will properly conclude this part 2 of the Hillary investigation saga before the November 8 th election, Hillary, and her Democrats are predictably crying foul , demanding that the FBI immediately disclose what it has, which of course is a moot point that won＊t happen. It seems highly unlikely that the email texts from Abedin and Weiner found on his phone would not contain clear criminal evidence that implicates Hillary. Since Hillary was the globalist choice after Obama was selected in 2008, it seems unlikely that the puppet masters would not permit this latest development to even occur. But then perhaps the ruling elite is pulling the plug on Hillary, concluding that she simply carries too much liability baggage with her deteriorating health condition and never-ending scandals, maybe the globalists are rethinking an alternative replacement like her obnoxiously aggressive VP candidate, the Jesuit-trained and educated Tim Kaine. \nThat said, there are some cynics who believe that this recent odd turn is the last ditch desperado attempt being staged to overturn Trump winning by a landslide. This conjectured scenario goes something like this: a few days prior to the election the FBI will once again ※clear§ Hillary of all charges. This, in turn, would offer her the last minute much needed boost being able to cash in on her worn out persecution complex , plagued forever by her ※right wing conspiracy§ theory against the ※much maligned§ woman of destiny. \nIn response to all her scandals, Hillary＊s M.O. has always been to falsely blame some villainous sinister force. This year it＊s been Putin hacking into her emails, and Trump, Putin, and Assange colluding and plotting behind her back. She＊s always been as paranoid as Richard Nixon , attempting to deflect the heat she draws from her own skullduggery lies by constantly pointing fingers to externalize blame onto others. It＊s a deeply rooted pathological complex that certain tightly screwed sociopaths possess. \nThis latest sudden turn of events obviously has James Comey incurring the wrath of Hillary Democrats as well as the Justice Department. By disclosing the reopened investigation so close to the election date that undoubtedly casts some influence on the potential outcome, Comey is defying his AG boss while clearly violating DOJ written policy . Lynch herself even tried to quash Comey＊s letter to Congress. But as diGenova alluded, by Comey＊s own past misdeeds (and those of his boss and Obama as well), the FBI director placed himself between this rock and a hard place by his own slipshod, half-ass probe failing to acquire Weiner＊s phone the first time around. \nThe entire sordid affair of this year＊s totally rigged political election 每 pre-fixed in Hillary＊s favor 每 blatantly reveals to America the gross misnomer of the US ※justice§ system being two-tiered, one for elitist crime cabal bosses like Hillary and the other for the rest of us 99% no longer protected in a totalitarian police state by our once rule of law the US Constitution. Regardless of what happens in the future, the truth genie＊s already been let out of the bag, and for eyes open enough to see, it＊s floating in the Washington cesspool of filth, debauchery and deception regularly perpetrated by our ※entrusted perps§ we have as our so called leaders. \nMoreover, this year＊s unending batches of Wiki-leaked DNC/Hillary emails and Project Veritas undercover campaign videos confirm that the entire US political, as well as economic system, is morally and financially bankrupt, irreparably broken and in need of complete overhaul. Voter fraud and election fraud are rampant. Soros funded electronic voting machines that are preprogrammed to vote for Hillary are operating in 16 key battleground states. America＊s internal house now is in total disarray, badly in need of a deep cleaning purge like never before. Mainstream media is strongly biased against Trump in its blind support for Hillary . As Secretary of State she treasonously sold out our nation, placing us all at high security risk and under foreign interest control at the hands of high rolling bidders so she and her fat cats can get richer as fellow partners-in-crime from places like Saudi Arabia and Israel, destroying our once sovereign country while aiding, abetting, financing and supporting our enemies the global terrorists around the world. She helped create ISIS and plans world war against Russia, China and Iran. The traitors in our government and their globalist puppet masters 每 the Rothschilds, Rockefellers , the Bushes and Clintons all need to be rounded up, imprisoned and tried at The Hague for both treason and their endless crimes against humanity.

    "text": "Trump Wants To Nuke ISIS, But Says Hillary Would Start WWIII? WTF?? (VIDEO) By Grownmangrumbles   \nIt＊s been over 71 years since nuclear weapons were used in anger but Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump believes that the next atomic war is just around the corner. Speaking to Reuters yesterday he said : ※What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria. You＊re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.§ Unclear Fusion Of Ideas \nYou might have noticed that Trump is a little obsessed with the idea of nuclear war. He talks about it a lot . He seems to be attracted to the idea of simply smiting his enemies, in much the same way the God of the Old Testament used to deal with those who failed to show the proper respect. It＊s more than a little disturbing. \nEspecially when you realize how little he understands geopolitical reality. His grasp of such things are so facile that they border on criminal levels of ignorance. If anyone is likely to fire off a couple of nukes, it＊s Trump. \nWhen told by CNN＊s Chris Matthews that world leaders didn＊t want to hear that a man running for president wanted to use nuclear weapons on his enemies, Trump asked simply : ※Then why are we making them?§ \nThe answer to that question dates back to 1957 when Horrace Gaither presented President Eisenhower with the controversial Deterrence & Survival in the Nuclear Age report. The report was commissioned in order to research how best the United States might provide fallout shelters for its citizens. It soon reached a chilling and unexpected conclusion. The best a fallout shelter could achieve was to allow Americans the agony of a slow painful death. \nIndeed, the only way to survive a nuclear war was to ensure that one never happened. Plans to build mass civilian shelters were sidelined in favor of a policy that was given the most aptly chosen acronym of all times: Mutually Assured Destruction. M.A.D. \nThat Trump has failed to master even a high school level understanding of geopolitics is kind of a big deal. \nHe seems to believe that foreign policy actions are something that can be intuited, rather than studied. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , for example has been in force since 1970. The whole reason for its existence is to limit access to nuclear weapons. \nWith a few notable exceptions, the treaty has been a success. \nNot so, says Trump. \nIn March , he suggested that Japan, a country constitutionally forbidden from the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes, should create its own nuclear weapons. Citing America＊s inability to pay for Japan＊s protection, he felt that they might benefit from their very own atomic security blanket. \nPresident Barack Obama was concise in his assessment of Trump＊s plan. Speaking at a press conference during the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit in Washington DC, he said : ※The person who made the statements doesn＊t know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean peninsula or the world generally ＃ We don＊t want somebody in the Oval Office who doesn＊t recognize how important that is.§ Nuclear Bore \nThe 71 years that have passed without any nation using devastating WMD on one another did not happen by accident. At the close of World War II, statesmen were forced to tackle the realities of modern warfare. World War I killed 5 million people and wounded 12 million more. WWII killed ten times that number. An atomic war might kill us all. \nIn fact, it almost certainly would. \nTheir plans, treaties, and compromises were far from perfect, but they worked, and they continue to work. We can be thankful for that. \nBecause if there were to be such a war in 2017, it wouldn＊t be Clinton pressing the button. \nIt would be the satsuma-like hand of a volatile, narcissistic amateur deciding to rage-quit a world that just doesn＊t seem to understand what a wonderful, tremendous guy he is. \nWatch Trump refuse to rule out the use of nuclear weapons: \nFeatured image via MemeGenerator /Trump caricature by DonkeyHotey via Flickr under a CC BY-SA 2.0 license \nAbout Grownmangrumbles \nI'm a full- time, somewhat unwilling resident of the planet Earth.

    "text": "GOP: We Will Be United Against Any Supreme Court Nominee Of Hillary Clinton (VIDEO) By Karen Shiebler on October 27, 2016 \nWhen Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died last February, it threw the United States Supreme Court into chaos. The unexpected death meant that the Court was reduced to only eight members, making the likelihood of tie votes a real possibility. \nA tie means no decision, rendering the Supreme Court essentially powerless. \nPresident Obama quickly nominated a replacement for the super conservative Scalia. He chose the very moderate Judge Merrick Garland for the position. He hoped that his choice of a middle-of-the-road, white male might soften Republican opposition to the appointment. \nNo such luck. As stiff necked as always, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) dug in his heels and refused to allow the Senate to even hold a hearing on Garland＊s nomination. \nWhy, you ask? Because Sen. McConnell and the rest of the GOP leadership insisted it would be better to allow the next President to choose the new Justice. \nDemocrats were frustrated, but there was nothing to be done. The Republicans wanted to wait for the ※next President,§ so that＊s what would happen. \nNow, however, to the surprise of absolutely no one in the word, the GOP is backing away from its own proposal. It looks more and more likely that the ※next President§ will be Hillary Clinton, and the Republicans want to eat their words. \nLast week Sen. John McCain (R-Az) said this : ※I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up. I promise you.§ That shocking statement was at first denounced by some in the GOP, but now it is gaining support within the Party. Some conservative legal scholars are giving their support to the outrageous idea. Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute says that the Senate would within its legal rights to simply refuse to approve any nominee of the Democratic President. He writes that the Constitution is silent of the question of whether or not the Senate is required to fill vacant seats on the Court. Other legal experts agree that the Constitution would technically allow the Senate to leave the Court essentially powerless, with eight seats divided between the two parties＊ points of view. Most also agree that leaving the Court divided would be disastrous. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said : ※ I t＊s much more difficult for us to do our job if we are not what we＊re intended to be 求 a court of nine.§ This level of obstructionism is completely unprecedented in American history. If in fact the Republicans chose to ignore any nominee, no matter who it might be, then they are stating an intention to upset the entire balance of power in this country. Republicans love to refer to the Founding Fathers, and they love to claim that they adhere to the principals those founders introduced. To eliminate one entire branch of our three branch government system would be far beyond irresponsible. It would be completely unAmerican.

    "title": "There Are A Lot Of Born-Again Women Who Are Closet Hillary Supporters (TWEETS)",
    "text": "There Are A Lot Of Born-Again Women Who Are Closet Hillary Supporters (TWEETS) By Darrell Lucus   Hillary Clinton at the 2014 United Methodist Women Conference ( image courtesy United Methodist Women, available under a Creative Commons BY-NC-ND license) \nFor much of the campaign, there was talk that Donald Trump＊s support was a lot greater than it seemed because of a large number of closet Trump supporters每a bloc of support for the Donald that isn＊t showing up in most polls. That seems hard to believe. After all, you would have thought that those secret Trump backers would have come out of hiding during Hillary Clinton＊s bad week in September. Even then, Hillary never dropped below 54 percent in the FiveThirtyEight average 每and Nate Silver＊s model responds fairly strongly to sharp changes in good polls. \nA much more plausible scenario comes from Lyz Lenz, a freelance writer who is also one of the embedded liberals at her evangelical church in her small Iowa town. In a revealing piece for Marie Claire, Lenz tells us that there are a considerable number of born-again women who are backing Hillary每but just keeping quiet about it. \nIt＊s not hard to see why. Hillary has been one of the religious right＊s pet hates for almost three decades. This was true long before Bill Clinton was ensnared in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, for which many born-agains still haven＊t forgiven him. Additionally, in much of the evangelical world, women are expected to follow their husband＊s lead in virtually all matters每including politics. \nAdd it up, and it＊s no wonder that a number of evangelical Hillary supporters feel they have to stay in the closet每and even feign support for Trump. This is particularly true in red-tinted small towns across America. Lenz describes this as the ※spiral of silence§每fear of being shunned when you voice an unpopular opinion. \nLenz saw this first-hand. When she went to caucus for Hillary, she was surprised to see her friend ※Melody,§ the former head of a Christian non-profit and one of the most respected leaders in her town＊s evangelical circle, was also heading for the Hillary section. Over the next few months, she＊s met several other women in her town who are secretly backing Hillary. \nOne of them, ※Jennifer,§ works at a faith-based non-profit that helps women in need. The prevailing mentality there is that the GOP is ※the only acceptable choice§ on election day. For that reason, she has to bite her tongue even when one of her coworkers shares nasty anti-Hillary memes on Facebook. Most of the time, she lets her colleagues believe she＊s supporting Trump as well, since most evangelicals assume that ※others are like them.§ My girlfriend can attest to this; she once told me that when she went to her precinct at the time每a church每she mused about how everyone in line would react if they knew she was voting for Obama. \nEven in households where both spouses back Hillary, the prospect of getting bombarded with twenty questions is enough for some women to keep their support for Hillary secret. One of them, ※Susan,§ has gotten in a number of knock-down, drag-out arguments with friends, co-workers, and family members who can＊t understand how her husband can support Hillary. As a result, she feels she doesn＊t have ※the energy to go there§ and reveal she supports Hillary as well. \nFortunately, these closet Hillary voters aren＊t alone. A number of private ※Secret Hillary Clubs§ have mushroomed on Facebook, and offer support and encouragement for Hillary supporters in fire-engine red areas. One woman in this club, ※Amy,§ remembers how her parents frequently called Hillary a ※liar§ or a ※bitch§ when she appeared on TV. Since she still lives near them in Ohio, she finds it ※very difficult to openly support Hillary.§ \nHowever, the release of the ※Access Hollywood§ tapes seems to have prompted more evangelical women to speak out against Trump. For instance, one of the first evangelical leaders to blast Trump＊s debauchery was author and speaker Beth Moore. She made her feelings loud and clear in an epic tweetstorm on October 9. Wake up, Sleepers, to what women have dealt with all along in environments of gross entitlement & power. Are we sickened? Yes. Surprised? NO \n〞 Beth Moore (@BethMooreLPM) October 9, 2016 Try to absorb how acceptable the disesteem and objectifying of women has been when some Christian leaders don't think it's that big a deal. \n〞 Beth Moore (@BethMooreLPM) October 9, 2016 I'm one among many women sexually abused, misused, stared down, heckled, talked naughty to. Like we liked it. We didn't. We're tired of it. \n〞 Beth Moore (@BethMooreLPM) October 9, 2016 \"Keep your mouth shut or something worse will happen.\" Yes. I'm familiar with the concept. Sometimes it's terrifyingly true. Still, we speak \n〞 Beth Moore (@BethMooreLPM) October 9, 2016 \nRussell Moore (no relation to Beth), the president of the Southern Baptist Convention＊s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission and a prominent member of the ※Never Trump§ crowd,§ told The Daily Beast that a number of evangelical women have privately told him that they were ※horrified§ and disgusted how so many Christian leaders continued to rally behind Trump. Many of them, Russell Moore said, have spent years teaching girls to ※find their identity in Christ and not in an American culture that sexualizes and objectifies them,§ and are disgusted that their male counterparts are still backing a man who seems to be doing both. \nIn some circles, however, the opening began long before 2016. My low-key charismatic church in Charlotte, for instance, is split almost down the middle politically; the sizable klatch of liberals there每including yours truly每don＊t feel pressured to keep our views in the closet. I started dating my current girlfriend during the primaries, and she was a Bernie Sanders supporter. When I first brought her to my church, no one raised an eyebrow at her Bernie bumper sticker每or my Hillary sticker. Hopefully this is a sign that evangelical women who are leaning toward the Democrats can finally come out of the shadows.

    "text": "Hillary Clinton Is DEFINITELY Going To Win. Here＊s How We Know (DETAILS) By Carrie MacDonald   \nThe famous electoral prognosticator Larry Sabato recently shocked a CNN host when he boldly proclaimed that he believed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton would win the presidency with 352 electoral votes. Looking at the math, though 352 may be a stretch, we WILL inaugurate the first woman president on January 20, 2017. The Road To 270 \nAs I discussed in detail in my Electoral College 101 piece for Liberal America , a presidential candidate must win 270 of the 538 total electoral college votes in order to win the presidency. It is possible for this to happen even when a candidate does not win the popular vote, as we saw in the election of 2000. \nAs it stands now, with fewer than two weeks to go, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could win all the states that are expected to vote red, including the ones that just ※lean§ Republican, AND every single swing state, and he still will not win the election. All those states would give him just 245 votes. That＊s 25 short of a win. \nOn the other hand, if Clinton wins every state that is expected to vote blue, as she is expected to do, she will have 293 electoral votes. The Cook Political Scorecard And FiveThirtyEight \nThe Cook Political Report , a non-partisan newsletter, published the following scorecard on October 27, 2016: Screenshot via The Cook Political Report \nAs you can see, the math looks grim for the Donald. If he wins the 179 votes he＊s expected to win PLUS the 66 that are the tossup votes, he＊s still short. \nThe Cook report still has Florida as a tossup (swing) state. However, Nate Silver＊s current projection for that state 〞 the most coveted of all swing states in any presidential race 〞 has Clinton winning. Screenshot via Fivethirtyeight.com \nThe New York Times has a great interactive tool on The Upshot portion of their website as well. The tool assumes certain electoral votes going to each candidate, and you can try different scenarios to see how many paths to victory each candidate has. As the math goes, if you give every blue state shown above to Clinton, she wins. The Upshot puts Clinton＊s chances of winning at 92 percent. \nBasically, only something monumentally catastrophic will cause her to lose this election. You Still Have To VOTE \nOf course, despite our headline here, everyone still has to vote to make this a reality. If Democrats get complacent, then that map could get a lot redder. That＊s what tends to happen in ※off-year§ elections, since the Republicans are a lot more likely to get out and vote. It＊s why we have a House of Representatives that has been gerrymandered to the point that it＊s nearly impossible for the Democrats to regain control of it. \nIn 2012, House Democrats received more votes than Republicans, yet the Republicans retained control. Why? Redistricting. Had more Democrats voted in 2010, we may not be in such a predicament. Districts are redrawn at least once every 10 years, and the party that controls each state＊s legislature generally tends to redraw them to their party＊s favor. While some (myself included) may argue that districts should be drawn in a much more equitable manner, the fact remains that, currently, the party in power draws the district to their favor. \nSo go out and vote. Not just this year, but in every election. Every time. Vote in your local elections. Vote in primaries and general elections. Make your voice heard. \nAnd let＊s make this map even more blue.",

In an op-ed for The Washington Post, Miller said that Comey＊s decision to ※editorialize§ Hillary＊s behavior was ※not grounded in any position in law.§ In his Friday tweetstorm, Miller blasted the FBI for sending details of the investigation to Congress.

Then multiply that times ten close to an election. 9/ \n〞 Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 \n\nMiller＊s hunch was confirmed later in the day as more details dribbled out. It turns out that the FBI discovered these emails while investigating former Congressman Anthony Weiner for inappropriate texts with a minor. The emails were found on a device Weiner shared with his estranged wife, longtime Hillary aide Huma Abedin. \nAccording to NBC News＊ Pete Williams, however, there doesn＊t appear to be anything that even comes close to a smoking gun每at least for now. Williams discussed his findings on MSNBC on Friday afternoon; watch here, via Jaffy＊s Twitter. NBC＊s Pete Williams: Sr. officials say〞During separate investigation ※a device§ led to add'l emails每not from Clinton https://t.co/QmmNoxXhOx \n〞 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 28, 2016 \nWilliams went further in another MSNBC interview later in the afternoon; watch here. \nWilliams believes that there are two questions每whether the number of emails changed, and whether anyone withheld evidence. His FBI sources tell him that those emails were not withheld by Hillary or her campaign. Moreover, the emails are not from Hillary. That raises the obvious question每was there any defensible reason to make such a disclosure? \nMiller thinks there wasn＊t, and told CNN＊s Jake Tapper so later that afternoon. Watch here. \nMiller said that longstanding DOJ practice calls for the department and its various agencies to avoid doing anything that could potentially influence the results of an election within 60 days of Election Day. When Tapper asked Miller if the FBI could have been accused of bias toward Hillary had Comey remained silent, Miller said he didn＊t think so in this case because ※there＊s no information to be released.§ That letter never disclosed what triggered this new review, and thus forces Hillary to ※defend against a negative.§ \nUnderstandably, Hillary＊s campaign wants to know that justified this disclosure from the FBI.

    "text": "Rabid Clinton Hating Conservative Blogger Goes Rogue, Endorses Hillary. Here＊s Why (VIDEO) By Karen Shiebler on October 29, 2016 Subscribe \nAndrew Sullivan is a well known libertarian thinker. He is an author, a blogger and an outspoken conservative commentator. \nSullivan used to cover the Clinton White House for the New Republic. From the earliest days, he had negative feelings about the Clintons. In describing the Clintons, he said: ※They are very much the establishment. They are very much after money. They are very much after power.§ Sullivan was born and raised in England, but attended and graduated from Harvard University, where he earned both Masters and Doctoral degrees in government. The writer ties his conservative beliefs to his Roman Catholic upbringing in a family or Irish descent. Andrew Sullivan has long been outspoken about his dislike for Hillary Clinton. During an appearance on Real Time With Bill Maher, he referred to the former Secretary of State as a ※talentless hack.§ He bashed her ※disastrous§ time as Secretary, citing the situations in Libya and Iraq as evidence of her lack of judgement. Maher accused Sullivan of hating Hillary, and he didn＊t disagree. So it has come as a big surprise to many that Sullivan is now publicly and prominently saying, ※I＊m with her.§ The sharp tongued Clinton critic is now planning to vote for her and he is clear about why. He told Brian Williams of MSNBC : ※There is almost no scenario I could imagine in which I might actually support Hillary Clinton for president except this. Because I honestly believe that Donald J. Trump is not just a normal candidate in this election; that he is a threat to our entire democratic system, that his appearance to the top of the national ticket is probably the gravest crisis in this country＊s modern history. And I think defeating him is not just something that we should take as a Democrat or Republican or even as a sort of a way of expressing ourselves. It is a way to say for the moment the very core principles of liberal democracy that he is attacking on a daily almost hourly basis.§ When one of our most outspoken conservative decides that he has to vote for the Democrat out of love for the country, things are looking grim for the GOP. Donald Trump is in deep trouble when someone like Andrew Sullivan calls him the ※gravest crisis§ in our recent history. Oh, and one more thing. This will be the very first vote that Andrew Sullivan will be casting as a new American citizen. I hope all of his conservative fans follow in his footsteps. \nFeatured image via MSNBC Video Screengrab .

    "title": "FBI Director Comey Ignored DOJ＊s Warning Against Releasing Info On Hillary Email (TWEETS)",
    "text": "Subscribe \nOn Friday, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that his agency had discovered emails that could potentially be related to the flap over Hillary Clinton＊s email server. In the 24 hours since then, most of the discussion hasn＊t been over the emails, but over whether Comey acted appropriately when he made this disclosure. Well, a front page story in Sunday morning＊s edition of The New York Times reveals that Comey＊s bosses at the Justice Department believed this letter was manifestly improper . \nThe reason? Comey＊s letter risked running afoul of a longstanding DOJ policy that strongly discourages commenting on politically sensitive investigations within 60 days of an election. It is a policy that has been maintained by both Democratic and Republican administrations in order to avoid even the appearance of partisanship. We can all agree, however, that if there is any case for an exception, it would be if there was a potentially earth-shaking development in a politically-charged investigation. \nBut based on what has emerged since Friday, Comey＊s letter didn＊t even begin to meet that standard. According to The Times, the FBI is in the process of getting court permission to review emails it seized from the laptop of longtime Hillary aide Huma Abedin while investigating her estranged husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner, for sexting with a North Carolina teenager. Investigators don＊t know as of yet whether those emails contain classified information, or whether it even potentially rose to the level of criminal misconduct. Additionally, there is virtually no chance that such a review will be complete before the election. \nThat explains why Comey＊s draft letter, which was prepared on Thursday, sent eyebrows into hairlines at the DOJ. According to CNN, department staffers told Comey that Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates opposed sending the letter . They told Comey in no uncertain terms that under the circumstances, the letter ran counter to the longstanding policy about politically sensitive investigations. However, according to The Times, Comey believed that the emails would almost certainly be leaked每and the FBI would be accused of misleading Congress. \nHowever, a number of former DOJ officials think Comey made an egregious blunder. I already told you that Matthew Miller, the former chief spokesman for the DOJ under Lynch＊s predecessor, Eric Holder, condemned the letter in the strongest terms on Friday. But Comey has been condemned by veterans of Republican administrations as well. One of them, George Terwilliger III, the deputy attorney general for the last two years of the George H. W. Bush administration, was particularly baffled by Comey＊s move. Terwilliger said that while the guidelines on politically sensitive investigations can make for ※hard decisions§ at times, there was ※a difference between flying independent and flying solo.§ \nKurt Eichenwald of Vanity Fair and Newsweek revealed on Twitter that a number of FBI agents are up in arms over this letter as well. Word from inside @FBI . FURIOUS at Comey, think he's mishandled public revelations from get go. \"Outrageous incompetence\" one agent told me. \n〞 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 If Comey doesn't get ahead of this, going to have a mutiny at @FBI . \"This is why u say 'We dont talk about investigations'\" one told me＃. \n〞 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 ＃his original decision to lay out info on clinton case, then opine on what it meant outside of criminal findings, infuriated these folks.. \n〞 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 Re: anger within @FBI at Comey.

Apparently Comey was so worried about the potential fallout that he felt compelled to brief Congress before his people even knew whether there was any there there, let alone before getting a court to allow them to find out what was in those emails. If that＊s the case, then Comey＊s judgment appears curious at best. You would think the FBI would be able to keep a lid on an investigation this explosive. \nDonald Trump＊s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, suggested that the Donald forced Comey＊s hand . If Comey was so afraid of being the victim of a Twitter attack from Trump and his alt-right army that it felt the need to throw fundamental fairness and time-honored precedent out the window, as well as leave his own agents on an island, then there is something fundamentally wrong. \n( featured image courtesy FBI Flickr feed, part of public domain) About Darrell Lucus \nDarrell is a 30-something graduate of the University of North Carolina who considers himself a journalist of the old school.

    "text": "DOJ COMPLAINT: Comey Under Fire Over Partisan Witch Hunt For Hillary (TWEETS/VIDEO) By Natalie Dailey on October 30, 2016 Subscribe \nFor pretty much this entire election, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has gotten flak for the way she handled her emails during her tenure as Secretary of State. Congressional Republicans grilled her for hours about it, but have found nothing. These same Republicans just keep on complaining anyway. \nNow, the Director of the FBI, James Comey, wrote a memo saying some newly-found emails may be linked to Hillary Clinton and her private server. \nThe media and the supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are excited about the possibility of the FBI reopening the investigation. \nSorry, guys, it＊s not. \nA Republican Congressman started a Twitter shitstorm over this news: FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \n〞 Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \nSpeaker of the House, Paul Ryan (R-Wis), said that Clinton＊s security briefings should stop: BREAKING NEWS ↙ The FBI is reopening its investigation into Secretary Hillary Clinton. \nMy full statement ? pic.twitter.com/LHfyg46dWk \n〞 Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) October 28, 2016 \nAt least Hillary Clinton didn＊t blab classified information on television. \nMany news outlets falsely reported that the entire investigation was back on. \nThe Associated Press tweeted: BREAKING: US official: Newly discovered emails related to Clinton investigation did not come from her private server. \n〞 AP Politics (@AP_Politics) October 28, 2016 \nThe emails were found during the investigation of disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner and his latest sexting scandal involving a 15-year-old girl. \nThe FBI doesn＊t know for sure what is in the emails. It is very difficult to read emails when you don＊t have a warrant to do so. This puts Comey＊s letter to Congress in an even shadier light. All they know is that none of the emails are to or from Clinton herself, and they may only be duplicates of emails the FBI already has in their possession. \nThe Department of Justice has received a complaint from the Democratic Coalition Against Trump accusing FBI Director Comey of violating the Hatch Act . \nThe complaint reads in part: ※This is an election year, and we are just 11 days away from the date that the American public votes to choose the next President of the United States, I am writing to ask that an investigation be opened into Director Comey for any potential violations of the Hatch Act. The timing of this announcement, accompanied by the vague facts of the investigation, seems as if Director Comey was making a political move, and not a professional one.§ \nPassed in 1939, the Hatch Act limits political activity of federal employees and certain state and D.C. employees who work with federal funding. It is meant to keep federal agencies from taking sides politically, and prevents employees from getting promotions based on political affiliations.",

Author and self-described ※capitalist evangelist§ Wayne Allyn Root was giving a rambling speech as a warm-up before Der Fuhrer Donald took the stage, and while portions of it were comparable to the rantings of Charles Manson after too much caffeine, it was the language Root used (highly militaristic and warlike) that you cannot help but notice. At various points in his unhinged diatribe, Root used the following phrases : ※Trump warriors§ ※Trump army§ ※Trump revolution§ \nThen, in full psychotic rant, Root attempted to mix together plot elements from the O.J. Simpson case with the movies Driving Miss Daisy and Thelma and Louise , telling the ecstatic crowd : ※It＊s Hillary in a White Ford Bronco. She＊s got Huma driving and they＊re headed for the Mexican border. I have a name for the future TV movie. It＊s called Driving Miss Hillary. And the ending, if we all get our wish, is like Thelma and Louise!§ \nFinally, Root ended his echo of Nuremberg by declaring: ※I will give you my country when you pry it from my cold dead hands.§ \nWhen I listen to Wayne Allyn Root (or any of the other fanatical Trumpkins), the movie that comes to mind for me is One Flew Over the Cuckoo＊s Nest. \nFeatured Image Via Right Wing Watch About Andrew Bradford \nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.

    "text": "Fox Host Jeanine Pirro: FBI ＆Disgraces And Politicizes＊ Itself With ＆Wrong＊ Letter About Hillary Emails (VIDEO) By Darrell Lucus on October 30, 2016 Subscribe \nIt＊s no surprise that Democrats are up in arms over FBI director James Comey＊s announcement to Congress that his agency was looking into emails that were potentially related to Hillary Clinton＊s email server. However, a number of Republicans每including a number of Comey＊s own agents每are also rolling their eyes in disgust . Well, on Saturday, another Republican joined that list . And that Republican happens to be a host on Fox News Channel. \nWhen Jeanine Pirro led off Saturday night＊s edition of ※Justice with Judge Jeanine,§ she hiked eyebrows into hairlines by blasting the manner in which Comey and the FBI handled this matter. Watch here. \nPirro got right to the point in her ※Opening Statement§每from where she＊s sitting, Comey＊s decision to send that letter ※both disgraces and politicizes the FBI§ and was the definition of ※all that is wrong in Washington.§ \nIt＊s no secret that Pirro is a staunch Donald Trump supporter. Indeed, she has spent most of the campaign finding ways to attack Hillary每to the point that The Washington Post＊s Erik Wemple called her ※a key Fox News apologist for Trump.§ But Pirro took off her red-tinted blinders long enough to come to the same conclusion as a number of other Republicans每there is no defence for the manner in which this was handled. ※Whether it＊s Hillary Clinton or anyone else, Comey＊s actions violate longstanding Justice Department policy, the directive of the person he works under, the Attorney General每but even more important, the most fundamental rules of fairness and impartiality.§ \nOn paper, unlike the average Fox News host, Pirro knows how investigations are supposed to be conducted. She was a prosecutor in Westchester County, New York每a wealthy suburban county north of New York City, and home to White Plains and Yonkers每for 15 years, a judge for three years, and Westchester County district attorney for 12 years. \nBut Pirro takes what happened to Hillary personally as well. She recalled that in 2006, when she was the Republican candidate for New York state attorney general, the FBI announced it was investigating her for secretly recording her husband almost a month before the election. Pirro contended that this announcement, like Comey＊s announcement about the emails, ran counter to longstanding Justice Department policy against commenting on potentially politically-charged investigations for at least 60 days before an election. \nThe investigation ultimately went nowhere. However, Pirro argued that ※the adverse publicity§ cost her dearly at the polls; she was ultimately routed by future governor Andrew Cuomo. For her, Friday＊s announcement brought back memories of how she believed she was treated a decade earlier. ※What happened to me in 2006 was wrong. And what happened to Hillary Clinton yesterday was equally wrong.§ \nIn the interest of fairness, it＊s not likely that the announcement in and of itself cost Pirro the election. New York was swept up in a massive Democratic wave that year, one that saw Eliot Spitzer win the governorship with the second-biggest victory for a statewide race in New York history. \nNonetheless, Pirro＊s point is very well taken每no responsible investigator should make public comments about politically-charged investigations this close to an election, unless there is something absolutely earth-shaking. She reminded her viewers that the DOJ/FBI rule against commenting publicly on politically-charged investigations is in place for a reason每※announcements so close to elections have an impact,§ and the FBI should not even appear to have ※its finger on the scales of justice.§ \nLike a judge scolding a lawyer, Pirro then knocked down two of the arguments that have been advanced in favor of Comey writing the letter. She didn＊t see anything in his congressional testimony that would have left him with no option short of a public announcement. What about fears of leaks? Well, Pirro said Comey should have collared the committee chairs to whom the letter was addressed and told them, ※If this gets out, I＊ll know that you did it.§ Pirro left out what may have been the biggest argument of all每at the time, the FBI hadn＊t even obtained a warrant for those emails. It finally did so on Sunday night. \nApparently Pirro anticipated that this wouldn＊t go over too well in fair and balanced land; she closed by reverting to the usual GOP talking point that Hillary would be facing charges right now had Comey conducted a real investigation in the first place. It didn＊t save her. Most of the commenters on two Facebook posts Pirro made on the matter have argued Comey had no other option. \nThen again, it＊s not entirely surprising. After all, most Fox News viewers don＊t think any Democratic president is legitimate in the first place, so apparently they＊re perfectly fine with fundamental fairness being thrown out the window. The mere fact that we have to applaud Pirro for having the guts to speak out against Comey＊s actions每which, at this point, seem incompetent at best每says a lot about the state of our discourse. And it isn＊t good. \n( featured image courtesy Pirro＊s Facebook) About Darrell Lucus \nDarrell is a 30-something graduate of the University of North Carolina who considers himself a journalist of the old school.

    "title": "John Podesta＊s Sister-in-Law Lobbied For Raytheon While Hillary Was Secretary of State",
    "text": "at 11:08 am 1 Comment \nThe Podesta family seems particularly adept at earning extraordinary sums of money via selling out the American public. Earlier this year, I highlighted how John Podesta＊s brother Tony was paid $140,000 per month by the medieval monarchy of Saudi Arabia. After all, who cares about women＊s rights when the pay is good? \nHere＊s a excerpt from the post, ※Getting Things Done§ 每 The Brother of Hillary Clinton＊s Campaign Chair is a Major Lobbyist for Saudi Arabia : The kingdom employs a total of eight American firms that perform lobbying, consulting, public relations and legal work. Five of the firms work for the Saudi Arabia Embassy, while another two 〞 Podesta Group and BGR Group 〞 have registered to represent the Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court, an arm of the government. PR giant Edelman, meanwhile, is working for the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority to encourage international investment. The Podesta Group is billing Saudi Arabia $140,000 a month for its public relations services. During the last few months of 2015, it sent 27 emails, had two phone calls and one meeting with lawmakers and staffers, journalists, and organizations including Human Rights Watch and the Center for American Progress, disclosure forms show. DLA Piper receives $50,000 a month from the kingdom and sent hundreds of emails to top congressional staffers between September and the end of February regarding meeting requests and, more generally, ※issues affecting U.S.-Saudi Arabia national security interests.§ \nNotice the firm DLA Piper mentioned above. You＊ll want to remember that for later. \nMoving along, the Podestas are diligent about making sure everyone gets to feed at the trough, including extended family. \nAs James Rosen of Fox News uncovers: \nAmid the tumult of the 2016 presidential campaign, John Podesta is best known as Hillary Clinton＊s campaign chairman and the individual from whose private account WikiLeaks is presently publishing some 50,000 hacked emails. \nFor several months in 2012, Clinton＊s final year as secretary of state, Raytheon, the leading defense contractor, hired Podesta＊s sister-in-law, Heather Podesta, as a lobbyist, federal records show. \nRaytheon was looking to enlarge its share of foreign military sales 每 transfers of advanced weapons systems to other countries that are reviewed and approved by the Department of State, then implemented by the Department of Defense 每 and was beefing up its lobbying operation to accomplish that goal before Secretary Clinton left office. \nAt the same time, Raytheon retained two other lobbyists, John Merrigan and Matt Bernstein, both associated with the powerhouse D.C. law firm DLA Piper. All three of these lobbyists, including Ms. Podesta, were major donors or bundlers to Hillary Clinton＊s 2008 and 2016 campaigns. Federal records show they have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Clinton＊s campaigns and earned hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying her State Department. \nThere＊s DLA Piper again. They appears to have their fingers in all realms of the military-industrial complex cookie jar. \nIn the final three quarters of 2012, DLA Piper earned some $360,000 in lobbying fees from Raytheon, courting the State Department and other agencies, while Ms. Podesta, within that same time frame, received $100,000 from Raytheon for the same purpose. \nThe gambit appears to have worked: Records maintained by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the arm of the Defense Department that coordinates the transfers of weapons systems once they have received State＊s approval, show Raytheon as a prime contractor in at least seventeen foreign military sales in 2012, worth an estimated total of $26 billion. Of those contracts, three with the Gulf nation of Qatar 每 for missile defense, Apache attack helicopters and other materiel 每 accounted for $19 billion. \nThe individual at the State Department who was statutorily entrusted to approve foreign military sales was Andrew Shapiro, the assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs. Prior to his nomination to that job, Shapiro had served as Clinton＊s national security adviser in her Senate office. Today, Shapiro is a partner in a Washington consulting firm whose other co-founders include Philippe Reines, Clinton＊s longtime press aide. \nYou starting to see how all this works? \nThe firm mentioned above is Beacon Global Strategies, and I covered them in this summer＊s post: New York Times Fails to Disclose Op-Ed Writer＊s Ties to Hillary Clinton＊s ＆Principal Gatekeeper＊ . \nAfter Clinton stepped down as secretary of state in February 2013, Raytheon discontinued the services of Heather Podesta + Partners, and ceased its use of DLA Piper at State. \nWhile experts do not believe any laws were broken, the affair illustrates how Washington worked in the first Obama term, and particularly at the Clinton State Department. The Raytheon operation bears some similarity to a pop-up store that materializes to serve a seasonal need, such as Halloween candy or July Fourth fireworks, then vanishes once that need has been met. \nSimply incredible. \n※I think this is as close an example of pay-to-play as we＊ve seen,§ said Raj Shah, deputy communications director at the Republican National Committee. ※And that＊s why [Raytheon] made these hires [of Heather Podesta, Merrigan and Bernstein]. ＃ Their experience was getting access to Hillary Clinton and raising money for her.§ \nBut hey＃",

    "title": "Berkley Professor Claims Hillary Clinton Email Investigation Nothing More Than a Sexist ＆Bitch Hunt＊",
    "text": "at 3:47 pm Leave a comment \nToday＊s college-related article is not about safe spaces, macro aggressions and trigger warnings. Rather, it＊s about a remarkably stupid claim made by Robin Lakoff (a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley), that the entire email scandal plaguing Hillary Clinton is a nothing more than a vast patriarchal driven conspiracy manufactured by men for the sole purpose of taking down a strong and powerful woman. No, I＊m not kidding. \n  delusional Time published article, Hillary Clinton＊s Emailgate Is an Attack on Women : \n＆It＊s not about emails; it＊s about public communication by a woman＊ \nI am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It＊s us. \nThe only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she＊s doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. \nIf the candidate were male, there would be no scolding and no ※scandal.§ Those very ideas would be absurd. Men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech. In theory, so do women, but that, as the creationists like to say, is only a theory. \nClinton＊s use of a personal server has not been found to be a crime. Then how is it that so many have found the charge so easy to make, and make stick? How has her use of the server made plausible all the claims that she is ※deceptive§ and ※untrustworthy§? \nIt＊s not about emails; it＊s about public communication by a woman in general. Of course, in the year 2016, no one (probably not even The Donald) could make this argument explicitly. After all, he and his fellow Republicans are not waging a war on women. How do we know that? They have said so. And they＊re men, so they must be telling the truth. \nBut here＊s Hillary Rodham Clinton, the very public stand-in for all bossy, uppity and ambitious women. Here are her emails. And since it＊s a woman, doing what decent women should never do〞engaging in high-level public communication〞well, there must be something wrong with that, even if we can＊t quite find that something. We will invoke the terminology of criminal law to account for our feelings. She＊s getting away with treason! Put her in jail! We can＊t quite put our fingers on it, but the words sure do make a lot of people feel better, so they must be right. \nSo that＊s the take of Berkley linguistics professor Robin Lakoff. Now here＊s the take from Charles S. Faddis, a former CIA operations officer with 20 years of experience in intelligence operations. \nAs Mr. Faddis writes   I have worked in national security my entire life. Most of that has been in the intelligence community surrounded by   For twenty years, I worked undercover in the Central Intelligence Agency, recruiting sources, producing intelligence and running operations. I have a pretty concrete understanding of how classified information is handled and how government communications systems work. Nobody uses a private email server for official business. Period. Full stop. \nThe entire notion is, to borrow a phrase from a Clinton campaign official, ※insane.§ That anyone would presume to be allowed to do so is mind-boggling. That government officials allowed Hillary Clinton to do so is nauseating. Classified and unclassified information do not mix. They don＊t travel in the same streams through the same pipes. They move in clearly well defined channels so that never the twain shall meet. Mixing them together is unheard of and a major criminal offense. If you end up with classified information in an unclassified channel, you have done something very wrong and very serious. Accidentally removing a single classified message from controlled spaces, without any evidence of intent or exposure to hostile forces, can get you fired and cost you your clearance. Repeated instances will land you in prison. Every hostile intelligence agency on the planet targets senior American officials for collection. The Secretary of State tops the list. Almost anything the Secretary of State had to say about her official duties, her schedule, her mood, her plans for the weekend, would be prized information to adversaries. It is very difficult, in fact, to think of much of anything that the Secretary of State could be saying in email that we would want hostile forces to know. As we wait for more information on the latest revelations, let＊s quickly note what we already know Hillary Clinton did. While Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton exclusively used a private email address for official business. Instead of using a State Department account, she used a personal email account, housed on a private server located in her home in Chappaqua, New York. The Department of State exercised zero control or oversight in this process. No government security personnel were involved in protecting them. When the House Select Committee on Benghazi asked to see these emails, the Department of State said they did not have them. Clinton＊s lawyers then went through all the emails on her server. They turned over 30,000 emails they decided were work related and deleted all of the rest. How they made the decision as to which emails to share and which to destroy remains unknown. Active government officials were not involved in this process. Hillary says she did not use the account to transmit   This has been proven false. The FBI found over 100 messages that contained information that was classified when sent, including numerous email chains at the level of Top Secret/Special Access Programs. They don＊t get any more highly classified, it＊s the virtual summit of Mt. Everest. One theme pertained to the movement of North Korean nuclear assets obtained via satellite imagery . It doesn＊t take a rocket scientist to figure out this is extremely sensitive information. The FBI found another 2,000 messages containing information that should have been classified at the time it was sent. How much more classified information may have been in the tens of thousands of emails, which Clinton＊s lawyers erased, is completely unknown. Hillary Clinton supporters like to ask rhetorically, ※Well, what about Colin Powell?§ Nice try , but using your own private email address which received 2 emails determined to be classified later, is nothing like deliberately operating a home brewed server, and then see it handle thousands of classified e-mails. \nWhat happens next we do not know. What we do know already is this. While serving in one of the most senior positions in the United States Government, Hillary Clinton was at a minimum, grossly negligent in the handling of classified information and when confronted with this practice, acted immediately to destroy information and prevent a full, fair and complete investigation of any damage to national security. Anyone else who did such things in the government would long ago have been tried, convicted and sent to jail. You decide if you want to send her to the White House instead. \nI＊ll let readers decide who has a better read on the situation. In the meantime, back to your safe spaces my little snowflakes.

    "title": "Here＊s What Happened When a Hillary Supporting MIT Professor Decided to Analyze Her Emails＃",
    "text": "A few days ago, Cesar A. Hidalgo published a very important article titled, What I Learned From Visualizing Hillary Clinton＊s Emails . \nSo who is Cesar Hidalgo? \nC谷sar A. Hidalgo is associate professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab and the author of Why Information Grows: The evolution of order from atoms to economies . He has also lead the creation of data visualization sites that have received more than 100 million views, including datausa.io, dataviva.info, atlas.media.mit.edu, immersion.media.mit.edu, pantheon.media.mit.edu, streetscore.media.mit.edu, and others (see chidalgo.com for more details). \nAt this point, I＊m sure you＊re wondering why I＊m highlighting this guy＊s post two days before the Presidential election. It＊s for two reasons. First, the piece offers a very good representation of the sort of peer pressure that can come down upon an academic for being seen as having the ※wrong§ political opinion. Second, and perhaps most important, his email visualization tool taught him that the current state of our government in these United States simply can＊t achieve the best outcomes for the public at current scale (size, geographic/cultural diversity, etc). \nWith all that out of the way, I＊m going to highlight what I found to be the most powerful part of his piece. \nEnjoy: So what did we learn by making this dataset accessible? We learned a few things about what Clinton＊s emails said, about how the media works, and about how people interpreted the project. We made clinton.media.mit.edu publicly available last Friday night (October 28, 2016). We launched with a single story , written by Alejandra Vargas from Univision. My intuition was that the story was likely to get picked up by other news sources. After all, the tool facilitated people＊s ability to read and understand the content of these emails, and the connections of the people involved in them. But I was wrong〞it has been nearly a week since we released the project and no other major news source has picked up the story, despite having been viewed by more than 300,000 people in less than a week. So how did we get so much traffic without any news coverage? The answer is social media. So far, the tool has been shared widely on Twitter, Facebook, and for a brief but intense time, on Reddit. Its spread has been fueled by different motives, and also, has been battled in different ways. Many reporters shared the news on their personal accounts understanding that the tool represents a different form of data reporting, or data journalism: one where people are provided with a tool that facilitates their ability to explore a relevant dataset, instead of being provided with a story summarizing a reporter＊s description of that dataset. Another group of people that shared the news were interface designers, who understand that there is a need to improve the tabular interface of present day email clients, and that the inbox we presented in this project was an attractive new alternative. But many people also shared our site claiming that this was evidence of Clinton＊s corruption, and that the site supported Trump. More on that later. But the spread of the site was not without its detractors. A few hours after we released the site I received a message from a friend telling me that what I had done was ※a huge mistake§ and that I should have waited to post this until ※later in the year.§ A few days later, outside my lab, a member of a neighboring research group called me a ※Trump supporter§ and told me that I should have only made that site available if it also included Trump＊s emails. I told him that I would be happy to include them, but I had no access to the data. In haste, this colleague began emailing me news articles, none of which provided access to the alleged public dataset of Trump emails. Later, a friend of one of my students posted the news on Reddit, where it went viral. And I mean really viral. It became the top story of the Internetisbeautiful subreddit, and made it to Reddit＊s front page. It collected more than 3,000 upvotes and 700 comments. But as the story peaked, a moderator single-handedly removed it in an authoritarian move, and justified this unilateral silencing of the post by adding a rule banning ※sites that serve a political agenda or that otherwise induce drama.§ Of course, the rule was added AFTER the post was removed. Reddit appears to be rampant with censorship these days. So when it comes to media, social or not, I learned that providing information directly to people so that they can inspect it and evaluate it, is a value that many people consider second to supporting their preferred electoral choice. The twist is that I don＊t support Trump. In fact, I don＊t support him at all. I think he is potentially a threat to global security, and also, a candidate that has shown repeatedly to be a dividing rather than unifying force. He has failed to respect contracts numerous times, defrauding contractors; and he certainly has shown little respect for people＊s development by creating a fraudulent university. So I think he is ill prepared for most jobs, including a difficult one like that of being president. I support Clinton in this election, and even though I don＊t get to vote (As a green card holder I just pay taxes), I want her to win next Tuesday. I really do. But I understand that this is my own personal choice, a choice that I want to make sure is informed by my ability to evaluate information about the candidates directly, and by a media that is more transparent than the one we now have. Trust me, if I had Trump＊s tax records, I would also think it is a good idea to make a tool that makes them more easily digestible. But my reason to make that tool, once again, would not come from my support for Clinton, or my opposition to Trump. It would come from my support for a society where people have direct access to relevant sources of information through well-designed data visualization tools. Now here＊s where we get into very important lessons about the future. So what did I learn about Clinton＊s emails? One of the advantages of helping design a data visualization tool is that you get an intimate understanding of the data you are visualizing. After all, you have to explore the data and use the tool to make dozens of design decisions. In this case, the development cycle was particularly fast, but nevertheless I got to learn a few things about the data. Of course, the whole point of making this tool is that you can use it to come up with your own interpretation of the data. That said, you might be curious about mine, so I＊ll share it with you too. What I saw on Clinton＊s emails was not surprising to me. It involved a relatively small group of people talking about what language to use when communicating with other people. Also, it involved many unresponded-to emails. Many conversations revolved around what words to use or avoid, and what topics to focus on, or how to avoid some topics, when speaking in public or in meetings. This is not surprising to me because I＊ve met many politicians in my life, including a few presidents and dozens of ministers and governors, so I know that what work means to many people in this line of work, on a daily basis, is strategizing what to say and being careful about how to say it. I am sure that if we had access to Trump＊s emails we would see plenty of the same behavior. So what I got from reading some of Clinton＊s email is another piece of evidence confirming my intuition that political systems scale poorly. The most influential actors on them are spending a substantial fraction of their mental capacity thinking about how to communicate, and do not have the bandwidth needed to deal with many incoming messages (the unresponded-to emails). This is not surprising considering the large number of people they interact with (although this dataset is rather small. I send 8k emails a year and receive 30k. In this dataset Clinton is sending only 2K emails a year). Our modern political world is one where a few need to interact with many, so they have no time for deep relationships?〞?they physically cannot. So what we are left is with a world of first impressions and public opinion, where the choice of words matters enormously, and becomes central to the job. Yet, the chronic lack of time that comes from having a system where few people govern many, and that leads people to strategize every word, is not Clinton＊s fault. It is just a bug that affects all modern political systems, which are ancient Greek democracies that were not designed to deal with hundreds of millions of people. On another note, this exercise also helped me reaffirm my belief that the best way to learn about the media is not by reading the news, but by being news. I＊ve had the fortune, and misfortune, to have been news many times. This time, I honestly thought that we had a piece of content that some media channels would be interested in and that it would get picked up easily. I have many reporter friends who are enthusiastic about new forms of data journalism, and that actually have been positive and encouraging this week. So I imagined that there was a good chance that a reporter would see the site, go to his or her editor, and say: ※Hey, I have an interactive data visualization of all Clinton＊s emails. Can I write a story on it?§ and the editor would say: ※Of course, make it quick.§ I don＊t know if these conversations actually happened, but given the large volume of traffic our project received I would be surprised if they didn＊t. I learned that the outcome was not the one I intuited. And this brings me to my final point, which is that while I support Clinton in this election, and I think Trump is a bad choice for president (a really bad one), I still think that we should work on the creation of tools that improve the ability of people to personalize scrutinize politically relevant information. I now understand that much of the U.S. media may not share that view with me, and that I think this is an important point of reflection. I hope the media takes some time to think about this on November 9 (or the week after). Also, the large number of people who were unable to interpret our tool as anything but an effort to support or oppose a political candidate?〞?and that was true for both liberals and conservatives?〞?speaks to me about an ineffective public sphere. And that＊s something I think we should all be concerned about. This polarization is not just a clich谷. It is a crippling societal condition that is expressed in the inability of people to see any merit, or any point, in opposing views. That＊s a dangerous, and chronic, institutional disease that is expressed also in the inability of people to criticize their own candidates, because they fear being confused with someone their peers will interpret as a supporter of the opposing candidate. If you cannot see any merit in the candidate you oppose, even in one or two of the many points that have been made, you may have it. So that＊s how this election has muddled the gears of democracy. When we cannot learn from those we oppose, or agree when they have a valid point, our learning stops. We keep on talking past each other. I know that this election has made learning from those we oppose particularly difficult, but the difficult tests are the ones that truly show us what we are really made of. These are the situations that push us to see past all of the things that we don＊t like, or don＊t agree on, so we can rescue a lesson. You may not agree with me, but I hope at least I gave you something to think about. While his points about media censorship and peer pressure are self-explanatory, I want to take a quick moment to discuss his most meaningful insight, which is the idea that ※ political systems scale poorly.§ This is hugely important, because as the current status quo system collapses, many of us in the Western world will be presented with an incredible opportunity to do things completely different. Unfortunately, none of the candidates in the 2016 election (including Sanders and Trump) have been promoting the idea of political decentralization, which is the direction I think we need to move toward. In voting for Brexit, that＊s exactly what the British people professed a preference for, and it＊s what we need here in America. In some important ways, I think we should look back toward the original concept of government as understood by our founders. A loose-knit collection of largely self-governing states that are bonded together in certain important ways, yet independent and sovereign in all other ways. Indeed, I think we can break things up even further than that, but let＊s start there for the time being. If we want to stick with representative democracy, I think for it to work best, it needs to be very local. I think the future of mankind depends on us getting our political systems right, and I think governance has to be shifted to the local level as much as possible. This all reminds me of Aldous Huxley＊s extremely prescient warning in his 1958 book Brave New World revised (see my review of it), in which he wrote: \nOr take the right to vote. In principle, it is a great privilege. In practice, as recent history has repeatedly shown, the right to vote, by itself, is no guarantee of liberty. Therefore, if you wish to avoid dictatorship by referendum, break up modern society＊s merely functional collectives into self-governing, voluntarily co-operating groups, capable of functioning outside the bureaucratic systems of Big Business and Big Government. Bottom line: We need to decentralize everything, especially government. In Liberty,",

    "title": "Hillary Literally Became the Definition of ＆Pathological Lying＊ on Google Yesterday",
    "text": "( ANTIMEDIA ) If you had happened to Google the term ＆pathological lying＊ on Sunday evening, you would have been met with none other than the bright, smiling face of presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. Before Wikipedia administrators put a temporary lock on the entry early Monday morning, the top Google result for the term was a link to the Wiki article displaying Clinton＊s photo, along with the following quote defining pathological lying:\n\n※It is a stand-alone disorder as well as a symptom of other disorders such as psychopathy and antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders, but people who are pathological liars may not possess characteristics of the other disorders. Excessive lying is a common symptom of several mental disorders.§ \nThe revision history of the entry shows the picture of Clinton was originally added to the ＆pathological lying＊ Wikipedia article on the morning of October 29th, but it wasn＊t until the next night that the ever-vigilant internet community took notice and excitedly spread the word on Facebook and Twitter . Check out the Google Trends report for ＆pathological lying＊ below:\n\nUnsurprisingly, most reactions were supportive of the alteration to the Wikipedia article, once again showing the public＊s general distrust of the presidential candidate. A poll conducted by Quinnipiac University last year asked voters to say the first thing that came to mind when they thought of Hillary Clinton. The most popular response was ※liar,§ followed by ※dishonest§ and ※untrustworthy.§ Maybe if the biggest names in journalism weren＊t outright colluding with Hillary＊s campaign , that poll would have been more widely reported. Maybe.\nDue to the fact major media corporations are completely ignoring the corruption surrounding the Clinton campaign, it has been left to Wikileaks, independent media outlets, and the social media community to push this information into the public eye. Just a week away from the election, new evidence was discovered that prompted the FBI to announce they have reopened the criminal investigation into Hillary＊s private email server.\nWith Republican nominee Donald Trump scheduled to appear in court to face rape allegations, there is a high possibility the next president of the United States will be facing criminal charges before they＊re even inaugurated. If nothing else, this election cycle is proving that people want truth 〞 and they＊ll get creative to expose it.\nCourtesy post via Josie Wales and theAntiMedia.org.",

    "text": "I＊m running on about an hour and a half of sleep and my nails are damn near chewed to the bone. This because, as a diehard Cubs fan, I was up until nearly 1:00 AM working to come to grips with what I had just witnessed. Once I finally went to bed I found myself tossing and turning so at 3:30 I said screw it＃ I＊m heading to the office.\nMy beloved Cubbies had just won the World Series, defeating the Cleveland Indians in what is likely to go down as one of the most EPIC game 7 battles in the history of professional baseball. The Cubs haven＊t won a World Series since 1908, making this Championship something we Cubs fans could only dream about until it actually happened last night.\nAs prediction hub FiveThirtyEight put it just a few days ago＃ the chances were slim. How slim? Slimmer than the odds of Trump winning next Tuesday.\n\nAn impossible scenario just become very possible. And fortunately for America, another seemingly impossible scenario is now suddenly started to look very possible.\nA Hillary Clinton indictment is now likely .\nThis coming via FBI sources telling Fox News host Bret Baier that the FBI is moving towards what is ※likely an indictment.§\nBaier＊s report includes the following key points .\n1. The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year.\n2. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time.\n3. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton＊s secret server on Anthony Weiner＊s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature.\n4. Sources within the FBI have told him that an indictment is ※likely§ in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, ※barring some obstruction in some way§ from the Justice Department.\n5. FBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary Clinton＊s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information had been taken from it.\nThat＊s a pretty strong case for indictment. Of course, the corrupted DOJ can still do everything in its power to block justice, but it now appears the FBI is throwing DOJ demands out the window.\nGonna be an interesting few days ahead, folks. For those of us who are Cubs fans and news junkies sleep is not on the agenda.",

    "text": "This is not a close call.\nIt is not a judgement call.\nIt is not subject to interpretation.\nIt is a flat-out criminal offense. \nAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton routinely asked her maid to print out sensitive government e-mails and documents 〞 including ones containing classified information 〞 from her house in Washington, DC, e-mails and FBI memos show. But the housekeeper lacked the security clearance to handle such material.\nIn fact, Marina Santos was called on so frequently to receive e-mails that she may hold the secrets to E-mailgate 〞 if only the FBI and Congress would subpoena her and the equipment she used.\nIt is a crime to knowingly, say much less intentionally, give access to classified information to someone who is not cleared to receive and handle it.\nSantos also had access to a highly secure room called an SCIF (sensitive compartmented information facility) that diplomatic security agents set up at Whitehaven, according to FBI notes from an interview with Abedin.\nFrom within the SCIF, Santos 〞 who had no clearance 〞 ※collected documents from the secure facsimile machine for Clinton,§ the FBI notes revealed.\nJust how sensitive were the papers Santos presumably handled? The FBI noted Clinton periodically received the Presidential Daily Brief 〞 a top-secret document prepared by the CIA and other US intelligence agencies 〞 via the secure fax. \nThis is a second and even more serious federal crime. \nThe PDB is one of the most-seriously classified (top secret) documents routinely prepared for the President; it contains up to the minute information relating to various events and activities all over the world.\nIt is also a crime to allow, through negligence or worse, intentional act, someone who is not cleared to have access to a SCIF.\nThere is no possible argument that Hillary can raise of ※retroactive§ classification; that is, material that wasn＊t classified at the time she handed it, when it comes to the PDB since those are always classified.\nThat the FBI knew about this months ago, which is now a documented fact, and did not demand that Hillary be charged with myriad federal offenses related to said intentional and knowing conduct that threatened our national security is an outrage.\nThe FBI has now proved that it is not a law enforcement agency but in fact it is a rogue band of armed thugs acting in direct support of a person who they know has repeatedly and willingly, on a daily basis, violated long-standing Federal Law and in fact have documented in writing that she violated those laws and yet they have intentionally and knowingly refused to act to bring her to justice .\nThe FBI has documented in its own writing that it is an equally-guilty party to Hillary Clinton＊s willful and intentional violation of federal law as it pertains to the handling of classified information on a literal daily basis and thus can no longer be treated as a legitimate law enforcement or investigative agency by the people of the United States.\nIt does not matter what James Comey says; we are supposed to be a nation of laws and our Constitutional Republican form of government demands nothing less. When you declare a willingness to allow someone to violate the law with impunity you, and everyone who allows you in that position of authority to do so stand with them and in direct opposition to the Constitution of the United States. \nOriginally posted at Market Ticker .",

    "title": "Hillary＊s definition of a conspiracy theorist: anyone who doesn＊t believe her lies",
    "text": "Print \nWatching Hillary Clinton run from a hardball question like a roach from Raid should give every American a sense of satisfaction. When a reporter asked the former secretary of state about the Project Veritas undercover videos , which featured disgraced former Democratic operatives Scott Foval and Bob Creamer bragging about provoking violence at Trump rallies and perpetrating mass voter fraud, Clinton panicked and pulled the plug on the entire press conference. ※I know nothing about this,§ said Clinton. ※I＊m not 〞 I can＊t deal with every one of [James O＊Keefe＊s] conspiracy theories but I hope you all have something to eat and something to drink on the way back to New York. Thank you!§ \nConspiracy theories? Was she really trying to imply that videotaped confessions from two of her surrogates amount to a ※conspiracy theory?§ Yes, she was. It＊s become something of a habit for her 〞 every time Hillary wants to deny plain facts she calls them a ※conspiracy theory§ 〞 which is quite delicious coming from Ms. ※Vast Rightwing Conspiracy§ herself. \nTo call something a ※conspiracy theory§ doesn＊t reveal much about its validity. Of course, some conspiracy theories are legitimately kooky. Tune in to Coast to Coast AM for a while to see what I＊m talking about, or listen to Jesse Ventura expound on secret US government weather control machines in Alaska. Most of these loony conspiracy theories originate on the political Left, by the way, such as the assertion that Lee Harvey Oswald was ※sheep-dipped§ to look like a communist so that JFK＊s real capitalist/imperialist murderers could make a clean getaway. \nBut other conspiracy theories are at least plausible. Whenever two or more people plot in secret, that＊s a conspiracy. Anyone who suspects that a conspiracy＊s afoot is by definition a conspiracy theorist. If you come home from vacation to find a car parked on your lawn and the back yard strewn with red Solo cups, you might suspect that your teenaged sons conspired to throw a raging party. That＊s a conspiracy theory. Watergate was a conspiracy among at least the four burglars. The ensuing coverup was a conspiracy that reached all the way up to the president. Watergate has been proven to most people＊s satisfaction so we don＊t think of it as a ※theory§ anymore, but there was a time, in the nascent stages of the investigation, when the whole picture was not yet known. In other words, it was a conspiracy theory 〞 and yet it turned out to be true. \nHillary Clinton employs the term ※conspiracy theory§ because of its derisive connotation. What she means by it is that a certain accusation 〞 in this case that her campaign has engaged in illegal election tampering 〞 is so absurd that it would be a waste of her time to respond. It＊s crazy talk . File it over there with alien abductions and Illuminati shadow governments. \nUnfortunately for Hillary, the ※conspiracy theory§ alleged by Project Veritas happens to be very credible. Just listen to Democratic operative Scott Foval＊s videotaped confession: \nWe＊ve been busing people in to deal with you f***ing assholes [Republicans] for fifty years and we＊re not going to stop now. We＊re just going to find a different way to do it. \nFoval＊s ※different way§ is using rental cars rather than buses to get impostors from polling place to polling place on election day. That＊s a conspiracy theory for sure but not an unreasonable one. It＊s the same old shenanigans Democrats have been pulling since the heyday of Tammany Hall. Lying, cheating, and ballot box-stuffing 〞 it＊s what Democrats do. Richard Daley did it in Chicago, Lyndon Johnson did it in Texas, and Hillary Clinton＊s doing it nationwide. \nHillary Clinton and her media sycophants have gotten a lot of mileage out of the ※conspiracy theory§ dodge this election season. When Mrs. Clinton was haunted by persistent rumors of ill health, the media countered them with accusations of conspiratorial thinking. In a column conveniently titled ※Can We Just Stop Talking About Hillary Clinton＊s Health Now?§ the Washington Post＊s Chris Cillizza wrote : \nBeyond the Clinton conspiracy theorists who believe she had something to do with Vince Foster＊s death and that she was secretly responsible for everything from Y2K to the SpaceX explosion last week, it＊s hard to plausibly insist, based on the available data, that Clinton is ill. \nHuffPo contributor Melissa Jeltsen went even further, blaming both conspiratorial thinking and 〞 you guess it! 〞 bigotry : ※Let＊s get real: The wild conspiracy theories around Clinton＊s health are a convenient way to mask misogyny inside ＆legitimate＊ medical concerns.§ \nAs it turns out, those ※conspiracy theories§ weren＊t so ※wild§ after all. Hillary Clinton later collapsed after a 9/11 memorial service but refused to go to the hospital for fear that her critics would be proven right. Thank goodness for camera phones 〞 if the incident hadn＊t been recorded, Hillary would be claiming that it never happened while maligning anyone who said otherwise as a nutty conspiracy theorist 〞 and the press would be helping her. After the incident, Clinton admitted (or ※admitted§) that she was stricken with walking pneumonia, a conveniently transitory illness. If you suspect that she suffers from a more permanent medical condition you＊re probably a ※conspiracy theorist.§ It＊s becoming painfully obvious that Hillary Clinton＊s definition of a ※conspiracy theory§ is anything that contradicts her lies. \nThe ※conspiracy theorist§ epithet has become the media＊s lazy retort to every possible attack on their candidate 〞 and make no mistake about it, she is their candidate. Earlier this month, CNN contributor Jackie Kucinich dismissed talk of Bill Clinton＊s sexual assaults on various women as ※conspiracy theory land,§ which is frankly outrageous. Bill＊s accusers form a line around the block, almost as long as Bill Cosby＊s. We know at very least that he＊s a sexual harasser and, if the most serious accusations lodged against him are true, a rapist as well. He has a track record that simply cannot be denied. Oddly enough this ※conspiracy theory§ would actually be a conspiracy theory if, as Kucinich implies, the accusers were lying because it would imply some shadowy group working behind the scenes to smear Bill Clinton with an endless barrage of slander. The simpler, non-conspiratorial explanation is just that Bill is a horndog off his leash. \nJackie Kucinich is in fact a bona fide member of her own little conspiracy. In April 2015, the Clinton campaign held an ※off the record§ cocktail party with friendly reporters hosted at the Manhattan home of prominent Clinton supporter Joel Benenson. Among those journalists (if you can call them that) was Jackie Kucinich. According to a hacked email: \nMuch of the group consists of influential reporters, anchors, and editors. The goals of the dinner include: (1) Giving reporters their first thoughts from team HRC in advance of the announcement (2) Setting expectations for the announcement and launch period (3) Framing the HRC message and framing the race (4) Enjoying a Frida[y] night drink before working more. [Emphasis added.] \nWhile many reporters on the list have impotently protested that their presence at the event does not amount to media coordination with a campaign, it＊s hard to make the case that Kucinich is not a Clinton lackey after she spouted Clinton campaign talking points about Bill＊s predatory nature on national television. It takes a certain gall for Kucinich, one of Hillary Clinton＊s known co-conspirators, to go on television and whine about ※conspiracy theories.§ \nNearly everyone on earth harbors ※conspiracy theories§ because conspiracies really do happen. Most people, however, prefer not to think of their own conspiracy theories as such because of the negative connotation associated with the term. Some conspiracy theories are downright silly but others are quite plausible. There are enough real conspiracies in the world to concentrate on the ones that are reasonably substantiated, such as Hillary Clinton＊s coordination with dirty tricksters Foval and Creamer. As the conspiracy theory television program The X-Files used to say, ※The Truth Is Out There.§ Don＊t be afraid to pursue it.",

    "text": "Print \nFor thos who stubbornly insist that the words election and rig have never been uttered in the same sentence by wannabe president Hillary Clinton, here＊s a little sound bite you might have trouble making sense of. \nThe recording was made on September 5, 2006, by an editor of the ※Jewish Press,§ during a meeting with Clinton in her race for re-election to the U.S. Senator. \nVia The Observer : \nThe tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to [Editor Eli] Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. \n[＃] \nSpeaking ＃ about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). \nIn the clip, which appears below, Clinton can be heard plainly saying: \nI do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.",

    "text": "0 \nHillary Clinton has barely just lost the presidential election and here she is already getting herself caught in another one of her tangled web of lies. \nThe day after losing, a picture was posted of her taking her dog out for a walk. The picture was reportedly from a random hiker she ran into and showed that she was getting back to public life, or that＊s what she wants you to believe. \nNow, I want you to do me a favor and take a very close look at this picture, specifically the ※hiker§ she met. Memorize her face＃ \nGot it? Okay, good. \nNow what I am about to show you is something Hillary Clinton was hoping nobody else would notice. Tell me if the girl in the 2nd picture, taken in the 2000＊s, reminds you of anyone: \nYeah, it is the EXACT SAME GIRL! \nHer name is Margot Gerster and her mother just happens to be one of the big fundraisers for Hillary. That＊s actually where the older picture was taken. \nWow! That doesn＊t seem random at all, does it? \nIt looks like this is yet another example of Hillary Clinton trying to mislead the public using her inner circle and pretending like she doesn＊t know them. \nAll I gotta say is, give it the Hell up, Hillary! You lost, nobody needs to see your ※chance encounters§ or other promotional propaganda anymore. This is exactly why Americans ended up hating you! \nOh well, I guess you really cannot teach an old dog new tricks. Well, in that case all that＊s left to do is share this all across Facebook and the internet and expose yet another one of her Serial Lies!",

    "title": "LEAKED: Hillary Would Completely BAN The Most Popular Guns In America",
    "text": "Share This \nThere are so many reasons Americans should not vote for Hillary Clinton, but one of those reasons is this woman＊s tyrannical plans to strip us of our Second Amendment rights. What many people do not realize is that if she becomes president, Hillary would ban many of our favorite guns, as revealed in a bombshell report that was just leaked. \nIn a recent WikiLeaks dump, we got an inside glimpse into Hillary＊s diabolical plans to trample all over our gun rights if she becomes president. If you thought Obama＊s tyranny with bypassing Congress and enacting his will via executive orders was obnoxious, it won＊t hold a candle to this woman＊s plans. She blatantly expressed how she would impose massive gun control through executive fiat in a manner ※more aggressive than Obama,§ while chipping away at our Second Amendment with a myriad of new regulations and gun laws. \nWhile Hillary likes to pump us full of crap, claiming that ※law-abiding Americans wouldn＊t be targeted§ with her tyranny, her broad and evasive gun control measures would directly affect Americans with no criminal records, while having zero impact on the behavior of violent criminals. \nOne example is Hillary calling for the ※reinstatement of the national assault weapons ban and a prohibition on high-capacity magazines.§ However, the result of her ※assault weapons§ ban would essentially take up a massive category of firearms, including the popular AR-15, while making ※high capacity§ magazines illegal to even possess. \nWe all know these types of regulations are completely ineffective in preventing gun violence since criminals have no regard for laws in the first place and are obviously not going to turn over their guns just because Hillary decides to pass a law. \nHer other Constitution-subverting plan is to pass a law making it legal for ※victims of gun violence§ to sue gun manufacturers, which would quickly bankrupt these companies. However, Hillary＊s ultimate goal is to ban all guns in America completely by utilizing the Supreme Court. With her hand-picked justice filling Antonin Scalia＊s vacancy, she would have the SCOTUS revisit the District of Columbia v Heller (2008) ruling. If successful, the court would eliminate it＊s previous affirmation that it is an individual＊s Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. \nWhen you put all the pieces together, Hillary＊s plans for America is nothing short of chilling. History taught us the brutal lesson about what happens when a populace is unarmed 〞 images of corpses from Nazi concentration camps come to mind. Add Hillary＊s gun-grabbing plan to her dream of turning America into a borderless society and flooding our country with Muslim refugees, and you have the perfect recipe for disaster. \nGod help us if this woman is elected. Continue to share stories like this and tirelessly work to expose this woman before election day. Once she＊s in office, the America that we know and love will be drastically transformed into a third-world country crap hole, and Hillary＊s life-long plans will be complete.",

    "text": "Hillary＊s Bizarre Spanish Birthday Bash, Tells Illegal Aliens SECRET Message Posted on October 26, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics Share This \nIt＊s Hillary Clinton＊s birthday, and unfortunately, no one is shocked that she spent time on Univision on some ridiculous talk show, pandering to illegal aliens during a bizarre Spanish birthday bash. However, what is leaving many in disbelief is what she promised illegal aliens off the record if she gets elected. Unfortunately for her, Univision let everyone know her secret message to them, and it＊s pissing Americans off. Hillary＊s birthday cake (left), Hillary samples cookies (right) \nHillary is on her final leg of her ill-fated campaign, and it＊s perfect that she showed her true colors on Univision＊s Spanish-language talk show called ※Gordo & Flaca§ (Fat & Skinny) with a little person called Producer Carlitos who led Hillary around like a pet pony. It was so pathetic as they made her repeat words like ※vote§ and ※president§ in Spanish while the crowd laughed at her bad accent. \nIt＊s cringe-worthy enough when a 69-year-old grandmother panders to a bunch of buffoons in any language, but the fact that it was an American woman running for president makes it disgusting. However, let＊s look past the idiotic looking birthday cake coming from what is supposed to be an unbiased news source, albeit a Hispanic one. Instead, let＊s learn what Hillary said directly to illegal aliens that have so many Americans pissed off today. It＊s Hillary pandering at her best, or it＊s the worst optic ever, and she should have canceled. ※I want to be a really good president for you,§ she said in one outtake posted by the show online. ※I want to give you every opportunity to be successful in our country.§ Clinton announced a free concert Saturday with latin pop stars Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. [via Daily Mail ] Did you catch that? Hillary wants to give illegal aliens every opportunity to be successful in our country, and this was an outtake because her campaign wanted none of that talk to get posted online. Hillary is struggling badly with the heavily Cuban areas in Florida, where they routinely vote Republican, and the one thing she needs is Florida. At the end of this one minute video, you can hear Hillary say to Gordo (Fatty), ※ You＊ll make the difference not just here in Florida , but everywhere.§ The Cuban-Americans don＊t take kindly to illegal aliens of any race, so where they might watch Univision, they will not like Hillary looking ridiculous, and they will especially not like her encouraging illegal aliens in that message that was supposed to be off the record. Now for the other stupid Hillary moment, which was another bad optic for her. Producer Carlitos gave Hillary an expensive bottle of tequila as Hillary looked all bugged eyed wanting to down a shot. Producer Carlitos led Hillary like a pet pony onto the stage (left), Carlitos gave Hillary tequila (right) The path to Hillary＊s White House runs through non-white voters. Think about that. Yes, America is a melting pot, but we want a legal melting pot. Wanting those in America to actually be legal Americans isn＊t racist since ※illegal§ isn＊t a race. What Donald Trump said was that it＊s okay to be proud to be American. In fact, it＊s vital we be proud to be Americans once again 〞 and all races in the United States can and should feel that way. Hillary needs to pander to those minorities who, unlike Cuban-Americans, believe illegal aliens have the same rights in America as Americans . It＊s crazy and proves that Hillary cares nothing about America. She is a pure globalist, who is working for those who want open borders everywhere. I truly believe that Americans are smarter than Hillary and her cabal of globalists know. Let those at Univision and those who hate America get this message loud and clear: America is not Hillary＊s country to give away. It＊s every Americans＊ country, and we each have one vote to make sure she can never give our birthright away.",

    "text": "Insider Leaks Bill＊s 2-Word Nickname For Hillary, Exposes Dirty Sex Habits Posted on October 26, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This \nBill and Hillary Clinton just can＊t stay out of the spotlight these days, and the most recent leak about them could be the most damaging yet. As it turns out, someone once close to the duo just came forward to share Bill＊s revealing nickname for his wife 〞 but the worse comes as their dirty bedroom habits were exposed. Bill and Hillary Clinton (left), Photoshopped image of Hillary (right) \nIt＊s no mystery that Bill Clinton is a sexual deviant, but the most recent account given by the woman who had a 3-decade affair with the man is damning, to say the least. According to an exclusive interview given to Mail Online , Dolly Kyle was behind the scene＊s long enough to not only know the two＊s darkest secrets but even their dirty sexual habits 每 and now, she＊s telling everyone. \nThe connection between Dolly and Bill began when she was just 11-years-old. He was about 13-years-old at the time, but Dolly states that there was an immediate attraction, even then. As the years progressed, the two became romantically involved and stayed that way through several of their marriages over the next 30 years. Dolly Kyle (Source: Mail Online ) \nThe real affair began in 1974 just after Dolly divorced her first husband, and although Bill wasn＊t married yet, he would be within the year. Although she was never interested in sharing the intimate details of the relationship, she states that she snapped when she heard Hillary recently say that all sexual assault victims have the ※right to be believed.§ \nKnowing full well just what Hillary had done 每 between the threats and the lies 每 to the many women who either had an affair with or were sexually assaulted by her husband Bill, Dolly knew she had to do something about it. Unfortunately for Hillary, Dolly is now coming forward with the dirty 2-word nickname Bill husband once called Hillary, among other things. \nAccording to Mail Online , Bill approached Dolly at their high school＊s 35-year reunion to talk about ※ the warden § 每 a.k.a. Hillary. Saying he was unhappy with his life and marriage, this was the least significant account Dolly had to share. A very unhappy Bill and ※the warden§ Hillary Clinton (Source: Mail Online ) \nIn fact, Dolly recalls that Bill mentioned something about having a baby to her. Although she thought he was saying he wanted to have one with her, he was actually talking about Hillary. He wanted to put to bed the rumors that Hillary was a lesbian, even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true. \nDolly states that the worst came when she met Hillary for the first time. ※In that moment I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering [body] odor of perspiration and greasy hair. I hoped that I wouldn＊t gag when she got in my car,§ she said. ※The sandal-shod woman with lank, smelly hair stood off to the side and glared at everyone.§ Bill and Hillary Clinton (Source: Mail Online ) \nNo wonder Bill went elsewhere to fulfill his ※sexual addiction,§ as Dolly referred to it. After all, what else can you do when you＊re married to a stinky woman who doesn＊t shower and isn＊t attracted to men anyways? Although an affair is never justified, it＊s easy to sympathize with Bill on this one. But, I digress. \nThe bigger point here is what the two are willing to do in order to remain in power. Most people know that you can＊t trust Hillary as far as you can throw her 每 which isn＊t very far 每 so the fact that she has any supporters is beyond baffling at this point. This woman is corrupt and fake to the core. Let＊s just hope all of America wakes up to this reality before it＊s too late and she can do any more damage than she already has.",

    "text": "Criminal Minions CAUGHT Pushing Voter Fraud To Get Hillary Elected Posted on October 26, 2016 by Shae Weatherall in Politics Share This \nThere isn＊t anything that Hillary Clinton supporters won＊t stoop to do or say in order to get their candidate elected. We＊ve seen massive amounts of corruption involving every level of Hillary＊s minions all the way up to the Chair of the Democratic National Committee. Apparently, nothing is off limits when they＊re doing Hillary＊s bidding, and now they have a new racket that is going to make criminal voter fraud a whole lot easier. \nElection fraud has already become a big concern again this election cycle as voting machines are reportedly ※malfunctioning§ and switching votes in favor of Hillary. One Texas county was even forced to abandon the machines altogether and go to paper ballots. \nThere has been some progress in protecting the integrity of our elections by implementing voter ID laws, but Democrats have been fighting it tooth and nail. Hillary and her minions claim that it＊s racist or oppressive or some crap to expect United States citizens to possess and show picture ID to vote. It＊s apparently not a problem, though, to ask them to show ID for a pack of cigarettes or to board a plane or for a hundred other things. Go figure. \nEven as they were whining about how requiring photo identification to vote is oppression, Hillary＊s minions were already working on a solution. They knew there was a good chance they would lose the fight against states who wanted to stop dead ※Democrats§ from voting, and so now, we＊re seeing the Hillary supporters＊ machine at work. \nHillary＊s minions have taken to the internet to advertise and sell near-perfect replicas of state driver＊s licenses. According to an ad on craigslist which has now been removed, the entire purpose of purchasing one of the fake ID＊s is specifically to fraudulently vote for Hillary Clinton . \nThe text on the ad reads: ※ I can provide you with a high-quality fake ID it comes with holographic and also barcode [sic]. This can be used anywhere, we are offering special deals for people who will go to the polls on November 8th, we need to get Hillary in office . We only meet in a public location and accept cash only no trades. All states, cities, and addresses available. Buy 2 get 1 free. Election special free IDs* ( you have no say as to information on these, they are already pre-populated and must be used to vote on Nov. 8th) § Screenshot captured before removal of Craigslist ad for Fake IDs. ※ Fake IDs Let＊s Get Hillary Elected 每 $1 (Detroit). ※ Lower portion of screenshot captured before removal of Craigslist ad for Fake IDs. ※ Fake IDs Let＊s Get Hillary Elected 每 $1 (Detroit). ※ Larger view of photo included in the Craigslist ad. selling forged driver＊s licenses. ※ Fake IDs Let＊s Get Hillary Elected 每 $1 (Detroit) .§ Notice how the same face is used to create several IDs from varying states. \nIt＊s extremely disturbing to hear over and over again about the lengths to which Democrats and Hillary and her minions (including the liberal media) will go in order to try to secure her election as president. Have they no shame, pride, or confidence at all? Maybe they all realize 〞 like the rest of us do 〞 that Hillary really is that awful of a person , in every possible way, and the only chance she has to get into the White House as president is to steal the election . They must know it. Otherwise, why would they try to hard to use fraud and corruption to get her there? \nIf true-blue, red-blooded Americans have anything to say about it 〞 and we most certainly do 〞 Hillary ＆Rotten＊ Clinton is not moving back in our house at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. We now know that during the years and even decades that we＊ve suspected mass corruption and fraud within the Democrat Party, we were right and we will never be fooled again.",

    "text": "Hillary Abruptly Stops At Rally, Couldn＊t Hide What Happened Seconds Later Posted on October 27, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This \nWhile speaking at her latest rally in Florida, Hillary Clinton＊s speech took an abrupt turn as she just stopped in the middle of a sentence. Unfortunately for her, what happened just seconds later was all caught on tape 每 and she couldn＊t hide it. \nDespite what she would have you believe, Hillary is not as healthy as she claims. As we＊ve seen strange eye movements that hint toward Parkinson＊s disease and an ever increasing difficulty to get up or down a flight of stairs , it＊s safe to say she won＊t make it 4 years in our White House. Hillary Clinton \nHowever, her most recent stunt has set a few people on edge as it goes to show that she＊s suffering from more than just physical impairments. According to The American Mirror , the female presidential hopeful suffered an embarrassing moment as her brain seemingly froze mid-sentence. \nAll caught on video, Hillary was speaking in Lake Worth, Florida on the topic of solar energy when the crowd started to cheer. At that moment, Hillary stopped dead in her tracks and tried to stutter through her thoughts. \n※They＊re not exactly known as the sunshine states,§ Clinton said. ※There＊s a lot of great things about those states, but think about the jobs that can be created, as well as contributing to what we need to do together to save＃§ she said before awkwardly pausing and finally adding, ※＃our country and the world.§ \nUnfortunately for her, not even she could hide the embarrassing brain freeze as it was all caught on camera. Although some people are saying she may have been distracted, that doesn＊t seem to be the case as it has happened before. \nIn fact, there is also footage of the last ordeal that took place before she gained the nomination. While speaking at a rally where she was attacking Bernie Sanders, a similarly embarrassing series of events played out: \nMany people have been saying how Hillary＊s brain isn＊t quite up to par, but we＊re seeing more and more of it as her campaign progresses. She has been in the campaign spotlight for about a year now, and America is starting to catch on to her dirty little secret. \nIf she can＊t handle one year on the campaign trail, how is she going to look in another few years after suffering the abuse that a presidential term comes with? Any responsible person would have dropped out long ago 每 like maybe, the first time she literally dropped in the streets at the 9/11 memorial event in New York City. \nIt just goes to show how far this woman is willing to go in her pursuit of power. Let＊s just hope that Donald Trump shuts her down in November before she can do our nation any more harm.",

The video captures one of her aides rushing towards her side as she attempted to climb up the riser. \n※She needed assistance to get onto it as she could be seen reaching her hand out for a boost or some added steadiness,§ according to The American Mirror . ※The aide extended his hand and Clinton held on tightly as she made her way up the 18 inches.§ \nAlthough Hillary Clinton insists that her health isn＊t an issue, the number of incidents she has had paints quite a different picture. If you take a close look at the video, the aide can even be seen standing behind her, reaching for her waist 每 probably preparing for the event of her falling. \nWe have said it time and time again 每 she＊s not fit to be president. Although her health is a major concern considering how demanding the presidency can be on a person, it＊s her disastrous political history that raises, even more, concerns.",

    "text": "Share This \nHillary Clinton＊s campaign is struggling after receiving blow after blow recently, even though the mainstream media would have us believe otherwise. As if the WikiLeaks dumps and Project Veritas videos weren＊t doing enough damage, private photos have begun circling the internet, and once you see them, it＊s easy to understand why they are destroying Hillary＊s presidential dreams. \nUnlike other leaks and sting operations, the private photos cropping up all across social media impact all voters in a way they can＊t deny. Contrary to what you may be thinking, the images aren＊t Hillary＊s private photographs, but rather, private snapshots her voters have taken that now have the   looking incredibly foolish. \nNews was recently released that Obamacare premiums will soar in the coming year, just as many conservatives predicted and warned. The 2017 increase is reported to be an average of 25% for the most popular plans, as the ※Affordable§ Care Act continues to rely on older, sicker customers than its architects and backers had anticipated, IJR explains. However, it＊s not just the Obamacare plans that are seeing a hike in premium costs. It seems to be happening to everyone, and many social media users took to Facebook to give a glimpse of the crippling damage being done to their finances. \nWith a quick search of the social media site, I was able to find more than a handful of photos that upset Americans have posted, showing their premium increases for 2017, and in many cases, it was much more than the already dreaded 25%. Have a look at the prices Americans will be paying next year: \nThis is what Hillary Clinton believes she can ※fix.§ My question is, how many families will be broke, bankrupt, or even homeless because of these crippling premiums before that ever happens if it ever happens? Maybe families who can＊t afford it could just skip having health insurance 〞 except that results in a financially devastating fine and, God forbid, should they need medical care, they are out of luck. \nEven Hillary＊s own husband, former President Bill Clinton, bashes Obamacare as a disaster while campaigning for his wife . While Bill was campaigning for Hillary in Goldsboro, North Carolina, on Tuesday, he listed all the problems with Obamacare. ※One of the problems with a law, we can all tick them off, right?§ Bill began. ※ The copays, deductibles, and premiums are too high, and the drug prices are too high. So, what does she say we should do? We should bargain for lower drug prices, the way that government can＊t now with Medicare and Medicaid for everybody.§ Bill Clinton says Obamacare has a \"list\" of problems: \"The copays, deductibles, and premiums are too high.\" https://t.co/jyvhYS4zXr \n〞 Republican Policy (@SenateRPC) October 26, 2016 \nUnlike Bill, Hillary has not only defended but praised Obamacare , refusing to admit that it needs to be repealed. She＊s even gone as far as to tout it as Hillycare . Obamacare 〞 or Hillarycare, if she prefers 〞 has been a disaster for millions of Americans as their premiums, deductibles, and copays all increase while less and less of their health care needs seem to be covered. \nBut, don＊t take my word for it. Before casting your vote on November 8 for someone calling Obamacare a ※success,§ I encourage you to check with your insurance company to see what your premiums, deductibles, and copays will be in 2017. Hillary has already warned us, ※I＊ve fought for quality, affordable healthcare my entire career. As president, I＊ll defend the Affordable Care Act , build on its successes, and go even further to reduce costs.§ The problems she＊s ignoring is that it＊s not affordable, it＊s far from a success, and it hasn＊t reduced costs. \nThat statement alone should be enough to have the majority of Americans unwilling to cast a vote in her direction, and if they find out their premiums for 2017 before November 8, that＊s going to ring even truer. So, the next time you hear a Hillary supporter excitedly ready to vote, tell them to make that one call. Find out what their insurance will look like under a Hillary presidency. As they say, money talks, bullshit walks. When her supporters find out how much Hillary will cost them, hopefully, they＊ll walk too.",

However, things didn＊t go so well for Hillary Clinton, who was humiliated when a camera caught what she immediately tried to hide to save her campaign 〞 which backfired big time. \nWhile Donald Trump＊s 15,000-person army of ※Deplorables§ were holding down the fort in Stanford, Florida as they listened to this great leader explain how he plans to make America great again, Hillary was at a much smaller venue at Palm Beach State College. Although she was feeling pretty good about herself with having a higher turnout than she＊s used to, the approximate 1,000 to 2,000 attendees paled in comparison to what Trump was looking at in the same state. However, Hillary＊s anemic crowd was enough to be publicly mocked in front of. \nPerhaps Hillary didn＊t think anyone would notice, but Fox Business Network was watching 〞 and commenting 〞 live. With just fifteen minutes before the Democratic candidate was set to take the stage in one of her final and most important rallies, the small room should have been jam-packed with people. As the humored hosts noted on the news show, that was far from the case. \n※Here it is nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford, Florida yesterday for Mr. Trump, 15,000. There＊s maybe a thousand to two thousand people here today,§ one host pointed out much to Hillary＊s embarrassment. ※The Clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see there＊s empty space here and she＊s supposed to speak in 15 minutes. And I can tell you that as the camera pans across that if we were at a Trump rally this would absolutely be packed,§ the commentators added. \nNo matter how far ahead in the polls Hillary and her lapdog media says she is, the attendance at her events speaks volumes. Nobody cares or is enthusiastic enough about this woman to bother showing up, and those who do have to be coached on how to chant and act excited. \nOn the other hand, there are Trump＊s rallies, where so many people turn up to venues four times the size as Hillary＊s that these massive stadiums can＊t contain everyone who is eager to come, and some are turned away. If the turnout at the rallies is any indicator of what＊s expected at the polls, Hillary can＊t win, and if she does, Americans should definitely question how that could even happen",

    "title": "Hillary＊s Healthcare ＆Fix＊ Exposed, Millions Of Americans Will End Up DEAD",
    "text": "Share This \nDon＊t be deceived by Hillary Clinton＊s lie that she＊ll fix Obamacare. She already tried to fix healthcare in 1994 when President Bill Clinton put her in charge of transforming our healthcare and insurance plans. She called it Hillarycare, and like Obamacare, it failed miserably. Now, her plans for Obamacare have been exposed 〞 along with how millions of Americans will end up dead thanks to her ※fix.§ \nHillary Clinton is a very dangerous woman. The one thing that scares healthcare professionals is her plans to fix Obamacare, which is falling apart with premiums going through the roof. It was always going to fail. \nAs a Registered Nurse for over 20 years, working in the inner city in Los Angeles, I saw firsthand how health care works. When Barack Obama and his Democratic minions passed Obamacare in 2010, I freaked out, knowing this would bring untimely deaths to many of my fellow Americans, and now that Hillary says she＊ll fix Obamacare, I can be silent no more. Hillary promises to fix Obamacare with full blown socialized medicine \nThe first thing you need to realize is that Obamacare was never the ultimate plan. It was meant to be a step toward total socialized medicine. Hillary will put Obamacare on steroids, and the goal is for a complete government controlled system that every American is enrolled in, where that is the only choice you have. \nThis is the same system that plagues Canada and Great Britain, and it means Americans will die. Instead of your doctor deciding what type of care you get, there are strict guidelines which all doctors must follow. If you are a woman diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you will only be given one path to take. You will not be allowed to find out about cutting edge drugs or treatments. You will be sent home to die. Kathleen Sebelius said, under Obamacare, ※someone lives and someone dies.§ \nUnder socialized medicine, it＊s all about cost effectiveness, and ovarian cancer has a high death rate. So, you＊re not worth the expensive treatment that may cure you or help you live longer. You won＊t even know those treatments exist. They＊ll pat you on the head, say how sorry they are, and tell you that they will do everything they can to keep you ※comfortable.§ \nThis won＊t affect the ultra-rich. This will affect the lower and middle class, who can＊t afford to seek treatment on their own. \nSocialized medicine will affect even happy events like having a baby. In keeping with the culture of death that surrounds socialized medicine, here＊s what happened to one mother in Great Britain whose baby was born at 22 weeks 〞 an age at which some infants have survived when life-saving measures were used. Tracy Goodwin watched in horror as they let her baby die. \nForty-six minutes later [after he was born], and despite her desperate pleas to midwives for assistance, Miss Godwin＊s son died as she held him. \nShe has since been told that the hospital has a policy not to resuscitate babies born earlier than 24 weeks into pregnancy. [via Daily Mail ] Tracy Goodwin (left) holds her baby boy, born at 22 weeks (right). \nIf you need to see a doctor, good luck. In Canada, they have to wait 3-4 months just to see their ※primary care physician.§ Canadians wait on average 35 weeks, or 6 months, to see a specialist after getting a referral, according to the Fraser Institue . If you have cancer, you could be dead by the time you can see an oncologist. \nThis is why most doctors and nurses are fleeing healthcare. We can no longer help our patients the right way, with clear consciences, and those doctors and nurses who support this kind of system are lying to themselves into believing that this system is healthcare. It＊s managed deathcare, and that is what Big Brother does best. \nWhat＊s the answer? Donald Trump . He will repeal Obamacare, and even if he does nothing else, it＊s a win. He is putting healthcare back into the free market where it belongs. What drives insurance prices down? Competition 〞 and that is what he will do when he opens up buying healthcare across state lines. \nLastly, a brain surgeon should be paid more than a truck driver, no offense to truck drivers. Yet, under socialized medicine, doctors are made to take a salary which is capped. This, in itself, does not give our smartest kids any incentive to become a brain surgeon. Making a lot of money drives those interested in medicine to become doctors. It＊s just a fact, and it made our healthcare system the best in the world before Obama came along. \nBack in 1994, Hillary tried to pass socialized medicine called Hillarycare, and it failed. Now, she is back, promising to fix Obamacare with Hillarycare, but if you value your loved ones＊ lives, there is only one thing to do. Make sure people realize what is at stake in this election. Literally, their lives are on the line if Donald Trump doesn＊t win.",

After exposing Hillary Clinton and leaving the reporter speechless, it＊s safe to say that it＊s over for the lying Democratic candidate. \nMiller went on Fox News on Wednesday to discuss what he was witness to in his state that Hillary definitely didn＊t want to get out.

Single-handedly, Trump brought back what Americans have been desperate for over the last eight years of lame duck leadership from Barack Obama. We want someone who proves that he loves his country, is ready to enact real change that everyone can see and not just be lied to about, a man who keeps his promises, loves the God that our country was built on, and will do whatever it takes to honor our rights and defeat our enemies.",

    "text": "Share This When 3 female Hillary supporters decided to steal dozens of Trump-Pence signs, they had no idea whose attention they caught. \nThree liberal women were so upset over Donald Trump＊s rising poll numbers that they decided to go around stealing the Republican candidate＊s campaign signs off of citizens＊ lawns. However, just as they were celebrating their bounty on the side of the road, they were instantly smacked with a perfect dose of American justice. \nLiberals are all for free speech unless you disagree with them. In that case, they＊ll instantly shut down the conversation by labeling you a racist bigot who hates women. If they＊re feeling especially unpatriotic, they＊ll let you know that your opinion is hate speech. This is exactly what a group of liberal feminists is claiming after they were recently caught depriving others of their freedom of expression. \nElizabeth ※Betta§ Stothart, Martha Murdick, and Heidi Kendrick were apparently so angry about Trump＊s ※locker room talk§ leaked just in time for the election that they decided to take matters into their own hands. The cowardly trio headed down Route 1 in Falmouth, Maine, plucking Trump-Pence signs from people＊s yards and tossing them into their vehicle. What the entitled misandrists didn＊t realize was that a heaping dose of karma was headed their way. \nFox News reports that the women pulled over on the side of the road on October 14, proudly admiring their unlawful deed, when suddenly a police officer approached the guilty party. Tipped off by their late-night suspicious behavior, the officer confiscated 36 stolen signs and made a report of the crime. \nHumiliated that their own ridiculous conduct was found out, the 3 thought that a warning would be the end of their embarrassment. Adding to their dismay, David Jones, the chairman of the Making Maine Great Again political action committee, heard about the sign thieves and immediately pressed charges of theft against all 3 women. Elizabeth ※Betta§ Stothart (pictured) and her accomplices, Martha Murdick and Heidi Kendrick, are scheduled to appear in court. \n※I have a lot of explaining and apologizing to do,§ Stothart wrote. ※I also have advice for anyone who might be on the verge of doing something stupid. It＊s not worth it. Find a healthy way to express your outrage.§ \nThe Hillary supporters are scheduled to appear in court on December 15, they still can＊t believe that stealing is breaking the law and, surprisingly to them, they are not above the law like their beloved candidate. \nThe women have been charged with theft and it＊s reported that the chairman isn＊t letting this go so easily. As cases of campaign sign theft are on the rise, these 3 are likely to be made the example to other potential political thieves. \nIn fact, Mad World News reported last week that a Democratic activist was arrested for stealing dozens of Trump-Pence signs in Northfield, Illinois. However, he was only charged with driving with a suspended license and was allowed to keep the stolen property. \nAs expected, one of the women made a pathetic attempt to excuse her juvenile behavior. In a Washington Post opinion piece, Stothart whines that she was ※angry§ about the women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment and abuse. Of course, she has no outrage over the women and children that Bill Clinton has sexually assaulted, not to mention the victims Hillary threatened and harassed to protect her sexual predator husband. \nFurther insulting actual victims of assault, Stothart likens her selective outrage over Trump signs to being ※assaulted,§ adding that it is ※rude§ for Trump supporters to place signs expressing their political stance on their private property but not equally as offensive for Democrats to show their support for heinous crimes like, say, butchering partially-birthed babies or voting for a woman who laughed about defending a child rapist who she knew was guilty. \nLeftist hacks like Stothart and her gang of mid-life crisis buddies give women a bad name, contributing to the stereotype that the female gender cannot control their emotions. Ending on a comical note, Stothart tells readers ※for God＊s sake, please, vote.§ That＊s right. A voter for the party that booed God＊s name 3 times at their national convention is telling everyone to vote 〞 unless, of course, you＊re voting for Trump. In that case, her tolerance extends as far as your front lawn.",

    "text": "Set Staff Horrified At What Hillary Is Caught Doing After Brutal Interview Posted on October 27, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Set of the Commander-in-Chief Forum (left), Hillary Clinton at the Forum (right) \nIt was only a matter of time before the glue that keeps Hillary Clinton together cracked and her true evil self came out from behind her forced smile. Looking visibly uncomfortable in front of the camera during a particularly brutal interview, Hillary exited stage left as quick as she could when a horrified staff member caught what she did backstage. \nHillary probably felt safe going into the interview by liberal-leaning Matt Lauer, who conducted a televised question and answer session with the Democratic candidate in September at the Commander-in-Chief Forum. As she＊s apparently accustomed to, Hillary allegedly received a list of questions before the event, so she could prepare her answers (lies) and prevent being caught on the spot to come up with what to say, making her come across flawlessly to the public. Thinking everything was worked to her advantage as is typically the case, Lauer threw the candidate a curve ball that Hillary couldn＊t hide from. \nAccording to The Watch Towers, a Comcast official (the parent company of NBC Universal) stated that Lauer went rogue when he asked ※one legitimate question about the FBI investigation concerning her homemade server and the unsecured emails.§ The alleged informant said at that point ※we could see she (Hillary) was beginning to boil.§ \nIt＊s evident by her expression and tone caught in the recording of the Forum interview that Hillary wasn＊t happy about being forced to answer a question she wasn＊t prepared for. Holding her rage inside the best she could, the person claiming to be a producer on the set, accused Hillary of launching an explosive verbal assault on her staff backstage after the interview. \n※She was in a full meltdown and no one on her staff dared speak with her 每 she went kind of manic and didn＊t have any control over herself at that point,§ the anonymous informant claimed in an unconfirmed report by Watch Towers . \n※Hillary proceeded to pick up a full glass of water and throw it at the face of her assistant, and the screaming started,§ the description of the alleged events also said. The staffer claimed that they heard Hillary turn her rage on Donald Trump, saying, ※If that f 每 每 每 ing bastard wins, we all hang from nooses! Lauer＊s finished＃and if I lose it＊s all on your heads for screwing this up.§ \nWhile the reports of this incident have not been authenticated, it definitely doesn＊t seem out of character for Hillary, and with what happened to Lauer after the interview certainly shows that the Democratic candidate complained. ※Matt Lauer was massively criticized for the rest of the week on air by the Clinton campaign and the rest of the MSM as having conducted ＆an unfair and partisan attack on Clinton＊,§ Watch Towers reported. \nAs we saw in the court hearings over Benghazi, Hillary is a loose cannon when being called out on her illegal, dishonest, and deadly actions that she＊s not used to being confronted on. Whether this explosive tirade happened or not 〞 to any degree of severity 〞 her angry actions against the American people and our heroes she disrespects, speak volumes about who she is, which isn＊t someone we need leading our country.",

    "text": "Share This \nDonald Trump＊s Diversity Chairwoman Brunell Donald-Kyei has been laying waste to anyone who takes her on, and she just shredded one of Michelle Obama＊s favorite spokesmen, Brian Benjamin, who now works on Hillary Clinton＊s campaign. When it came to the race card, Brunell was lethal, cutting down his every liberal lie. She tore him apart, then kicked him to the curb, as another Michelle and Hillary spokesman bit the dust. Michelle Obama＊s favorite pundit Brian Benjamin (left), Hillary & her hot sauce (middle), Brunell Donald-Kyei (right) \nBrian Benjamin kept an arrogant smile on his face as Donald Trump＊s Diversity Chairwoman Brunell Donald-Kyei surgically sliced through Hillary＊s pandering to the black community. They appeared on Fox and Friends a few days ago and the video is only getting more popular as interest in Brunell＊s tactics is making headlines. \nUnsurprisingly, Fox & Friends Monday has been focusing on the latest to emerge out of the WikiLeaks scandal, and one detail concerning the use of the phrase ※ yo mama ,§ suggested a pandering effort to an African American crowd by Clinton earlier this year. Joining Fox & Friends to discuss was vice-chair of the Trump National Diversity Coalition Brunell Donald-Kyei who said, ※The pandering is not working. Black people just want a real seat at the table.§ [via Mediaite ] \nAs Brunell laid Benjamin out cold, he had to pull out the race card, but that was a wrong move. Brunell was waiting for it, and she launched into a tirade that made Hillary and her ※hot sauce§ in my purse comment look as stupid as it sounded, as poor Steve Doocy tried to moderate. \nBrunell went off, saying the communities need jobs, not hot sauce and ※yo mama§ jokes. She added that the black community wants empowerment and the Democratic party to keep its promises. Benjamin was quick to interrupt, alleging Trump talks about law and order but ignores systemic issues between the community and the police. However, Brunell wasn＊t about to let him get away with his lie. \nShe quickly pointed out that mass incarceration happened under Bill and Hillary Clinton, telling Benjamin that he knows that too. ※His wife [Hillary] was ok with that. So don＊t go there,§ she said. ※Let Donald Trump fix it. Let a person who is a builder and a doer fix it.§ \nBenjamin tried to retort, calling Trump a racist, and that＊s all it took to really cause Brunell to unleash. ※ Not a loser, not a taco bowl, or needy Latino? Really? Are we going there? Catholics are bastardized. Are we going there? ※ she asked, referring to the WikiLeaks emails that exposed the Hillary camp＊s true thoughts and nasty remarks about many Americans. \nBenjamin shot back, ※Yea, let＊s go there,§ before Brunell finished him off, saying, ※I went there, WikiLeaks is out in the streets, Sir. I read WikiLeaks. I read about the corruption.§ \nThis exchange proves that when these Hillary shills get beat, they turn to the race card every time. When Brunell hears that, as a black woman, she can go full throttle at Benjamin, and his nervous laughter and scoffing means he is embarrassed and lost this argument, which shreds Hillary＊s whole narrative about why Americans shouldn＊t vote for Trump. \nHillary is a one note wonder. She has no positive record to run on, and her whole campaign is based on bullying Trump supporters. In her narrative, Trump is a Nazi and so are those of us who support him. So, we are fair game to be bullied 〞 on the internet or in person as we have seen the paid thugs do. \nIt＊s all smoke and mirrors because it just doesn＊t hold true, and Brunell brought that out as she left Benjamin, one of Hillary＊s token black spokesmen, to languish as he failed to make anyone believe the lie Hillary is trying to sell to Americans. This is all Hillary＊s got to run on, and it will not be enough to win.",

    "text": "As Hillary Stumbles Up Plane Steps, Cameras Catch What She Tried To Hide   Robert Rich   \nHillary Clinton has been a busy woman, trying to keep up her appearances and make Americans believe she is in prime condition and fit for the presidency. However, she recently stumbled as she going up some steps. Too bad for her, cameras were there to catch what she tried to hide the entire way up. \nHillary was set to fly to a rally in Winston-Salem, North Carolina on her private jet, but not before making a fool of herself on the steps. Those on the right have been saying for months now that there＊s something not right regarding Hillary＊s health 每 and a recent video may just prove that. \nAlthough the clip starts out simple enough, Hillary only makes it about halfway up the stairs before she stumbles a bit. From there on out, the female presidential hopeful tried to hide her seemingly unsteady trek up the rest of the stairs. \nViewers watch as Hillary slows her pace and grips even tighter on that railing on her way up. She can also be seen looking down to ensure that every step lands with a firm foot as she makes her climb 每 something that people without a fear of frequent falls wouldn＊t do. \nPerhaps what＊s even stranger is the fact that just after she started stumbling, it appears as though Hillary is muttering something to herself for much of the short journey to the plane. Although it＊s just speculation, it looks as though Hillary was flustered by the trip. However, people seem most concerned with her labored ascent up those steps. \nIn fact, The Daily Mirror adds: \nFrom the time she departed her motorcade van, which was positioned right at the bottom of the stairs, all the way to the top of the steps, she appeared to be wobbly and unsteady, and laboring during the trek. \nMaybe it was because she had the extra 〞 arduous 〞 task of carrying an umbrella? \nIt doesn＊t take much to see just how weak and frail Hillary Clinton is, and videos like this only make it that much clearer. This woman doesn＊t so much resemble a presidential candidate as she does someone＊s ailing grandma. It＊s time for Hillary to face the music and throw in the towel. If she can＊t physically handle a one-year campaign, she＊s certainly not suited for what a 4-year presidential term is going to throw at her.",

    "text": "Trump Supporters Get Last Laugh After Hillary Disrespects Them On Radio Show Posted on October 27, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics Share This \nHillary Clinton is once again pandering to the black community as she＊s often done, changing who she is depending on who she is talking to. However, just yesterday, she made a wrong move, hitting Donald Trump＊s supporters as she told a hip-hop radio show that Trump and his supporters need to do one thing. Unfortunately for her, she quickly learned that she can＊t talk trash and get away with it anymore. \nHillary showed up on some hip-hop radio station in New York yesterday, and the interview was pure propaganda as she tried to pander to the black community. Hillary even agreed that she gets her fashion look from Death Row Records＊ Suge Knight and Snoop Dogg. \nWherever she gets it, that look is hideous and horrible. Not to mention, Death Row Records was made famous by a song titled ※F*ck The Police.§ That seems rather fitting since Hillary doesn＊t care about cops. She just needs black voters to show up on election day. Hillary agreed with a black radio host that she gets her look from Death Row records, a known cop-hating label that produced the song ※F*ck The Police.§ \nAfter talking about her failed fashion sense, she had to get her jab in on Donald Trump, but she took it further than she should have. The Breakfast Club radio host told Hillary that the whole country is divided and that she has to bring it back together. This sparked Hillary to launch her attack, saying: \n※ What Trump has done is to make it possible for people who have racist and sexist and all kinds of prejudices and bigotry to put them right out there ,§ Hillary said. ※But what he＊s done really [is] unleashed a lot of darkness and divisiveness.§ \nWe all know the only game Hillary＊s got going is this thinly veiled narrative that Trump supporters are racist, sexist, and violent. We are ※deplorables,§ a remark she purposefully made to describe Trump supporters because it is her campaign plan. \nUnfortunately for her, Trump supporters aren＊t stupid, and those who are very active on social media fought back at her false rhetoric. For hours after her comments on that radio show, the hashtag # HillarysBullies was trending worldwide. \nTrump supporters made a mockery out of Hillary , sending a truth bomb straight at her. It＊s Hillary who is purposely dividing the country with her rhetoric. It＊s Hillary who hired paid thugs to beat up Trump supporters. Even Mike Pence got into the act, and below is his tweet to Hillary: \"I'm Hillary Clinton & I approve this message.\" #HillarysBullies were bought & paid for. pic.twitter.com/onahYVpGlw \n〞 Deplorable VP (@MikePenceVP) October 27, 2016 \nHillary is losing this election. Every indication outside the mainstream press shows that there＊s little to no enthusiasm for her campaign. Record-breaking numbers of Trump supporters have been seen across the country where early voting is allowed, and even today, Hillary needed Michelle Obama to beg North Carolinians to bring out people to vote. \nWith only days left, Trump supporters slapped Hillary hard on social media, and all she＊s got is a weak campaign slogan and the lie that Trump＊s a racist and so are his deplorable supporters. From her small rally sizes, it＊s clear, Americans smell her bullcrap and no one really wants to hear that screeching voice or see her win.",

    "text": "SHOCKING: Hillary＊s Looking At Disaster & Anthony Weiner＊s To Blame Posted on October 28, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics Share This \nHillary Clinton just got hit with a huge roadblock by the FBI in her quest for the presidency, and things are looking pretty dire for her campaign and election hopes. However, the Clintons play dirty, and she won＊t go down easily. Yet, in a crazy turn of events, it looks like the fall of Hillary Clinton is linked to none other than Anthony Weiner, and what＊s been exposed now going to shock the whole world. Hillary Clinton (left), Anthony Weiner (right) \nHillary＊s campaign was rocked today by FBI James Comey as he announced the reopening of the investigation into Hillary＊s email server and sending of classified emails. When Hillary spoke in Iowa after the huge announcement, she was delusional as she gave her prepared comments and said nothing about the FBI＊s case against her. \nAdding fuel to the fire, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook did something pretty damning, just minutes after the Comey announcement. He deleted his entire Twitter feed and years of tweets that must have incriminated him in some way to Hillary＊s email scandal. But, that＊s not all. \nFox News is reporting that the FBI found other emails from another government official, not from WikiLeaks but coming from an investigation into Anthony Weiner , which may indicate that his wife Huma Abedin, Hillary＊s closest aide, is the link to the disaster Hillary is now facing: \n※A senior law enforcement official separately told Fox News the FBI decision is not linked to WikiLeaks messages or any hack, and the newly discovered emails did not come from the Clinton server 每 but from another device from another government official.§ \nHillary doesn＊t live in the real world very well, so she won＊t go quietly, even though it＊s pretty clear her campaign is probably over. Even when facing defeat against Barack Obama in 2008, she would not give up. \nEven when it came to the battle for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton refused to concede defeat until the bitter end and then past it. Not only did Hillary refuse to drop out even when Obama was the clear winner, while her people threatened a convention floor fight, but she insisted on staying on in the race for increasingly bizarre and even downright disturbing reasons. \nIn South Dakota, Hillary explained that there was no reason for her to drop out because somebody might shoot Barack Obama, ※We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.§ [via Sultan Knish ] \nEven after Obama had clinched the delegate votes, Hillary＊s speech brought back the Al Gore argument that George Bush didn＊t win the election in 2000, saying, ※Nearly 18 million of you cast your votes for our campaign, carrying the popular vote with more votes than any primary candidate in history. Even when the pundits and the naysayers proclaimed week after week that this race was over, you kept on voting.§ Robby Mook (left) deleted his entire Twitter feed after FBI re-opened email case, Huma Abedin & Hillary Clinton (right) \nLook for Hillary, refusing to drop out of this campaign, and We the People need to put pressure on the FBI to conclude this investigation before Election Day. We cannot have a sitting president who will be going to prison, and yet, we know that Hillary Clinton will refuse to drop out no matter how dire this situation truly is. \nThe mere fact that we all know she is guilty of sending classified documents makes her unfit to hold any political office ever again, and Americans must demand Hillary Clinton is held accountable. It＊s time we take back our country and put Hillary in prison where she belongs.",

The partiality and voter fraud are so severe that many were left wondering if there＊s really any way to beat Hillary or if it＊s a predetermined selection from the liberal elitists. \nJust as Hillary thought she was going to hobble straight into the White House again, however, she received some news that crucially threatens her election during the most critical time. \nBreitbart reports that less than one week after Trump was suffering an immense lag behind Hillary in the polls, the gap is suddenly coming to a close with the Republican nominee leaping forward a massive 5 points, leaving him just 4 behind the Democratic opponent. Even though Trump was at 38 percent on October 22, he has since rapidly climbed to 44 percent and is expected to seal the gap. \nThe unbelievable rise in Trump＊s support comes just before the FBI announced that it is reopening their investigation into Hillary＊s private email server, meaning that his approval rating is sure to skyrocket even further with the great chance that he＊ll surpass the scandalous liberal candidate just as voters head to the polls. Even before the FBI announced it will re-investigate Hillary Clinton＊s private email server, Trump was already closing the polling gap. It＊s likely that he will easily catch up to her since more classified emails have been leaked. \nWhat＊s even more miraculous is that Trump is fighting against all odds, including a stifling media bias that＊s found to wholly working against him with 91 percent of 184 opinionated statements considered to be negative. However, even this buying of the mainstream media hasn＊t stopped the hypothetical Trump train, as the underdog candidate even won early votes in Florida and is the only Republican to do so in the critical swing state. \nAlthough Hillary and her media pets have been tirelessly scheming around the clock to discourage citizens from voting for Trump, reporting fake poll numbers that show her in a major lead, even the left-leaning ABC and Washington Post couldn＊t deny Trump＊s rapid incline. Not only has Trump gained 5 points, according to their tracking poll, Hillary fell 2, meaning that either undecided or Hillary voters are beginning to support Trump. \nIronically, even Hillary＊s campaign manager Robby Mook was forced to admit that Trump could very well be the next U.S. President. \n※Donald Trump has been going around telling people not to listen to the polls, and saying that he can still win this race. Well, you know what, he＊s absolutely right,§ Mook announced in a video. \nJust minutes after FBI Director James Comey officially announced the reopened investigation, the stocks suddenly started to tank , which many believe is indicative of a Trump win. It appears as though the liberal elite and Wall Street bankers are panicking at the idea that the easily bought Hillary might not make it to November 8. \nRegardless of your stance on the presidential election, it＊s clear that the mainstream media has been purchased and is striving to scare Trump voters away from the polls. Considering that this is true, imagine just how many more potential Trump voters are staying home because they feel as though a victory is hopeless 〞 when, indeed, it＊s obviously not.",

    "text": "Clinton Advisor LOSES IT In Leaked Email Over Hillary＊s Illegal Activity Posted on October 28, 2016 by Dawn Parabellum in Politics Share This \nNothing is more satisfying than Democrats turning on each other, and that＊s exactly what has happened in the Hillary Clinton camp. As if we haven＊t heard enough of Hillary＊s incompetence and corruption, a newly leaked email shows a top Clinton advisor absolutely losing it over Hillary＊s illegal activity, and her shocking admissions don＊t paint a pretty picture for the Democrat Party. \nThieves and liars are commonplace, but when a person is running for President of the United States, perhaps they should conduct themselves in a manner that commands respect. Hillary Clinton has never been trustworthy in the eyes of rational Americans, and even her advisors picked up on the trouble she＊s gotten herself in. The leaked emails are telling and have shown the Clinton campaign as struggling with damn near every aspect of her run for president because Americans are fed up with her lies and corruption. Hillary Clinton \nIn newly-released emails from WikiLeaks, Neera Tanden, co-chair of Clinton＊s transition team, cusses at John Podesta, Clinton＊s campaign chairman. Tanden is upset about Hillary using the private email and server system, wondering who could have approved of such a thing, which literally left Hillary＊s team hoping that the Democratic Party isn＊t ※suicidal.§ Obviously, Tanden is angry because the scandal is damning to Hillary＊s political career, and they are all linked to the corrupt Democrat. Email from Tanden to Podesta complaining about Hillary＊s email debacle \nTanden actually said that whoever gave the OK should be ※drawn and quartered,§ calling the whole situation ※f***ing insane§ in the July 2015 message. Podesta even agreed with her assessment and that the refusal to mention it earlier was ※unbelievable.§ Hillary Clinton advisor, Neera Tanden \n※[I] guess I know the answer,§ Tanden replied. ※[T]hey wanted to get away with it.§ \nHillary Clinton has still declined to answer to any of the revelations leaked in the Podesta emails. It＊s likely that there is absolutely no good way for her to handle any of this. She could claim her advisors are liars, but then we would question her judgment in selecting them. She could admit that everything is true, but that＊s just coming out stating emphatically that she＊s a corrupt criminal. Or, she could just ignore it and hope her lapdog media will make it go away, which seems to be exactly what she＊s doing. \nThe leaked Podesta emails are not done, and with the election coming upon us quickly, it＊s hard to image what else will be released. Those of us who actually do care about the abuses of government, unlike the mainstream media, will keep a diligent eye and report what＊s found because we all know that the media is trying to sweep this under the rug permanently. Too bad for them, it＊s not going to work, and thanks to the internet and social media, not only can we inform ourselves, we can spread the information to others without relying on the equally corrupt press who are covering for that crooked Clinton.",

    "title": "BAD News For Obama As FBI Exposes Damning Thing He Quietly Did To Hillary",
    "text": "Share This \nThis election is arguably the most important our nation has ever faced, and things seem to be reaching a boiling point for America. Proving just that is the bad news Barack Obama just got after the FBI exposed the damning thing he quietly did to Hillary Clinton 每 and it means trouble for everyone involved. \nAs many Americans were made aware on Friday, the FBI has reopened the investigation into Hillary＊s email scandal. However, a few theories circling the web indicate that the recent turn of events points to something much darker. \nIn fact, as Internet sleuths have more time to dig around the deepest corners of the web, it seems as though FBI Director James Comey＊s hand may have actually been forced when it comes to the investigation. Seeing how both Wikileaks and famed hacker Kim Dotcom have Hillary＊s 33,000 emails and are intent on releasing them in the upcoming week, the FBI was forced to make a move 每 but things only get more interesting the further down the rabbit hole we go. \nAt this point, the media is taking Wikileaks very seriously, and considering who could be implicated in the leak, something had to be done. In short, the theory suggests that several high-ranking officials up to and including Barack Obama are actually involved in Hillary＊s little scandal. (Photo Source: Red State Watcher ) \nAlthough she thinks otherwise, Hillary is actually a very small fish in the big pond of established politicians, and she＊s about to find that out the hard way. In fact, it seems that Obama may actually be responsible for the FBI pressing forward on the investigation. \nWith the theory picked up by Rush Limbaugh , a recent caller expounded on the belief a bit more, saying that Obama was facing a time crunch. In essence, knowing he would be implicated if the full email leak was made public, it would show his complicity in Hillary＊s illegal behavior, meaning that he has a pretty serious bullet to dodge. I know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally @TGowdySC @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump . 100% true. Retweet. pic.twitter.com/eir8r0FJ8M \n〞 Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 26, 2016 \nFurthermore, seeing how Kim Dotcom told everyone how officials could legally get their hands on Hillary＊s emails, this made the reality even more pressing. As more came out, Obama realized the only thing he could do to save his own skin would be to have Comey come forward and say that they ※miraculously§ found new emails pertinent to the investigation. \nIn order to do this, Obama and the other Democrats involved must have made a joint decision to throw Hillary under the bus. When all is said and done, America will be so focused 每 with many extremely pleased 每 that no one will even think twice about what＊s in the rest of those emails. (Photo Source: Red State Watcher ) \nAlthough this sounds like a win, many Americans want to turn it into a win-win and take down two birds (or maybe more) with one stone. Those emails are going to come out either way. Although Obama would like to divert your attention elsewhere, justice should come to all of those who break the law. Frightened Failed Obama gets Heckled & Dodges Reporters as They Scream Questions of James Comey Huma Abedin Hillary Clinton #HillarysEmails pic.twitter.com/bNw5XdDEjb \n〞 DEPLORABLE TRUMPCAT (@Darren32895836) October 28, 2016 \nWe＊ve been told lies too many times from both Obama and Hillary, and it seems that the web they weaved is becoming rather tangled at this point. We all know that there is no loyalty in politics unless it directly benefits the person giving it. \nBarack Obama was endorsing Hillary Clinton, but it only stands to reason that the moment he was threatened, he＊d throw her under the bus in the name of self-preservation. The jig is up and the Democratic party is going down. Let＊s just hope the FBI decides to sink those final nails in Hillary＊s coffin before the election and announce official charges against her. We the people are fed up, and just as Hillary once said, ※No one is too big to jail.§ Those words are coming back to bite her in the end.",

In a? stunning turn of events, new? evidence is revealing that Democrats are now turning on Hillary by the droves. \nImmediately after the news hit of the FBI＊s new investigation, Hillary held a press conference where she urged Americans to ※get out and vote early,§ apparently realizing her supporters would change their minds once whatever＊s in those emails leaks to the public.

These same ※early voters§ she was targeting in her speech have now begun to jump ship, as a devastating new poll reveals. \nVoting is indeed underway.

The Independent Journal revealed.? \nStates allowing voters to change their early votes include many key battleground? states such as Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.

In her short and quick statement, she carefully explained that the American people have nothing to worry about. However, without even realizing it, she incriminated herself by admitting her guilt with just ten revealing words that most people missed. \nJust when Hillary Clinton thought she was in the clear and free from any further questions regarding her criminal behavior, the FBI found more evidence and reopened their investigation on her secret e-mail server. Instead of preparing for the upcoming election and sealing in as many last votes as she can, Hillary＊s been forced to redirect some of her attention on covering up her own lies. \nDuring her press conference to address the public, she desperately tried to convince us all that there＊s nothing to be worried about. An unidentified reporter asked, ※What would you say to a voter who right now will be seeing you and hearing what you＊re saying, saying I didn＊t trust her before. I don＊t trust her anymore right now.

She doesn＊t want the FBI to release more information and sway her supporters to vote elsewhere, ruining her chance to be president. She＊s guilty and desperate for votes. The only way she can secure those voters is if she convinces her mindless sheep to vote early before all of her dirty deeds become known. \nIf I were Donald Trump, I＊d be doing a happy dance.

By incorporating the ※Hillary§ sign into a sentence, the people in the building next door made the liberal regret hanging their stupid sign. \nUnlike the sea of Donald Trump signs that fill neighborhoods throughout the country, it＊s exceptionally rare to see a sign supporting Hillary Clinton for president. Perhaps this person of the top floor of a small apartment building was making up for that by being loud and proud of their criminal candidate, but the people parallel to them won the war of words in a big way. \nJohn Nolte posted a photo of the opinionated neighbors, noting that he＊s not sure where these buildings are, but the message they made was very clear. Rather than ripping the Hillary sign down, setting it on fire, or any other destructive act of vandalism that liberals have done to Trump signs, the clever conservative simply completed what the liberal should have said, adding ※Is A Liar§ to their windows so passersby read the overall display as ※Hillary Is A Liar.§ Photo of the war or words between neighbors, Tweeted by John Nolte \nThis statement is not only true but also proves the difference in each candidate＊s followers when they disagree with something.

    "text": "Hillary HQ Gets Massive Surprise Outside Right After FBI Announcement Posted on October 30, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Hillary Clinton \nHours after the FBI announced that they are reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s e-mails, the liberals holed up at the Democratic headquarters in Ohio opened their door to a massive surprise outside that they weren＊t expecting. Now, they＊re getting the police involved as they fear this is the start to much more unwanted attention from Donald Trump supporters. \nWhile Trump headquarters in various states have become targets of violence from angry Hillary supporters who don＊t know how to handle themselves, when the tables are turned, the response is much different. ※What reasonable person thinks this is OK????§ party chair Bethe Goldenfield complained in a post in the Greater Cincinnati Politics facebook group with the hashtag #TrumpLovesHate. ※I won＊t be responding to anyone who thinks this is acceptable behavior. It is ILLEGAL!§ she said of what she＊s taking as a terror attack on their party, but apparently didn＊t seem to think the same when Trump＊s party office was firebombed a few states away. \nSending a very fitting message about what people think not only of Hillary but of the Democratic Party, an unknown individual unloaded a massive mound of manure in the parking lot. Obviously, this person was just giving back a small portion of what Dems have been feeding Americans for years and is symbolic of what comes out of Hillary＊s mouth, which is why the FBI is now re-investigating her. However, Goldenfield doesn＊t see the humor in it since it wasn＊t a molotov cocktail at a Republican office. Manure pile left outside the Democratic Headquarters in Lebanon, Ohio \nAccording to Cincinnati.com , Goldenfield was alerted to the manure pile by the police in Lebanon who called her at about 7:45 on Saturday morning, which she took full advantage of by urging a widespread investigation to nab the person responsible. ※Hopefully the perps will be held accountable for their actions,§ she said, repeating her inaccurate #TrumpLovesHate hashtag. \nThe local GOP office came under some speculation of involvement, but not only did they announce that they had nothing to do with this, they offered to help clean it up 〞 something that Democrats didn＊t offer in Indiana and North Carolina when both offices suffered actual destructive damage, unlike this case of a nonviolent attack that didn＊t damage property.",

    "text": "30 Mins After FBI News, Hillary Exited Plane＃ Did One Dirty Thing Before Posted on October 30, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This \nWe know that the FBI reopening its investigation of Hillary Clinton＊s emails couldn＊t have been good news for the presidential hopeful, but the fact that it took her a whopping 30 minutes to exit her plane after landing speaks volumes on the matter. However, it seems that Hillary made sure to do one dirty thing before walking down those stairs. \nCrooked Hillary is a cowardly schemer 每 and her recent actions go to prove just that. Mad World News reported Friday that after the news broke of FBI Director James Comey reopening their investigation, Hillary was seen rapidly exiting her plane and ignoring reporters before darting into her SUV. Just In: Clinton declines to answer questions about the FBI as she deplanes in Cedar Rapids. Sat on tarmac for 30 minutes after news broke. pic.twitter.com/zC115U7YNp \n〞 Adam D. Brown (@aduanebrown) October 28, 2016 \nHowever, recent reports indicate that her dodging the matter at hand began far before that point . In fact, Hillary＊s staff made sure to disable the plane＊s Wi-Fi after the news broke so that the reporters onboard wouldn＊t learn of the matter until they got on the ground. Of note as we wait for Clinton: plane had no wi-fi today. One adviser after we landed: \"We're learning about this just like you all are.\" pic.twitter.com/CjsH71LJNo \n〞 Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) October 28, 2016 \nOf course, Hillary made sure to stay far away from the media seats until she got off the plane, but it didn＊t end there. As reporters had questions about Hillary, an adviser used President Barack Obama＊s time-old line saying 〞 ※We＊re learning about this just like you all are.§ Clinton＊s plane did not have WiFi. Her advisors learned about the FBI letter when you did. https://t.co/C0uSXheh1i https://t.co/BAGhckS2aN \n〞 CNN (@CNN) October 28, 2016 \nAlthough CNN tried their best to make it sound as if they didn＊t have Internet access on the plane at all, the Wall Street Journal＊s Byron Tau came forward saying that Hillary＊s plane is equipped with Wi-Fi. Hillary has been dodging the consequences of her actions since the beginning of her campaign, but this is a new low for even her. The Hillary plane has wifi. https://t.co/dLZ0tigZhP \n〞 Byron Tau (@ByronTau) October 28, 2016 \nAt this point, she knowingly put those in charge of getting information to the world in the dark in order to protect herself. Too bad for her, running only gets you so far in terms of justice. She will one day have to face the music. \nAs the saying goes 每 ※you can run, but you can＊t hide,§ and the noose that all those guilty of treason get in the end seems to be getting closer and closer every day.",

    "text": "Trump＊s Camp Manager DESTROYS Hillary By Pointing Out 1 Thing We All Missed Posted on October 30, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Fox News Host (left), Trump＊s Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway (right) \nFrom the moment the FBI announced they＊re investigating Hillary Clinton again, her ship of supporters quickly became lighter with people bailing out to protect themselves from being associated with her as a criminal. Donald Trump＊s campaign couldn＊t have asked for better vindication that the witch could soon be incarcerated, but the Republican candidate＊s campaign manager just put the final nail in Clinton＊s coffin. \nIn the wake of this latest development that could save Western civilization, Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News to discuss it, but she delivered more than viewers were expecting. In a statement that didn＊t just decimate Hillary＊s campaign, she brought the entire Clinton family down with it in one perfectly stated sentence. \nWhen the FBI cracks a case back open that they had previously closed, there＊s a legitimate reason to be terrified for the outcome of that investigation, and it＊s almost guaranteed to end in incarceration. Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom validated this when he said after the announcement that the final bomb is about to drop on Hillary within the next ten days. Adding to everything coming back to haunt Hillary since Friday, is what Conway said on Fox News: \n※What we are reminded of is this cloud of corruption that always follows Hillary Clinton and we are having this entire conversation about a renewed FBU investigation because Hillary Clinton did what she always does, put Hillary first＃we can never get the stench and the stain of the Clintons off if us it turns out.§ \nCall it karma or the combined forces of WikiLeaks, James O＊Keefe, and now the FBI, who are all working together to bleach this ※stain§ from the White House, but things just aren＊t looking good for Hillary who had it coming. Hopefully, the FBI who failed the American people after the first investigation that ended with her still being able to run for president, make good on that mistake by actually arresting her after round two. \nThe investigation now is entirely different than the first, considering the fact that it was reopened. For that reason alone, Hillary shouldn＊t feel comfortable about the outcome.",

Crazy happenings have just transpired in the last 24 hours, and you＊ll love Hillary＊s scandalous stop that＊s making it so much worse as Rachel Maddow gets caught having a breakdown on live TV. \nHillary embarrassed herself last night at a free concert given in her name by Jennifer Lopez and her ex-husband Marc Anthony. Hillary came out on stage and pandered so badly to the Latino community that it came off as repulsive. Rachel Maddow cries on live TV over Hillary Clinton＊s campaign imploding over new email scandal with Anthony Weiner. \nAfter Rachel Maddow learned that Hillary sustained what she called ※a brick being thrown right at the Clinton campaign,§ referring to James Comey＊s actions, she was caught fighting back tears as another liberal hack tried to convince her that the FBI＊s decision to re-open the email scandal is a big deal. \nMaddow was hoping he would tell her not to worry and that Hillary can still win, but when she didn＊t get that news she wanted, she became enraged and then fought back tears. However, it all got worse with what Hillary did this morning. \nThis morning, Hillary Clinton was caught making a stop at a Miami bar before noon. That＊s right, calling it a campaign stop, Hillary strolled into the bar, which looked like a sleazy kind of place, and created even more controversy for the candidate since her drinking has been a sore subject since day one of this campaign. False alarm on missing hillary.

However, since everyone was scared of her, no one wanted to do it.§ \n※Should I call her and talk this through or better to leave with you? I＊m worried she＊ll get on with Cheryl and we＊ll end up in a bad place. I＊m in a session that lasts till 3:30 your time. Is that timely or should I walk out?§ ＃ \n※I just sent. Was getting my hair cut and trying to write all this on an iPhone. I think you should call her and sober her up some .§ [via Wikileaks ] \nHillary＊s drinking problems are well known by Washington insiders, so after the last 24 hours, seeing the fallout as her campaign was squashed, making a stop at a Miami bar before noon makes perfect sense. \nHillary＊s going to need a lot more than Jennifer Lopez gyrating while wearing a thong on stage and Rachel Maddow crying on live TV to breathe life into her dead campaign. We better be on high alert for some manufactured scandal coming at Donald Trump. Too bad for Hillary, it will be seen for what it is 〞 Hillary and her henchmen trying to save her unsalvageable campaign.",

As she carries on with her sparsely-planned campaign stops in the final days of the election, Iowans were shocked to see what she brought with her to her speech right after the investigation was announced. \nNo matter how hard Hillary tries, everything she hides seems to have a way of coming out. Karma is certainly working in favor of the American citizens who deserve to know the truth about this woman trying to bully her way into the White House. \nWhen she was in Iowa this weekend, just hours after the FBI announced they are re-opening the investigation into her e-mails thanks to her right-hand woman＊s dirty husband, Hillary brought a familiar ※friend§ that the public couldn＊t ignore, which is why photos of it have now gone viral. During the second presidential debate, we were first introduced to Hillary＊s ironic nemesis, which wasn＊t just her opponent Donald Trump. \nA fly pestered the Democratic candidate on live TV as she spoke, sticking to her and never touching Trump in what seemed symbolic since she stinks of lies and everyone knows flies are attracted to garbage. As embarrassing? as this may have been for Hillary, she can＊t pass it off as a random event since it happened again in a completely different state. That＊s right a?? while she was in Iowa, a fly once again? wouldn＊t leave her face. Can't even make this up. How many times has a FLY landed on Crooked Rotten Hillary now?!

It＊s not coincidental that this has now happened twice to this candidate in less than a month, and perhaps the fly is just a sign of what the FBI investigation is about to uncover. \nLike a crow symbolizing death, the black fly during this election represents the end of Hillary＊s campaign since it seems to sense everything she＊s trying to hide.",

    "text": "BOMBSHELL: Hillary Clinton＊s Leaked Audio Proves She Rigs Elections Posted on October 30, 2016 by Dawn Parabellum in Politics Share This \nAstonishing, newly released leaked audio of Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has just surfaced, and what it reveals is damning. In her own voice, we hear the corrupt Democrat telling reporters that elections can and should be rigged to ensure who wins. This throws the validity of every government on earth in the shredder because she isn＊t only talking about rigging American presidential elections. \nSince the FBI reopened their investigation into the criminal Democrat and Hillary seeks a powerful position to dictate the lives of others, it＊s important to hear this audio. She is blatant when she say elections shouldn＊t take place unless we make ※sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.§ \nHear it from her own mouth: \nHillary clearly said, ※I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. § \nThis conversation took place in 2006 during a discussion with Eli Chomsky, an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press. At the time, Hillary Clinton was running for a ※shoo-in re-election§ as a U.S. senator. \nHer trip, making the rounds of editorial boards, brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. Her conversation was secretly recorded, and the audio hasn＊t been released until now. \nAccording to Chomsky, this little audio clip has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. He claims his copy is the only copy and no one has heard it since 2006 〞 until now. Election rigging Democrat, Hillary Clinton \nIt proves she is willing to do whatever it takes to win. With massive amounts of voter fraud already being reported in favor of the most criminal and corrupt politician of our time, in combination with this audio, it＊s hard to deny that Hillary wouldn＊t rig the election to win. \nLuckily, Americans are wising up to her disturbing antics. We all saw her cheat during the debates , and the proof came out in leaked emails, thanks to WikiLeaks. \nIt＊s important to hear this, coming directly from Hillary herself, and we can all tell that it is her voice. We all know she＊s rigging this election to beat Donald Trump, but she obviously has had her hands in rigged elections before. \nIt is hard to say how many elections across the globe she has influenced or just stolen. Hillary Clinton will stop at nothing to grab even a small amount of power, and she continues to prove she is as corrupt as they come.",

After the FBI dropped the ball on the first investigation, they＊re redeeming themselves the second time around, and now it＊s out what she paid strange men $300 to do. \nThe hits just keep on coming at Hillary. If she gets off the hook again this investigation in addition to everything WikiLeaks has released about her, then we know that there is something seriously corrupt with our government. \nWorse yet would be if she＊s elected as president, which will force Americans to pay an exceptionally detrimental price for the next four years that could bring lasting implications. The man in this video knows who may have helped in that destructive outcome, done for a small fee that Hillary＊s campaign evidently handed out like candy for this cause at a halfway house in California. \nMicroSpookyLeaks came forward with the footage they obtained, when they posted it to social media on Saturday which shows the unnamed person in this video admitting what Democrats were giving halfway house patients $300 to do for them. While this man in the video may not have accepted the payment himself, he＊s caught saying that Democrats are giving others in the house a $300 rebate check if they vote for Hillary in the state of California.

What＊s particular sick about it isn＊t just that they are fraudulently obtaining votes for this woman who can＊t get them on her own merit, it＊s that they are targeting vulnerable people to get them as part of the dishonest plan. \nIf Hillary is able to continue on with this campaign and take the White House, Americans have the duty to demand how it happened since there＊s no way she could legitimately win. Had Donald Trump been caught bribing halfway house patients for votes or any of the other dishonest deeds leaked out about Hillary lately, the media would have exiled him from the election.",

    "text": "Share This A photo of Hillary Clinton with some police officers popped up on social media over the weekend, but people were divided in their reaction to it. The post on the Facebook page for the Medford Police Patrolmen＊s Association caused controversy and backlash online over the content and what the was seen being done to crooked Hillary. The post showed Medford Police officers at the Fall Festival in Haines Square on Saturday. The photo was done in fun and captioned, ※Look who MPD grabbed at the Fall Festival in Haines Square today＃§ This image is an accurate depiction of what we all would like to see: Hillary in handcuffs. As you can plainly see, the photos show police officers with a woman in an orange jumpsuit, handcuffed. It appears that they are arresting someone, who wore a mask in the likeness of Hillary Clinton. Screenshot from the Medford Police Patrolman＊s Facebook page \nIn a second photo, the police officers posed with a person in a Donald Trump mask, with the caption, ※Making America GREAT again in West Medford Square!!§ Screenshot from the Medford Police Patrolman＊s Facebook page \nSince a fair amount of overly sensitive pansies made a big deal about the posts, Harry MacGilvray, president of the Medford Police Patrolmen＊s Association, decided to apologize for making the post. \n※These were Halloween costumes. It was meant totally as a joke. I apologize if this offended anyone in any way,§ MacGilvray said in a statement. ※I never expected this sort of reaction. It was poor judgment on my part.§ \nThe posts have been removed to avoid hurting the feelings of overly-sensitive liberals. While most of us see the humor in these images and understand how insane it was to apologize for the posts that were clearly done in jest, liberals don＊t see things this way. \nThey go out of their way, looking to be offended. If the police posed with a handcuffed Trump, it＊s pretty obvious that there would have been no outrage, because conservatives aren＊t easily offended by free speech. However, a liberals sole purpose seems to be finding things to be offended over, and they have done it again.",

    "text": "Share This \nHillary Clinton thought her email scandal was in the rearview mirror, but it just blew up in her face days before the election. Unfortunately for her, everything just got worse as a bombshell just exploded 每 and seeing how the topic is about prison, it looks like things are about to get juicy. \nThere＊s no doubt that Hillary is as crooked as they come. Although the left would have you believe otherwise, with the presidential hopeful all but admitting her criminal acts, not too many people believe them. \nHowever, things just got a lot worse for Hillary, but his time, it＊s not only her presidential campaign that＊s in jeopardy. According to The Economic Collapse , Hillary Clinton is looking at a whopping 20 years behind bars if she＊s convicted of ※obstruction of justice§ 每 a term that could very well be a life sentence for a woman of her age. A sight we may get to see soon, and one that Hillary Clinton rightfully deserves \nAs of this point, no one is mentioning the phrase ※obstruction of justice,§ but that doesn＊t mean the idea isn＊t floating out there. In fact, when you look at the actual definition of the term in regards to the Federal statute, you start to get a better idea of just how guilty Hillary is: \nWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. \nWe already know that Hillary is guilty of trying to cover this up. Not only did she delete and ※bleachbit§ her server in a desperate attempt to block the FBI from finding out her dirty little secret, but then she said she didn＊t have the emails they were looking for. \nOf course, when others stumbled across the mythical 33,000 emails, things started to take a turn 每 and it all just got worse. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI now has another 650,000 emails to sort through with about 10,000 pertinent to Hillary＊s case. Things aren＊t looking so good for Hillary Clinton \nWhy did FBI Director James Comey find the need to come forward with this information so close to the election? Well, as it turns out, the answer is rather simple 每 redemption. \nAccording to a Daily Mail article written by Ed Klein, the author of a bestseller about the Clintons entitled Guilty As Sin , it seems as though Comey was suffering for letting off Hillary so easy. As explained by Klein: \n※Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,§ said the source. ＆They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist. He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom.§ \nFurther speculation pertaining to Comey＊s reasoning seems to indicate that the urgency here stems from the information actually found. Knowing just how much the release would impact the election, one can only assume that Comey was only comfortable in doing so as someone had already found something really big. \nThe fact of the matter is, people had lost faith in justice after Comey＊s dismissal of Hillary＊s charges. After proving that power meant exclusion from the law, it seems as though the FBI Director is trying to right that wrong today. Furthermore, as there seems to be something of substantive nature, Hillary can expect to be facing 20 years behind bars 每 a sentence a great many people would feel is justified.",

    "text": "Share This \nAfter the FBI＊s Friday announcement that they had reopened their investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s private email server, many have been quick to attack director James Comey for the timing of his recent move. However, Trey Gowdy just obliterated the criticisms while also delivering a nasty surprise directly to Hillary herself. \nThe Democrats have come unhinged as they watch their candidate sink, with the FBI＊s reopened investigation delivering a devastating blow to an already disastrous campaign. In fact, what＊s coming out of their mouths as they enter panic mode is almost laughable. Take for instance Howard Dean＊s claim that Comey is in cahoots with Vladimir Putin or Harry Reid＊s suggestion that director Comey broke the law. \nIt＊s rather ironic that he＊s concerned about Comey following the law while, at the same time, basically suggesting Hillary should get a free pass. In fact, Reid is so concerned about the FBI director＊s actions in investigating Hillary Clinton＊s criminality that he had the nerve to write Comey, attempting to intimidate him. ※I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election,§ Reid wrote. ※Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.§ \nLuckily for us, Trey Gowdy was ready to call Reid out for his crap, and of course, it＊s all on video for us to enjoy. Watch: \nGowdy wasn＊t falling for the left＊s excuses, and he said what we were all thinking. First, he laid into Huma Abedin＊s excuse that she didn＊t know how her emails could have ended up on a device she says belongs to her husband. As Gowdy points out, there aren＊t that many ways it could happen, but it＊s rather irrelevant since that＊s not what the FBI is investigating. \nNext, Gowdy took out John Podesta for his ※blame the cops§ play, and then came the nasty surprise for Hillary. Gowdy reminded viewers that Comey isn＊t responsible for a single one of the facts , saying, ※ He didn＊t tell her to use a private server, he didn＊t tell Huma not to turn over all of her devices, and God knows, he didn＊t tell Anthony Weiner to send sexually explicit texts to allegedly underage people. § Gowdy continued to put Hillary on blast, saying ※ The timing is a direct and natural consequence of decisions Hillary Clinton made ,§ reminding everyone of where our focus and blame should be. But, he wasn＊t done there. \nIt was then Harry Reid＊s turn to feel the Gowdy heat as the senator ripped into Reid＊s asinine letter to Comey. ※Thank God he＊s leaving is my initial reaction,§ Gowdy said about Reid before adding, ※My second reaction is: I did not know Mormons used drugs, and anyone who is capable of sending out that press release has to be under the influence of something.§ \nThen, Gowdy went right back to putting the attention and blame where it needs to be 〞 on Hillary Clinton. ※ The person responsible for this fact pattern is Secretary Clinton ,§ Gowdy explained. ※Jim Comey did not tell her to use her private server. He did not say to mislead the public about whether or not you turned over all of your work emails. And he certainly didn＊t say, Secretary Clinton, why don＊t you say you neither sent nor received classified information.§ \nTrey Gowdy successfully obliterated any critics of the FBI and director James Comey while also delivering Hillary the nasty surprise she deserves. Although she＊s used to skirting consequences, she has no one to blame for what＊s happening besides herself, and it＊s nice to see that there are those in Washington, D.C., who are more than willing to wrap up some personal accountability and drop it directly into the presidential candidate＊s lap. Timing wouldn＊t be an issue if her own actions didn＊t lead our entire country down this path. Hillary Clinton has no one but herself to blame for what she＊s facing. As for timing, now maybe Mrs. Clinton has a little idea what it＊s like to be aborted just days before delivery.",

    "text": "8 Catastrophic Signs Reveal Hillary＊s Campaign Is IMPLODING Posted on October 31, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics Share This \nFor months now, we＊ve been patiently waiting for the scandal that would finally bring down Hillary Clinton. With the media constantly in her back pocket, she＊s miraculously been able to keep anything from sticking. However, in an ironic twist, a member of her own party in the form of Anthony Weiner appears to be the force that will finally deliver the death blow to Hillary＊s presidential bid. \nOver the weekend, we got the incredible news that the FBI would be re-opening their investigation into Hillary after new pertinent emails were uncovered while authorities were investigating Anthony Weiner. Although Hillary would love for everyone to believe that everything is just peachy and she＊s on the road to victory, there are catastrophic signs beginning to emerge, revealing that Hillary＊s campaign is literally imploding from within. \nJust in time for Halloween, here are the top 8 signs that show Hillary＊s campaign is blowing up in her face, and that the long-awaited karma train has finally begun to run her over. 1. Hillary＊s Right-hand Woman Huma Abedin Is Suddenly MIA \nIt＊s rare that we ever see Huma departed from Hillary＊s side, but the love affair between the two appears to be crashing down, now that Huma＊s own husband Anthony Weiner is the wrecking ball that＊s currently crashing through Hillary＊s campaign. According to reports, Huma has voided her immunity deal with the FBI, meaning that she has two choices: start singing or face jail time. Hillary obviously doesn＊t want Huma around to tarnish her campaign, and in the light of everything imploding, Huma is nowhere to be found. 2. Rats Are Jumping Ship \nEven Democrats are starting to renounce their support from Hillary. On Sunday night, prominent Democratic pollster Doug Schoen, who advised Bill Clinton and worked on Hillary＊s campaign from back in 2008, announced he would be withdrawing his endorsement. Schoen went on to say on FOX news that he ※fears a constitutional crisis§ should Hillary be elected into office, while still under investigation from the FBI. 3. Early Hillary Voters Are Switching To Trump \nReports are now flooding in revealing that many early voters in key swing battleground states such as Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania are now switching their votes to Trump. The search on Google ※change early vote§ is now beginning to trend. According to one alarming poll, 24% of the 18,029 people polled said they would be ditching Hillary in the light of recent events. 4. WikiLeaks Promises Leak This Week That Will Put Hillary In Jail \nHillary＊s incredibly been able to downplay the majority of WikiLeaks＊ influx of incriminating email dumps over the past few weeks. Now, WikiLeaks is promising the long-awaited ※October Surprise§ that will hit sometime this week, along with the assertion that what＊s in these emails will land Hillary in jail. 5. Trump Is Slaughtering Hillary In Florida \nIt＊s absolutely imperative that Trump wins in Florida if he＊s to secure the number of electoral votes necessary to defeat Hillary. While Hillary and the Democrats flaunted their early lead in that state several weeks ago, Trump is now up by a whopping 4 points. His lead skyrocketed after the FBI＊s announcement of their reinvestigation into Hillary＊s private server. 6. Hillary＊s Hitting The Bars \nWhat better way to drown out the reality that you＊re losing then slamming back a few whiskey sours? During a campaign stop in Florida where only an embarrassing handful of people turned out to see Hillary, she hit up a Florida bar in the middle of the day where she was seen knocking back liquor-heavy drinks. 7. Hillary Loses 11 Points In ONE WEEK \nLiberals love their polls, but even with their heavily-biased fake numbers that previously had Hillary in the ※lead,§ even they cannot keep up the lie anymore. In a catastrophic new poll from Washington Post/ABC, Hillary has dropped an astounding 11 points in ONE WEEK! Oh, the horror! 8. Voters Are Screaming ※LOCK HER UP!§ \nBefore hitting up the bar in Florida, Hillary was greeted by angry voters who began chanting ※lock her up!§ True to form, Hillary just ignored the group of angry Americans, while plastering on the biggest fakest toothiest smile she could muster. \nIt＊s so wonderful when karma finally comes calling. Unfortunately for Hillary, it looks like her dose of karma is deciding to hit with just a little over a week before the presidential election. Oh, how sweet it is! Follow Us On Social Media Search",

Unfortunately for Hillary Clinton, this badass pumpkin seemed to center around her 每 and it will surely knock the socks right off any trick-or-treater headed to their house tonight. \nHalloween is a fun time for many people 每 especially families with younger ones. However, it seems that a few homeowners decided to try and entertain the adults that may cross their path. Proving just that is a video shared to the Facebook page called ※ Uncle Sam＊s Misguided Children ,§ which shows how one person went political with theirs. \nAs can be seen in the short clip , the jack-o-lantern was emptied and carved to look like a set of jail bars. Making it just that much better, the person responsible for carving the pumpkin actually stuffed a picture of Hillary in there to make it appear as though she is in prison 每 where she belongs. \nWithin just a few short days, the video has already been seen over 3 million times with that number on the rise. However, if you think people on social media are ramped up over the ingenious carving, you can imagine the reactions that thing will get from trick-or-treaters tonight. \nAs it turns out, the cool idea actually sparked a bit of a movement with several other people doing the same. In fact, in order to make it crystal clear, others even wrote the words ※Hillary 4 Prison§ on their creations as well:",

With a warning sounded last night about the initiation of ※phase 3§ from the website, which has been leaking devastating emails about Hillary＊s insiders, the ※election dump§ promises to be the one that brings her to her knees. \nWikileaks announced on Twitter that it would soon launch ※phase three of [its] election coverage.§ The tweet also asked those who wish to see more dumps to donate to the site to assist with their funding. The tweet read, ※We commence phase 3 of our US election coverage next week.§ We commence phase 3 of our US election coverage next week. You can contribute: https://t.co/MsNZhrTzTL @WLTaskForce pic.twitter.com/XferJnMGux \n〞 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 30, 2016 \nThis dump is supposed to be even more damaging to the already flailing political career of Hillary Clinton. Wikileaks supporters now include a number of disgruntled Republican voters and Bernie Sanders supporters. \nImmediately after the site announced this dump, several WikiLeaks followers replied with tweets expressing hope that phase three would ultimately damage Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ＆s campaign for good. However, some expressed concern that it could be too little, too late. @wikileaks @WLTaskForce by next week, I assume you mean tomorrow, and not 3 days before the election. Near 30%+ in some states already voted \n〞 Mel (@melimel521) October 30, 2016 \nNew archives of emails released to the public would definitely devastate the Clinton campaign even further, and after the FBI＊s announcement that they will reopen the investigation against Hillary, it could be the straw which breaks the camel＊s back. \nSo far, no amount of corruption or criminal activity has gotten devout Democrat voters to see Hillary for who she is: a power hungry sociopath. She has been caught rigging elections across the globe and cheating to get the Democrat nomination. It＊s even been proven, thanks to WikiLeaks, that she cheated during the debates against Donald Trump . \nThere is some speculation that the emails released this time won＊t all be Hillary Clinton related, eluding to the possibility of even more Democrats and their corruption being exposed. Hillary Clinton＊s rigged podium helped her cheat during the debates with Donald Trump \nHackers who have taken responsibility for the hacks of John Podesta＊s emails may have more up their sleeves. Guccifer 2.0, who claims to be a lone Romanian male, was also involved in the hack on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \nHopefully, these leaks will finally get Democrat voters to realize who they have been bowing down to over the past few years. Accessing the leaked emails is not difficult, in fact, I personally check the new dumps daily. If Democrats cared half as much about honesty and integrity as they did about making sure we have the first female president, Hillary would already be no more than a stain on American history.",

Unfortunately for her, it＊s all going down mere days before the election for her desired presidency. As she faces this harsh but deserved reality, she encountered several Trump supporters in Pompano Beach, Florida, who chanted 3 brutal words, and her reaction is proof that she＊s guilty of it all. \nWith only a little over a week to go before America votes for our next president, Hillary Clinton＊s campaign is publically imploding.

Of course, Hillary does the opposite as she has many years of practice on how to ignore people who call her out for her wrongdoings. \nClearly, when FBI Director James Comey dropped his bombshell, reopening her criminal investigation, Hillary became frantic and desperate. She knows what she＊s done and how guilty she is. \nNow, all she can do is pray nothing more comes to light before the big election. Sorry Hillary, not even your followers can be that dumb.

    "text": "BAD NEWS: Hillary＊s Pimping Past Exposed, Dirty Whoring Details Leaked Posted on October 31, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This \nIf Hillary Clinton thought she was in big trouble with the FBI, she＊s got another thing coming when she hears what＊s just around the corner. In fact, it seems as though the presidential hopeful＊s pimping past was just leaked 每 and every whoring detail is out there for the world to see. \nHillary is no saint, despite what she would have you believe, and her apparent pimping past goes to prove just that. According to a recent leak, it seems that the female presidential wannabe is used to whoring out certain entities 每 so long as she gets to stuff her pockets. \nSo, who exactly did Hillary force to grab their ankles so that she could rake in millions of dollars? Well, America 每 more specifically, the American working class. As explained by The Daily Caller , Hillary accepted a whopping $28 million donation to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for 2 favors granted to the country of Morocco. Bill Clinton (center right) and Hillary Clinton (center left) greet Mohammed VI, King of Morocco (right), and his sister, Lalla Meryem (left) \nCome to find out, the first part of the payment came in at $15 million from the country＊s King Mohammed VI. Just after that, Hillary miraculously got to work on the Mosaic Company 每 America＊s largest phosphate mining facility. For those unaware, phosphates are used in a variety of products but are most well known for being used to make fertilizer for farmers. \nAs it turns out, one of Morocco＊s largest bases for income just so happens to be the selling of phosphates that they illegally rip from their lands. In order to put pressure on Mosaic, in hopes of shutting them down, Hillary deployed the use of both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in an effort to deem the group an ※environmental threat§ to our country. \nIn order to do so, Hillary had the DHS fly planes low over Mosaic＊s operations in order to spy on them. From there, EPA chief Lisa Jackson got to putting the crunch on the organization by making their lives a living hell in every single way. Hillary Clinton \nIn the meantime, Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to relax U.S. foreign aid restrictions on Morocco, thereby allowing the country to expand operations into phosphate mining. By the end, the American company was to be shut down, forcing America to look elsewhere for supply 每 which, if you can connect the dots, would be where Morocco would come sweeping in. \nFortunately, Florida politicians were able to fight back and put the brakes on before tens of thousands of Americans were negatively influenced by the devious deed. However, Hillary and the King of Morocco weren＊t done there as he pumped another few million into the Clinton Foundation＊s account. \nAs explained by The Daily Caller : \nAn email WikiLeaks made public last week illustrated how Clinton, while acting as secretary of state, negotiated an additional $12 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from Muhammed in return for holding the 2015 Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) meeting in Marrakech, Morocco. \nHillary also managed to squeeze another $1 million out of the King to cover the expenses of the CGI meeting. As one would imagine, the recent leak hasn＊t made too many people happy, and it exposed how Hillary has been whoring out our nation any way she can in order to further fill her own pockets. \nAccording to Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, ※these facts seem to reveal the possibility of more pay-to-play activities at the Clinton Foundation.§ Personally, I don＊t understand why we can＊t call this what it is 每 bribery. \nUsing fancy terms takes away from the criminal behavior that Hillary has been complicit in. Furthermore, she has proven that she is perfectly comfortable with illegal behavior 每 as well as pimping out the American people, specifically the working class 每 so long as she benefits from it. If she did all this in just the short time she was Secretary of State, I shudder to think what she will do with the full power of the presidency behind her.",

    "title": "Trump Voter Arrested When Officials See What His Shirt Says About Hillary",
    "text": "Share This A Trump supporter was arrested after polling officials spotted what he was wearing at an early voting station in Bulverde, Texas. \nAs the election draws near, liberals are attempting to stifle any votes for Hillary Clinton＊s increasingly popular opponent, Donald Trump, hoping their felonious candidate can pull off a win. However, what a Trump supporter was recently arrested for wearing shows just how desperate leftists really are to stop the conservative vote. \nWhen Brett Mauthe woke up last Monday morning, he was eager to get his ballot in early and secure a vote for Trump while the Republican nominee＊s approval rate continues to rise. The 55-year-old Texan got dressed, put on his favorite hat, and headed out the door. Unfortunately, he didn＊t realize that it was his choice of clothing that would not only prohibit him from voting but also land him inside a jail cell. \nKSAT 12 reports that Bulverde polling officials confronted Mauthe when they spotted him wearing a pro-Trump hat and a t-shirt that read ※Basket of Deplorables,§ a sarcastic reference to Hillary＊s crude remarks about conservative voters. Apparently unaware that he wasn＊t allowed to sport campaign gear inside the polling station, Mauthe removed his hat but refused to turn his shirt inside out. It was then that the officials called the police and had him arrested. \nMauthe was placed in cuffs and charged with electioneering and loitering as local police threw the book at the confused man. Like Mauthe, voters at the same polling place were shocked that wearing such clothing is not only prohibited at the polls but can result in a misdemeanor charge . Brett Mauthe, 55, was charged with electioneering and loitering for wearing a ※Basket of Deplorables§ t-shirt mocking Hillary Clinton＊s crude reference to conservatives. \n※I don＊t feel like you should be preaching to anybody, but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate,§ Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote Wednesday morning. ※I＊m kind of shocked because I think that＊s part of the freedoms that we＊re voting for. ※ \nWhile Mauthe is wholly responsible for not following the rules, although he may not have understood the severity of his violation, we＊re betting that career politicians are keen on the election rules. Proving that the liberal elites are above the rules, Hillary herself was caught breaking the same law as Mauthe but with a very different outcome. This year, Hillary was caught campaigning in front of a North Carolina polling station and Bill was busted thanking Hillary voters over a loudspeaker within 20 feet of a Massachusetts polling station. Unlike Mauthe, neither of the Clintons were arrested. \nMad World News reported that Hillary was captured on video campaigning in front of Raleigh＊s Chavis Center, a polling place in North Carolina. The female candidate walked straight up to early voters, greeting them and snapping selfies as if she was at one of her own rallies. Of course, the scheming doesn＊t end there. \nIn March of this year, Bill was busted thanking ※those of you who are supporting Hillary Clinton§ with a loudspeaker while within 20 feet of a Massachusetts polling station. His massive police detail also blocked civilians from entering the precinct to vote. The Daily Kos reports that even though electioneering, which is Mauthe＊s crime, is only a misdemeanor, interfering with voting rights is a felony, which is exactly what Bill did. As expected, Mauthe was arrested and charged for his crimes, but Bill was fawned over and even abetted by police officers. \nAlthough Mauthe definitely broke the law when he refused to remove his shirt, his real crime is that he wasn＊t a Hillary supporter. If he had been a liberal celebrity or the husband of a Democratic politician, he would＊ve been allowed to block voters and openly campaign for his choice right there in the station. \nThe bias is clear a?? not only are the electronic polling machines switching votes for the left, influential Democrats are potentially changing views right there in the polling stations. It＊s undeniable that, regardless of the results, the American people don＊t stand a chance at a fair election.",

    "text": "Top Hillary Official Leads Prayer Chain Hoping To Save Imploding Campaign Posted on October 31, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics Share This \nDemocrats are constantly attacking Christianity while fighting to have God completely removed from our institutions, and evidence of their godless agenda was on full display during the Democratic National Convention, when they removed all references to God. However, now that Hillary＊s campaign is imploding, Democrats are evoking the name of God, as a last-ditch effort to save her campaign. \nIt doesn＊t take a brain surgeon to see that Hillary and her presidential race is going down in flames. She continues to drop in the polls, while many of her previous supporters are now ditching her and flocking to early voting stations to cast their votes for Trump. As things progressively spiral out of control in the aftermath of the FBI reopening their investigation, chairwoman for the DNC is now calling on Hillary supporters to evoke the name of God and pray for ※divine intervention§ to save crooked Hillary＊s deteriorating presidential campaign. \nShortly after news broke of the FBI＊s decision, chairwoman Donna Brazile immediately jumped on Twitter, leading liberals in somewhat of a social media prayer chain for Hillary. As evidenced by the heart and retweet buttons, Hillary＊s supporters echoed the sentiments of Brazile＊s desperate plea for God＊s divine intervention to save Hillary＊s imploding campaign. Please God, let this end soon \n〞 Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 30, 2016 \nUnfortunately, Brazile wasn＊t done mocking God quite yet. It looks like she even dusted off her Bible to find a verse she could twist for her political use, as she then blasted lines from the book of Psalms, accompanied with a frantic message to Hillary supporters to get out and vote. Exhaling every time I get distracted. Let's work until the midnight hour. Are you fired up and ready to vote? Keep you eyes on the prize! https://t.co/wnSixsJYu3 \n〞 Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 30, 2016 \nNow, I＊m no Biblical scholar, but I do know that God explicitly states in the Bible that he will not be mocked. Being that the Democratic Party is the epitome of evil as the original proponents of slavery and abortion, it＊s truly asinine that these idiots think God is suddenly going to have their backs and assist them with getting the evilest and vilest person on planet earth elected into the White House. \nTrump supporters were quick to catch the absolute irony of Brazile＊s Twitter antics and immediately began firing back with some hilarious responses of their own: @donnabrazile Please golden, sweet Jesus＃ #DrainTheSwamp quickly!! Let's all #MakeAmericaGreatAgain and get these criminals out of here! pic.twitter.com/wsf3zx26LL \n〞 Erica AmERICA (@EricaMelone) October 30, 2016 @donnabrazile Yes let's pray! Pray for God's justice and that @HillaryClinton is put in prison where she belongs! \n〞 ∵ Prissy Holly ∵ (@PrissyHolly) October 31, 2016 @PrayInFaith This is true if one is serving The God of Abraham, Isaac & Jacob! Does God support reprobate & criminal behavior? \n〞 Joe Butler (@jdb1964) October 31, 2016 @PrayInFaith I can't imagine God would want a corrupt person such as HRC running this country. \n〞 Deplorable Kimie (@kimieand) October 31, 2016 @PrayInFaith God cannot honor this corruption which is out there for all eyes. I pray for America to be protected from her. \n〞 Lou Stevens (@LouMalpagato) October 31, 2016 \nNice try, Democrats. Maybe if you hadn＊t made it your number 1 priority to erase God from our schools and governmental institutions in recent years, He might look down favorably upon you now, in your darkest hour. \nAs for me, I will continue to get on my knees every night, begging for God＊s mercy and asking not for my will but for His will to be done. Being that God is on the side of justice, I seriously doubt that if Hillary does manage to win, that He would have had anything to do in assisting in that devastating outcome!",

    "text": "Hillary Horrified As 2 Pics Surfaced Overnight That She Didn＊t Want Out Posted on October 31, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Worried Hillary Clinton (left), Vindicated Donald Trump (right) \nHillary Clinton got a Halloween surprise early when she turned on her computer and saw what was on Google. While she slept, forgetting about everything that came against her on Friday when the FBI decided to re-investigate her emails and private server, someone else was taking full advantage of the situation and exposing the truth about her as two posts showed. \nAfter Barack Obama gave control of the Internet to International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), Hillary may have thought that her secrets would be safe. As WikiLeaks continues to prove, that couldn＊t be further from the truth. Clever conservative web users are alive and well, working hard to expose the secrets that she＊s enjoyed keeping behind closed doors before the Internet came along and swung them wide open, exposing the scandalous and criminal behavior that she almost got away with. \nSince Google tends to lean left and caters to liberal agendas, it＊s not often that the search results you＊re looking for are all that accurate. However, on Sunday, almost 36 hours after news broke about the FBI investigating Hillary, if you were to search two separate terms, the results were awesomely accurate. \nA tricky hacker managed to mess with the algorithm so that if anyone was looking for the definition of ※pathological liar§ on the popular search engine, the top result showed Hillary＊s headshot alongside the description, but that wasn＊t all. @triplejHack What in the Wide World of Sports is going on with Google!? pic.twitter.com/PJHC23CzDK \n〞 Dilo on Fire (@FireDilo) October 31, 2016 \nThe definition of this term said, ※It is a stand-alone disorder as well as a symptom of other disorders such as psychopathy and antisocial, narcissistic, and historic personality disorders, but people who are pathological liars may not possess characteristics of the other disorders. Excessive lying is a common symptom of several mental disorders.§ While that description may always come up in Google for ※Pathological liar,§ Hillary＊s picture isn＊t typically there, but it is the perfect example of the mental illness. \nAdding to the insult was another search result the hacker altered for better accuracy. When searching for who the ※45th President§ is, Donald Trump＊s picture showed up, which Hillary probably wasn＊t too happy about. The comparison between the two searches perfectly represents both presidential candidates. With any luck, the results will stay the same after November 8 and the treatment for Hillary＊s diagnosis of ※pathological liar§ will be prison time.",

She＊s not letting a holiday like Halloween hold her back from her scheduled speaking engagements, scaring everyone she meets with what she inadvertently decided to dress up as. \nThe troubled Democratic candidate showed up at Kent State University to greet another anemic crowd that she＊s become accustomed to seeing. While she thought she was treating them with her presence, the ※trick§ was actually on her when everyone took a closer look at what she was wearing and saw the irony in it based on everything Americans have seen over recent weeks. \nWhile she didn＊t depart from her typical androgynous pantsuit garb, there was something else about her outfit hidden in plain sight. As the American Mirror point out, every inch of the draping fabric she had on was crimson red, making her appear like she dressed as a walking blood clot for Halloween. \nSince clots have been suspected as contributing to her health issues, which she＊s had a hard time hiding, the irony of the outfit wasn＊t lost on those looking for deeper meaning in what she picked to wear on this particular holiday. Hillary Clinton in all crimson red at Kent State today on Halloween \nAccording to The Sun , Hillary has been known to have clotting issues in the past when they reported on this condition in September. ※Clinton had a long history of ill health starting with a blood clot in 1998 while her husband Bill was commander-in-chief,§ the source explained. ※The ＆Venous thromboembolism＊, which was located behind her right knee, resulted in her foot ballooning in size.§ \nThe article added that Hillary is on a daily regimen of blood-thinning medications to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) ※after suffering two other clots in 2009 and 2012,§ one of which was discovered in her brain. \nThe symbolism potentially runs deep in this color choice as it＊s one of her few appearances she＊s made since Friday when the FBI announced that they were looking back into her e-mails, which possibly mean the end of the road for her. Red represents anger, which she surely feels inside, or perhaps it＊s a hidden message that the election will end with a win for Republicans whose party is represented by this bold color.",

Hillary is so pissed, she has been on a tirade, blasting Comey and Donald Trump, but she forgot one thing 〞 and that is the one person who really screwed her. Hillary Clinton is pissed off. \nPoor Hillary Clinton, since stepping into the White House back in 1992, she has imagined herself sitting in the Oval Office as the one with all the power. She has conspired and broken laws, killed men in Benghazi, and lied about their deaths, but now, it looks like its all for nothing. \nIf only she could live in reality for 20 seconds, she would realize the one person who screwed her was staring back at her in the mirror. Everything that has happened is because she decided or rather insisted that all her crimes involving her own home based server be covered up. \nShe was warned when she became Secretary of State that all emails having to do with government business must go through the ※dot gov§ system. She had to take a class on how to handle classified documents, and after the class, she had to sign a document confirming that she understood all of her work emails must stay on the ※dot gov§ system. \nWhy? Was this just a stupid rule that had no real life consequences? No. People＊s lives are at risk. Our troop＊s movements are in those emails. The information about CIA spies, who are risking their lives in foreign countries, are in those emails. Who needs a class to understand what is at stake? \nSo, how can she get pissed off about this investigation and say over and over ※it was a mistake, there is no case with the FBI§? A mistake? A mistake is an action or judgment that is misguided or wrong. Intentionally going against all protocols and putting the lives of others in danger is a crime. Hillary Clinton in August 2015 \nHere＊s what Rush Limbaugh said: \n※They＊ve nominated somebody that＊s under constant FBI investigation, and there are four different investigations into the Clinton Foundation. Do not doubt me when I tell you that within the inner circles of the Democrat Party, they are very worried about this. Even if she gets elected, they＊re very worried about it, because of what it portends for her presidency. This woman is corrupt. She and her husband are constantly engaged in things that place them under investigation, for 30 years .§ [via Rush Limbaugh.com ] \nHillary is so pissed off, but for those of us who have suffered through watching her tear apart this nation, sell influence to foreign entities in the ※pay for play§ scandals, leave our men in Benghazi to die while blaming it on a video, and lie under oath numerous times, well, we couldn＊t be happier. \nAmerican women have no business voting for Hillary as the first woman American president. What kind of a legacy is that for our daughters and granddaughters? How will those women who backed her and voted for her ever explain that the first woman president was the biggest criminal ever to hold that office? \nShe is a monster, and I＊m tired of her supporters crying now that it＊s falling apart. The only person to blame is Hillary Clinton, and anyone who can＊t see her clearly is delusional. No one made her commit crimes that she needed to cover up with a home based server. Put her in prison, where she belongs, and throw away the keys.",

It all stems from an alleged affair Bill Clinton had with a black Arkansas prostitute, which produced a son. Now, after years of trying to find out the truth about his biological father, the rumored son＊s cause is being taken up by a black rapper, and they have a really bad surprise for Hillary. Rapper ※Freenauts§ wears ※Hillary for Prison§ t-shirt while performing rap song ※Justice For Danney Williams§ \nThe BLM rapper ※Freenauts,§ wearing a ※Hillary for Prison§ t-shirt, put out a video, performing his rap song ※Justice for Danney Williams,§ referring to Bill Clinton＊s alleged lovechild. The video has just over 100,000 views, but now that it is the last week before the election, Donald Trump supporters, as well as Black Lives Matter supporters, are posting it all over social media. \nThe plight of Arkansas resident Danney Williams has been around for years, and in the past, Hillary＊s henchmen put out disinformation to the press to make it seem as if Williams claims had been proven false. \nIn fact, Danney Williams has never had a DNA test, and many in the media are now realizing that not only does Williams resemble Clinton but his story rings true. Up until Bill Clinton became president, Williams recalls with great detail the Christmas presents Arkansas troopers would bring to his house from then-Governor Bill Clinton. Growing up, Williams was told by his mother and even his teachers that he was Bill Clinton＊s son.

Unfortunately for her, it looks like that may happen after WND made this announcement from Williams: \nDanney Williams, the man from Little Rock, Arkansas, who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black illegitimate son of former President Bill Clinton, will hold a press conference Tuesday at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., to make an announcement his supporters characterize as a ※bombshell that will rock Hillary＊s campaign.§ \nOn October 19, WND reported that lawyers representing Williams, in the hours before the third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas, announced their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. \nIt looks like Hillary may be in for a drop in support by African-Americans after Williams describes her as the mean woman who chased his mother away from the Governor＊s mansion when he was only a few years old. It may be a day of reckoning for Hillary as everything that can go wrong is all happening at once, and we couldn＊t be happier. May Hillary get everything she deserves and then some.",

    "text": "Sex Bombshell Exposed After Hillary Couldn＊t Hide What She Did Back In 2011 Posted on October 31, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This \nHillary Clinton is backpedaling these days, but her past isn＊t making things any easier on her. In fact, it seems that her dirty deeds from 2011 just came to the surface in the form of a sex bombshell 每 and not even she could hide it forever. \nWith the FBI reopening its investigation into Hillary＊s emails and private server, on account of another case into Anthony Weiner＊s sexting of an alleged minor, it seems that there are some startling details coming forward. Although we all know that Weiner is a long-time pervert and sexual predator, it looks like things have been going on for longer than we thought 每 and Hillary knew about it all along. Everyone who knew Anthony Weiner targeted underage girls back in 2011: John Podesta, Neera Tanden, and Hillary Clinton (left), and Jennifer Palmieri (right) \nAccording to Mail Online , Hillary＊s camp knew that Weiner was talking to and sending sexually graphic images to an underage girl all the way back in 2011, yet they did nothing to stop him. In fact, Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign communications director in 2011, sent an email to John Podesta, now chair of Clinton＊s presidential campaign, and Neera Tanden, another Clinton adviser, detailing Weiner＊s predatory and criminal behavior. \nMarried to Hillary＊s current top aide, Huma Abedin, at the time, Weiner＊s indiscretions were made public knowledge to Hillary＊s camp and only met with a mere ※oof§ from Podesta. Further reports indicate that police were sent to the 17-year-old girl＊s home at the time to interview both the child and her parents. Anthony Weiner and his sex pics \nOf course, as we all know now, Weiner has come under official investigation after sending lewd messages to a different 15-year-old girl more recently. However, one can only wonder if Weiner＊s most recent victim could have been spared if his predatory behavior was addressed back in 2011 rather than swept under the rug. \nAlthough he＊s been widely deemed the black sheep of the political realm, it certainly appears that his divorce and early resignation was the least of concern pertaining to the fallout of his behavior. Seeing how the most recent of Weiner＊s consequences just slapped Hillary, it doesn＊t take much to imagine the hell he＊s living in right now. Anthony Weiner and steamy messages he sent to a woman other than his wife \nHowever, it is good to have these things out in the open as it helps show the true Hillary Clinton 每 the one she never wanted you to know about. There＊s no question that Hillary would do whatever it took to remain in power, but this is just ridiculous. \nBecause of her neglect and the blind eye turned by her staff, an underage girl was allowed to be victimized because the truth would have a negative effect on them. There really is no jail cell that＊s suited for what Hillary deserves but she will most certainly have to answer for her misdeeds after she＊s dead and gone from this earth 每 and suffering for an eternity sounds rather fitting for the vile things she＊s done.",

It＊s becoming harder for her to hide who she really is, despite having done a pretty good job of it up until this campaign, but now we know how she deals with her many challenges after what Booker recorded her doing right before a campaign rally. \nThe Democratic candidate was in New Jersey on June 1 for one of her few campaign stops at the time and seemed to have some ※help§ with getting through the challenges of her day.

    "text": "Liberals Brag With Pic Of Hillary, FURIOUS At What Snuck In Behind Her Posted on November 1, 2016 by Alisha Rich in Politics Share This \nIt＊s been a rough week for crooked Hillary Clinton, and things only seem to be getting worse. She＊s panicking behind closed doors, and things are now spiraling out of control after a popular liberal newspaper attempted to brag about the presidential hopeful by using a picture of her in Florida. However, liberals were left furious when they realized what snuck in behind her in the photo. \nHillary Clinton stopped at an early voting location to do a little last-minute campaigning in Pompano Beach, Florida. When The New York Times obtained a picture of Hillary at the event, they decided to run the picture in their newspaper. However, the editors made one massive mistake that left them not only furious but embarrassed as to what they had accidentally published behind Hillary in the picture \nAccording to The Gateway Pundit , ※You know the wheels are falling off your crooked campaign when the far left NY Times§ publishes a picture of Hillary Clinton surrounded by Trump supporters. At least six Trump signs can be seen in the photo, making them hard to miss, but liberals have been known to turn a blind eye to obvious things, such as the dirty deeds of their crooked candidate. \nAs Mad World News has previously reported, Hillary＊s problems only got worse when those Trump supporters were heard chanting three brutal words, ※Lock her up.§ Of course, she chose to ignore their bold statement and focused on her few supporters who were in attendance and were mildly excited for her presence. \nClearly, Hillary Clinton＊s campaign is imploding and her chances of being elected as the next president are getting smaller and smaller on a daily basis. Obviously, it＊s her own fault. \nPerhaps if she had learned how to be a bit more honest and a lot less corrupt, she wouldn＊t have anything to worry about from the FBI or the American voters. However, that＊s not the case for the crooked Clinton, and it＊s becoming a no-brainer that Donald Trump is going to be in the Oval Office, working to make America great again.",

    "title": "New Leak Exposes Hillary＊s Real Plan For Clinton Foundation Foreign Donors",
    "text": "Share This \nThe Clinton Foundation and its foreign donors have been an area of concern should Hillary Clinton become president due to accusations of pay-to-play scandals. Knowing this, Hillary gave her word that the Clinton Foundation would stop accepting foreign donations should she be elected president. However, a new leak just exposed her real plan for foreign donors, and it＊s not looking good. Hillary Clinton \nOnce again, Hillary has landed herself in the middle of more scandalous activity. With the FBI reopening her email and private server investigation and WikiLeaks continuously exposing her corruption, she can＊t seem to catch a break 〞 and she shouldn＊t. Her long list of scandals continues to grow, as should her nose, after being busted lying to the American people yet again to manipulate her way into our White House. \nAccording to a leaked memo, Hillary＊s words mean nothing. Although she promised that the Clinton Foundation would cease accepting foreign donations if she were to be elected president, a leaked memo has exposed her real plans and proven that she didn＊t mean what she said. Two-faced Hillary told the public one thing, while her secret plan was for something much different. \nThanks to WikiLeaks, the truth is again being revealed after the organization published an email that was sent to John Podesta, the Clinton Campaign chair. The email contained the leaked memo, which appears to have been crafted by Cheryl Mills, a Clinton aide, who wrote, ※I connected with HRC this am regarding the steps she will take with regard to the Foundation should she announce a decision to explore a run for the Presidency,§ just days before Hillary announced her run for president. \nAlthough she＊s said otherwise throughout her campaign, Hillary＊s personal preference, as indicated by the leaked memo dated April 7, 2015, is for the foundation to continue accepting money from foreign governments, The Daily Caller reports, and this could mean bad news for Hillary as five FBI field offices are currently investigating her ※nonprofit§ foundation due to pay-to-play allegations, although the Department of Justice did their best to suppress investigations into the corrupt Clinton Foundation. \nThe leaked memo clearly shows that Hillary indicated to staffers that her personal preference is for the foundation to continue to accept money from foreign governments, even if she is elected president . What＊s worse, the corrupt Clintons were hesitant to limit the foundation＊s financial operations in any way, as the memo says, Hillary ※does not want to limit the Foundation＊s ability to operate programs now or in the future,§ adding, ※ we don＊t want to close the door to unexpected opportunities. § \nThe memo goes on to mention a ※compromise§ option, where it says they could ※say that the Foundation will not accept contributions from foreign governments unless that funding is part of an ongoing program or a disbursement for a completed negotiation.§ However, under that option, the foundation would continue to accept money from Qatar despite Hillary＊s own admission that the country is financially supporting ISIS . \nThe ※final option§ mentioned ※would mirror the 2008 [Memorandum of Understanding] agreement whereby the Foundation submits new foreign government contributions and those of a substantial size increase to an independent body (e.g. White House, State Department) for review. The obvious challenge with this is that there is no independent body to make that review.§ However, as The Daily Caller notes, Hillary ※did not uphold her end of the 2008 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU),§ and even liberal-leaning PolitiFact ruled the claim that Hillary acted in accordance with the 2008 MOU ※mostly false.§ \nWhen is enough, enough? The Clinton crime family will never change their ways and their fake foundation is only a front for their shady deals. The Clintons＊ greed for money and power is endless and nothing 〞 not even our laws 〞 will stand in the way of Hillary and Bill as they grab as much of both as they can. There＊s only one place Hillary belongs while on this earth, and that＊s not the Oval Office, it＊s a cinderblock cell. After her time there is done, she has a one-way ticket to hell, where she probably hopes to overthrow the devil. That is how evil, corrupt, and power hungry she is. Her deceit and depravity know no bounds, and she would even give the devil a run for his money. Do you really want that kind of person to be our next president?",

    "text": "Obama and Justice Dept. Busted In Rigging Plot After Hillary Memo Leaks Posted on November 1, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics Share This \nOver the weekend, many of us were left cheering over the news that the FBI was reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton＊s private server. Unfortunately, our celebrating might be short lived. Democrats are already scheming with how to get her off with no charges, including Barack Obama and other top officials who were paramount in her walking away scot-free. \nIt seems that no matter how crooked Hillary is, Democrats will always swarm together to protect their evil queen bee. The whole checks-and-balances thing among our branches of government is completely thrown out the window whenever Hillary is involved, as she simply buys the silence of government officials, or if that doesn＊t work, she kills them. It should come as no surprise that the very same people who helped her walk away from her Benghazi scandal, are now flocking once again to save her ass. \nWe＊ve all seen Obama＊s ※Justice§ Department in action over the tenure of his presidency, and it＊s anything but contrived of justice. Now, we＊re seeing even more evidence of their twisted schemes in practice, proving again that everything in Washington, D.C. is completely rigged. \nIn a letter to Congressional leaders, Obama＊s DOJ stated that when it comes to the investigation of over 650,000 emails on Anthony Weiner＊s home computer that they will ※work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible.§ \nWhile that might sound great and wonderful on the surface, most people missed who signed that letter of compliance 〞 Hillary＊s partner in crime, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik. The crooked man not only testified during Benghazi as to Hillary＊s ※innocence,§ but he is also really good friends with Hillary＊s presidential campaign chair, John Podesta. Kadzik and Podesta hung out and dined to celebrate the day after Hillary＊s Benghazi hearings before Congress, and Kadzik was mentioned a whopping 20 times in Podesta＊s emails that were recently released by WikiLeaks. \nHowever, the conniving doesn＊t end there. Rumors are already swirling that if Hillary does get into trouble with this new investigation, that Obama is planning to pardon her, even if it＊s done retroactively after he leaves the White House. \nIn a recent interview, Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Tx) said that win or lose, Barack Obama will simply pardon Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton. ※I think win or lose there＊s a presidential pardon in her future. Historical precedent was set when Ford retroactively pardoned Nixon. I don＊t think that＊s good for our country, but I＊m afraid that＊s going to happen.§ \nEven more infuriating, if Hillary is elected president, she could simply pardon herself. Presidential pardoning powers come from Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution that states that presidents ※have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.§ Basically, as long as she＊s not being impeached, she could pardon herself and walk away completely free. \nOur Founding Fathers were so careful in how they worded our founding documents so that no one in government could ever become too powerful. But how do you plan for someone who encompasses the evil of Hillary Clinton, where she practically owns and controls every single person in Washington, D.C.? If this woman gets elected as the next president, we will soon have a lawless tyrant leading our country.",

    "text": "It＊s Over For Hillary After People See What She Snuck In Her Online Post Posted on November 1, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Hillary Clinton \nSocial media seems to be a tricky tool for Hillary Clinton, as she made a major mistake in what she shared online when she was either inebriated or hopped up on medication to treat what＊s been plaguing her throughout this election. Shocked viewers couldn＊t believe what was seen in her post, which she didn＊t catch until it was way too late. \nAlthough we＊ve seen how good Hillary is at hitting the ※delete§ button, she didn＊t get to it quick enough after what she mindlessly posted that proved what Americans have suspected. Evidently, she didn＊t realize she was making a point against herself when she made the comment with the post that said, ※A guide to help you make your choice for president,§ which mad the mistake all the worse for her. \nEither Hillary takes full responsibility for being corrupt by apparently admitting to it, or the person that does her social media is paying a big price today. Without reading what she was sharing, Hillary blindly posted an article from the super liberal news site, Slate, assuming that if it was from them, it was pro-Hillary, when the title of the piece called her out for being one of the ※most corrupt, least popular candidates of all time.§ A guide to help you make your choice for president. https://t.co/QzK7XZYmJW \n〞 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016 \nUrging her followers in the comment with the post to use it as a guide for making the best presidential pick, it was the best and most honest advice she＊s ever given. It＊s for this reason that the post was likely an accident since we all know that Hillary is incapable of being truthful, but karma, in this case, ensured she was. The irony of the situation isn＊t lost on conservatives but apparently was on Slate, whose piece was actually meant to promote the Democratic candidate but came across as just the opposite. \nThe truth has a sneaky way of coming out as it did in this headline, which calls attention to this woman＊s lack of character and qualifications for the presidency. For once, there＊s finally some common ground conservatives have found within this liberal publication＊s pages, and that＊s that Hillary Clinton is corrupt and incapable of being a leader.",

    "text": "Hillary＊s DONE After Announcing Potential Cabinet Member, Try Not To Vomit Posted on November 1, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This \nWith her numbers tanking, Hillary Clinton is desperate for any vote that she can get. Proving just that, she just floated an idea for a potential cabinet member, but it could actually end her once and for all. \nAt this point, it＊s clear that Hillary isn＊t in control of her own campaign. If she was, she would have buried herself a long time ago. As we continue to get glimpses of her crooked behavior that she tries to keep behind the curtain, it doesn＊t take too much of a genius to know that she doesn＊t really have any good ideas of her own. Hillary Clinton \nProving just that is a potential cabinet member she floated during an interview with Extra . As she didn＊t have her strategists whispering in her ear at the time, telling her when to shut up and when to speak, she actually stated that she would love to have Michelle Obama as a part of her team . \nMichelle Obama is a nobody outside of being married to a president. She＊s been nothing more than a freeloader for the past 8 years who has done literally nothing but make the lives of the American people a living hell. Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama \nDespite Michelle＊s failed legacies and lackadaisical tendencies, Hillary still thought that she would make a great addition to her team. Then again, both Hillary and Michelle have a taste for the finer things in life and enjoy the fruits of everyone else＊s labor. \nWhen directly asked if she would like Michelle in her cabinet, Hillary simply stated : \n※She＊s made it pretty clear she wants to focus on important issues like girls＊ education around the world 每 she and I actually talked about it when we were together in Winston-Salem 每 and I want to be the best partner I can be for whenever she wants to be involved in government again.§ \nHowever, that wasn＊t quite the end of the thought process as she next went against what President Barack Obama said in that Michelle wasn＊t interested in the slightest when it came to furthering herself in the political realm. ※I think she wants to take a break from it, but if she ever wants to do anything like that, I would be the number-one person,§ Hillary said. ※Well, I don＊t know how anybody could have done what she＊s done for the last eight years with more grace and more of a sense of purpose but inclusivity.§ \nHillary＊s sentiments become laughable when she hints to the idea that Michelle actually did anything. Think long and hard about what she did and you＊ll come up with nothing. Her lunch policy only left kids hungry and unsatisfied before failing overall when schools systematically began to reject her mandate. Michelle and Barack Obama \nMaking sure girls are taught everywhere? Well, all we saw was Michelle flying around the globe and taking several vacations while demanding other countries change their ways. Beyond the fact that this does absolutely nothing for the American people (and actually hurts them on account of the cost associated with the several trips), it only ticked people off and made Americans look pretty stupid. \nOf course, this would be a ※smart§ choice for Hillary seeing how blind leftists love and support Michelle for some reason. However, all it really equates to are a few more votes in her pocket as she panders to the audience of someone else. Basically, Hillary is trying to whore Michelle out. I wonder how she feels about that.",

    "text": "Hillary Thugs IDENTIFIED, Homeless Woman Protecting Trump Star Gets Justice Posted on November 1, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in News Share This \nIn a sad story that went viral, thugs beat up a homeless black woman who was defending Donald Trump＊s star on Hollywood Boulevard. Now, those thugs have been identified. Shockingly, these Hillary Clinton thugs are nothing but bullies who beat up anyone supporting Trump, even the elderly and disabled, but the good news is, the homeless black woman is getting much-deserved justice. A black homeless woman was beaten up by Hillary thugs for protecting Donald Trump＊s ※star§& supporting him in this election. \nAfter an idiot took a jackhammer to Donald Trump＊s Hollywood ※Star of Fame,§ one brave black homeless woman decided to protect it from further damage. That brought out the Hillary bullies, but there was one problem. None of them could be identified because   kept the best video evidence from getting out. \nNow, Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars has obtained a clear copy of what happened, and we now have enough evidence to identify the attackers. In the video, Watson does an excellent job of identifying two of the Hillary bullies. One he calls ※ Trigglypuff ,§ an obese woman who may identify as a man, is wanted for felony assault by Los Angeles police, and another man, who ironically is wearing a cross necklace, taunted the homeless woman, saying, ※Didn＊t I tell you about five minutes ago that no I would not defend you because you spewed hate and you got hate, you got exactly what you were dishing out.§ ※Trigglypuff§ (the name given to social justice warriors who get triggered) is caught on video, wanted by police for felony assault. The thug who yelled, ※Didn＊t I tell you,§ is caught on video and also wanted by Los Angeles police for aiding and abetting a felony assault. \nThe California homeless woman sat on the star with a sign that read, ※20 Million Illegals and Americans Sleep in the Streets In Tents, Vote For Trump.§ That was the ※hate§ she was spewing, and here is the backward logic the Hillary bullies are selling, as Watson sarcastically points out , ※Didn＊t I tell you if you disagree if you dare disagree with our retarded political opinions you get physically attacked by a sack of sh*t [Trigglypuff] and by the way it＊s your fault for spewing hate.§ \nAnother thug can be heard saying not to call an ambulance as they continue to laugh at the victim, but there is a silver lining. This latest video gives the police all they need to formally identify ※Trigglypuff,§ who is wanted for felony assault and those other thugs who aided and abetted the felony crime of beating this homeless woman. \nThis incident has gotten so much attention, and the police are very motivated to do everything they can to track down these Hillary bullies. It＊s just a matter of time, and they will be positively identified. In the meantime, Trump dispatched one of his representatives to Los Angeles to find the homeless woman to give her ※something.§ I＊m sure Trump was moved by this woman＊s plight, and what he is offering will help her in the dire situation she finds herself in. \nThis story was not on any mainstream media networks, but imagine if the homeless woman was a Hillary supporter and Trump supporters beat her up. We all know it would be reported on 24/7 on CNN and MSNBC with panels of experts discussing Trump and his supporters who commit acts of violence. \nAs Watson concludes in his video, the only thugs acting out after this election will be the paid Hillary bullies who time after time have shown up at Trump events and used violence against peaceful citizens. Luckily, their sick reign of shame and violence is coming to an end as Hillary is falling apart and Trump will be elected our next president.",

    "text": "Share This \nA Hillary Clinton presidency would devastate our nation, damaging an already unstable economy as she destroys our Constitution and taxes Americans until they bleed. Several businesses are aware of this frightening reality, and they have decided to prepare themselves and others for the worst case scenario 〞 a Hillary presidency. \nSmall businesses are often those affected the most by a Democrat＊s economic policy, but many of America＊s ※mom and pop§ shops are determined to overcome should this terrifying possibility become our reality. Surprisingly, there is a silver lining for some. Certain businesses actually realize that a vote for Hillary and her election as our next president will likely make them extremely wealthy 〞 if only temporarily. Democrat presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton \nGun stores everywhere plan to stock up on guns in preparation for the rigged election, in which most think Hillary has already been decided the winner. Although some are driven by the desire to protect their families, many gun owners are stocking up now before Hillary has a chance to try to take their rights away, which she has vowed to do. Those who have shopped in gun stores even tell the owners that they are gearing up for a Hillary presidency. \nTwo things drive up sales like no ads on TV ever could. The first is election campaigns, which inevitably pit gun-rights advocates against those asking for stricter gun-control laws. And the second, are tragedies in the news, especially mass shootings. Jared Fulton and his son Dave at their gun store, Freedom Firearms \n※If Hillary Clinton gets elected it＊s going to be all hands on deck, and its going to be a crazy day,§ says Jared Fulton, who founded Freedom Firearms with his brother, Joel, in 2002, shortly after Michigan passed a new ※concealed-carry§ law allowing any adult to carry weapons on their person as long as they＊re out of sight. ※It＊s going to be several crazy days, in fact.§ [via Independent ] \nWhile Democrats cry and complain about guns, their antics actually push sales and drive the number of guns in civilian hands exponentially higher. This was seen the day after Barack Obama＊s election and the day of his inauguration. Instead of watching him take the presidential oath, many Second Amendment supporters went out and purchased guns that they knew would offend the new president. And, it won＊t be different if Hillary is elected. \nMake no mistake that while Obama currently holds the record for ※gun salesman of the year,§ every year since he was elected, Hillary will surpass him. Having firepower to back your decision not to consent to her corrupt presidency may be key as she tries to start World War III. Not all Americans are going to willingly accept Hillary＊s rigged and invalid authority. When tyrannical leaders try to take our country from We the People , it＊s our duty to remind them why our Founding Fathers gave us the Second Amendment.",

    "text": "Investigators Horrified At What Was Left Behind In Hillary＊s Hotel Room Posted on November 1, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Hillary Clinton (left), Huma Abedin with Hillary (right) \nHaving gotten away with so much for so long, Hillary Clinton and her inner circle became careless in covering their trail, perhaps because they were confident about not getting caught. However, that＊s all coming back to haunt them as investigators uncovered what Hillary left behind in her hotel room which should disqualify her from the presidential race. \nSince the start of the re-investigation into Hillary＊s emails and supposedly disappearing server, a slew of secrets have trickled out that leaves one to wonder how they were missed in the first place. It＊s recently been discovered what was found in her hotel room on a 2010 trip to Beijing, China, and it could result in dire consequences for our country. \nFox News reported that when then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton traveled to the orient with an unnamed ※senior aide§ six years ago, they brought classified information with them. As prior investigations into her e-mails have proved, tipsy Hillary has a hard time keeping track of highly sensitive documents, and these in China were apparently no different. The unidentified aide, whose job it is to manage these things, left the information unsecured in the hotel room. \n※In May 2010, Secretary Clinton was on official travel in Beijing, China, accompanied by senior staff. Upon Secretary Clinton＊s departure, a routine security sweep by Diplomatic Security agents identified classified documents in a staff member＊s suite,§ State Department spokesman John Kirby told Fox News in a statement. \nConfirmation of this mishandling comes out now as Hillary herself and her longtime senior aide, Huma Abedin, are being investigated for mishandling of sensitive information on a private server that she wasn＊t supposed to have. Although it＊s a matter of national security, Clinton and her crack squad can＊t seem to be trusted with anything of importance that puts our nation in jeopardy. \nFor this reason, Hillary Clinton shouldn＊t even be considered for the White House where she would have full access to nuclear codes. Ironically, she said Donald Trump couldn＊t be trusted with these, yet he＊s not the one with thousands of ※lost§ emails and classified documents left in a hotel room overseas.",

Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, is greeted by Hillary Clinton at a panel discussion at the Clinton Global Initiative, Sept. 24, 2014 in New York. \nPublished in partnership with Shadowproof . \nHe＊s with her. On Sunday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein 〞an endorsement she had been working toward for years. \nAs was revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation. \nOn October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for ※political reasons§ because Congress needed to look like it was doing something about the crisis. She said, ※There＊s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.§ \nYes, she essentially endorsed Wall Street writing the rules because Wall Street knows its business best and complained to Goldman Sachs that regulations had frightened bankers. \n※I mean, right now, there are so many places in our country where the banks are not doing what they need to do because they＊re scared of regulations, they＊re scared of the other shoe dropping, they＊re just plain scared, so credit is not flowing the way it needs to to restart economic growth,§ Clinton said. ※So people are, you know, a little 〞 they＊re still uncertain, and they＊re uncertain both because they don＊t know what might come next in terms of regulations, but they＊re also uncertain because of changes in a global economy that we＊re only beginning to take hold of.§ \nMusic to Wall Street＊s ears. For Goldman Sachs, was there really any other choice this cycle? After all, they did pay Hillary Clinton $675,000 for those three speeches, and have generously supported her political career. \nDespite her private comments to Goldman Sachs, Hillary Clinton has taken a tough public position on Wall Street during the campaign, likely due to Senator Bernie Sanders＊ success in the primaries. Of course, Wikileaks also revealed that Clinton told the National Multi-housing Council in a private speech that ※you need both a public and a private position.§ \nSo the real question is, what do Blankfein and Goldman want in return and what is Clinton＊s private position on giving it to them?

Ms. Walters? \n\nQUESTION: A fter my family, the city of Flint and the children in D.C. were poisoned by lead , will you make a personal promise to me right now that, as president, in your first 100 days in office, you will make it a requirement that all public water systems must remove all lead service lines throughout the entire United States, and notification made to the 〞 the citizens that have said service lines. \nSANDERS: I will make a personal promise to you that the EPA and the EPA director that I appoint will make sure that every water system in the United States of America is tested, and that the people of those communities know the quality of the water that they are drinking, and that we are gonna have a plan to rebuild water systems in this country that are unsafe for drinking. COOPER: Let me just point out for accuracy＊s sake, there is 10 million lead service pipes delivering water to people all across this country tonight. Secretary Clinton? \nCLINTON: Well, I agree completely. I want to go further though. I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because it＊s not only in water systems, it＊s also in soil, and it＊s in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes. That＊s why 500,000 children today have lead 〞 lead in their bodies. \nSo, I want to do exactly what you said. We will commit to a priority to change the water systems, and we will commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere. \nWe were making progress on this in the 1990＊s. I worked with then Senator Obama to get more money, more support to do more to remove lead. \nAnd then there is also this follow-up to a previous email in which Brazile promises even more debate questions. \n\nDonna Brazile was noticeably uncomfortable for every second of the following 10-minute interview with Megyn Kelly of Fox News. Kelly pushed hard on the recent Project Veritas undercover videos showing DNC operatives plotting to incite violence at Trump rallies and commit massive voter fraud and over Brazile＊s leaked email showing that she provided a CNN debate question to Hillary ahead of a March 2016 debate with Bernie. Brazile tried every trick in the book to deflect and pivot but Kelly held her feet to the fire. \nBrazile＊s response on the Project Veritas videos were mostly nonsensical though she did summon the typical democrat argument that O＊Keefe is a criminal and has a history of doctoring videos. But the real fireworks came when she was pressed on her leaked email revealing that she shared a debate question with Hillary in advance of a debate. \n※ I did not receive any questions from CNN , let＊s just be very clear.§ \n※First of all what information are you providing to me that will let me see what you are talking about?§ \n※ As a Christian woman I understand persecution, but I will not sit here and be persecuted because your information is totally false. § \n※Podesta＊s emails were stolen. You＊re like the thief that wants to bring into the night what you found in the gutter. § \n※ I am not going to try to validate falsified information. I have my documents, I have my files. \nBecause Donna seems to be afflicted with the same disease that haunted Hillary during her tenure as Secretary of State, an awful condition the causes the host to ※not recall§ significant life events, below is a refresher of the email in question. \nAnd here is a similar interview by Jordan Chariton of The Young Turks : \nYeah, but Russia. \nThis article originally appeared on ZeroHedge.com .

    "title": "First Thoughts On The Not-Hillary Election Results",
    "text": "November 09, 2016 First Thoughts On The Not-Hillary Election Results \nSo I just woke up and found that the world has changed. World War III was called off. Trump won, Clinton conceded. His victory speech is fair and integrating. \nMy \"not Hillary\" prediction for the election was right. That is, I believe, how Trump won. No so much by gaining genuine votes but by taking them from the crappiest candidate the Democrats could send into the race. This was not a \"white vote\". Trump did better with black (+5) and latino (+2) voters than Romney. Racism does not explain that. Clinton promised more wars. Those who would have to fight them on the ground rejected that position. \nThe people voted against corruption, against international warmongering, against attacks of the culture of their life and against Zionist and Arab manipulation. In short - they voted against Hillary. \nThe media with their outright and widespread manipulation and one sided reporting against Trump and for Clinton lost too. People did not believe the partisan crap that fact-checked Trump on every minor issue but hardly reported on the huge, huge scandals and corruption Wikileaks revealed about the Clintons. Fact-checkers ain't a good weapon in a culture war. The polls, but the one of the LA Times, turned out to be systematic manipulation. \nThe leading politicians in Europe will crap their pants. Nearly all but Putin bet heavily on Clinton. The European media were also strongly pro Clinton, even more so than in the U.S. There was zero reporting about Trump's real political positions and support. Only tiny bits about Clinton's corruption were revealed on the back pages. They always believe what the NYT writes is the essence of U.S. thinking. It is far from it. No one but a few east-coast party goers and the NYT cares about some 16 year old girl, who thinks she is \"transsexual\" and wants to use a men's public toilet. The average people think that such craziness deserves zero attention if not a hefty kick in the ass. Pro-migration and other political correctness movements in Europe will have a difficult stand now. They can no longer work against the instincts of the people by pointing to the soothing, fake words of an Obama or Clinton. \nThe Democratic party failed. The outright corruption of the party heads, who pushed Sanders out to move Clinton in by manipulating the primaries, blocked the natural development that went on at the base. They even wanted Trump as a candidate because they though Clinton could easily beat him. They were totally detached from real life. I am sure that post-mortem analysis will show that many, many potential pro-democratic voters were just disgusted and stayed at home or voted for a third party. The establishment of the Republican party were no better. They failed their voters just as much by shunning Trump and working for Clinton. All the neo-cons that flocked to Clinton will now scramble to get back to Trump. They will have little chance. \nBut the election also created huge new dangers. People around Trump, including his vice-president, are not sane realist but fairly extreme ideologues. Trump himself isn't. He is, in my estimate, fairly pragmatic. The Republicans also won the Senate and House. There is a danger that extreme policies will be implemented with huge and terrible long-term consequences. But remember that Obama had the same chance in his first two years of his Presidency. He never used it. From a progressive view he blew it. \nWinning back the House and Senate in two years is a must for anyone with some middle-of-the-road thinking. \nI believe that this result is good for Syria and the non-Jihadi and non-Zonist Middle East. Al-Qaeda in Syria will have a sad. Their main supporters leave the stage. The result is likely good for Europe including for Russia. It is bad for economic equality in the United States. \nI for one feel mightily eased. The U.S. voters knocked over a chessboard that brought war and misery to many people. We do not know how the new game will look but I think there is a fair chance now that it, in total, will be somewhat less devastating for the global good.

    "title": "Comment on Nomi Prins: Hillary Clinton Will Continue the Big Bank Protection Racket by EndOfTheWorld",
    "text": "by Yves Smith \nYves here. It＊s hardly a secret that the Clintons are deeply loyal to Wall Street. Bob Rubin and his numerous well-heeled followers are a powerful, arguably dominant, faction in the Democratic party, and they are tightly aligned with the Clintons. \nNomi Prins gives a useful overview of how Hillary has attempted to blame the financial crisis on everything but the deregulation that her husband supported and the reckless behavior that resulted and how her anti-bank noises, like her criticism of Wells Fargo, is tepid and late in coming. \nHowever, I quibble with some of her article. It＊s surprising to see her single out Gary Gensler, former head of the CFTC, as a bank crony. Gensler is widely seen as pushing for much tougher oversight and enforcement despite being in the disadvantaged position of being at a secondary regulator. Recall that he was up against Bernanke and Geithner, a weak Mary Shapiro at the SEC, and an indifferent-to-captured Obama at the helm. \nIt＊s also surprising to see Prins fail to mention the cronies rumored to be Clinton＊s top picks for Treasury Secretary: Larry Fink of BlackRock and Tony James of Blackstone. Both firms would profit ginormously if the Wall Street looting plan that Hillary supports and James is promoting, that of having all workers pay 3% of their pay into mandatory retirement accounts, were to become law. \nAs we＊ve indicated, the cost of this ※fix§ is greater than any of the ideas proposed to shore up Social Security (as opposed to cut it by stealth). I hate to say it, but I believe Prins＊ failure to flag this risk is due to her still hewing to orthodox financial views and thus believing that Federal deficits are a problem, as opposed to desirable, most of the time, and regarding senior members of the asset management heavyweights as less dangerous than executives of TBTF banks. Since even the modest re-regulation that has taken place since the crisis has increased shadow banking, and firms like Blackrock and Blackstone are major players, it would be naive to depict them as problem-free and disinterested. \nBy Nomi Prins, a former Wall Street executive and the author of six books of which the most recent is All the Presidents＊ Bankers: The Hidden Alliances That Drive American Power (Nation Books). Originally published at TomDispatch \nAs this endless election limps toward its last days, while spiraling into a bizarre duel over vote-rigging accusations, a deep sigh is undoubtedly in order. The entire process has been an emotionally draining, frustration-inducing, rage-inflaming spectacle of repellent form over shallow substance. For many, the third debate evoked fatigue. More worrying, there was again no discussion of how to prevent another financial crisis, an ominous possibility in the next presidency, whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton enters the Oval Office 〞 given that nothing fundamental has been altered when it comes to Wall Street＊s practices and predation. \nAt the heart of American political consciousness right now lies a soul-crushing reality for millions of distraught Americans: the choices for president couldn＊t be feebler or more disappointing. On the one hand, we have a petulant, vocabulary-challenged man-boar of a billionaire, who hasn＊t paid his taxes, has regularly left those supporting him holding the bag , and seems like a ludicrous composite of every bad trait in every bad date any woman has ever had. On the other hand, we＊re offered a walking photo-op for and well-paid speechmaker to Wall-Street CEOs, a one-woman money-raising machine from the 1% of the 1%, who, despite a folksiness that couldn＊t look more rehearsed, has methodically outplayed her opponent. \nWith less than two weeks to go before E-day 〞 despite the Trumptilian upheaval of the last year 〞 the high probability of a Clinton win means the establishment remains intact. When we awaken on November 9th, it will undoubtedly be dawn in Hillary Clinton＊s America and that potentially means four years of an economic dystopia that will (as would Donald Trump＊s version of the same) leave many Americans rightfully anxious about their economic futures. \nNone of the three presidential debates suggested that either candidate would have the ability (or desire) to confront Wall Street from the Oval Office. In the second and third debates, in case you missed them, Hillary didn＊t even mention the Glass-Steagall Act, too big to fail, or Wall Street. While in the first debate, the subject of Wall Street only came up after she disparaged the tax policies of ※ Trumped-up, trickle down economics § (or, as I like to call it, the Trumpledown economics of giving tax and financial benefits to the rich and to corporations). \nIn this election, Hillary has crafted her talking points regarding the causes of the last financial crisis as weapons against Trump, but they hardly begin to tell the real story of what happened to the American economy. The meltdown of 2007-2008 was not mainly due to ※tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy§ or a ※failure to invest in the middle class,§ two subjects she has repeatedly highlighted to slam the Republicans and their candidate. It was a byproduct of the destruction of the regulations that opened the way for a too-big-to-fail framework to thrive. Under the presidency of Bill Clinton, Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era act that once separated people＊s bank deposits and loans from any kind of risky bets or other similar actions in which banks might engage, was repealed under the Financial Modernization Act of 1999. In addition, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was passed, which allowed Wall Street to concoct devastating unregulated side bets on what became the subprime crisis. \nGiven that the people involved with those choices are still around and some are still advising (or in the case of one former president living with) Hillary Clinton, it＊s reasonable to imagine that, in January 2017, she＊ll launch the third term of Bill Clinton when it comes to financial policy, banks, and the economy. Only now, the stakes are even higher, the banks larger, and their impunity still remarkably unchallenged. \nConsider President Obama＊s current treasury secretary, Jack Lew. It was Hillary who hit the Clinton Rolodex to bring him back to Washington. Lew first entered Bill Clinton＊s White House in 1993 as special assistant to the president. Between his stints working for Clinton and Obama, he made his way into the private sector and eventually to Wall Street 〞 as so many of his predecessors had done and successors would do. He scored a leadership role with Citigroup during the time that Bill Clinton＊s former Treasury Secretary (and former Goldman Sachs co-Chairman ) Robert Rubin was on its board of directors. In 2009 , Hillary selected him to be her deputy secretary of state. \nLew is hardly the only example of the busy revolving door to power that led from the Clinton administration to the Obama administration via Wall Street (or activities connected to it). Bill Clinton＊s Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs , Timothy Geithner worked with Robert Rubin, later championed Wall Street as president and CEO of the New York Federal Reserve while Hillary was senator from New York (representing Wall Street), and then became Obama＊s first treasury secretary while Hillary was secretary of state . \nOne possible contender for treasury secretary in a new Clinton administration would be Bill Clinton＊s Under Secretary of Domestic Finance and Obama＊s Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, Gary Gensler (who was 〞 I＊m sure you won＊t be shocked 〞 a Goldman Sachs partner before entering public service). These, then, are typical inhabitants of the Clinton inner circle and of the political-financial corridors of power. Their thinking, like Hillary＊s, meshes well with support for the status quo in the banking system, even if, like her, they are willing on occasion to admonish it for its ※mistakes.§ \nThis thru-line of personnel in and out of Clinton World is dangerous for most of the rest of us, because behind all the ※talking heads§ and genuinely amusing Saturday Night Live skits about this bizarre election lie certain crucial issues that will have to be dealt with: decisions about climate change, foreign wars, student-loan unaffordability, rising income inequality , declining social mobility , and, yes, the threat of another financial crisis. And keep in mind that such a future economic meltdown isn＊t an absurdly long-shot possibility. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve, the nation＊s main bank regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , the government entity that insures our bank deposits, collectively noted that seven of our biggest eight banks 〞 Citigroup was the exception 〞 still have inadequate emergency plans in the event of another financial crisis. \nExploring a Two-Faced World \nPoliticians regularly act one way publicly and another privately, as Hillary was ※outed§ for doing by WikiLeaks via its document dump from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta＊s hacked email account. Such realities should be treated as neither shockers nor smoking guns. Everybody postures. Everybody lies. Everybody＊s two-faced in certain aspects of their lives. Politicians just make a career out of it. \nWhat＊s problematic about Hillary＊s public and private positions in the economic sphere, at least, isn＊t their two-facedness but how of a piece they are. Yes, she warned the bankers to ※ cut it out ! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors!§〞 but that was no demonstration of strength in relation to the big banks. Her comments revealed no real understanding of their precise role in exacerbating a fixable subprime loan calamity and global financial crisis, nor did her finger-wagging mean anything to Wall Street. \nKeep in mind that, during the build-up to that crisis, as banks took advantage of looser regulations, she collected more than $7 million from the securities and investment industry for her New York Senate runs ( $18 million during her career). In her first Senate campaign, Citigroup was her top contributor. The four Wall-Street-based banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) all feature among her top 10 career contributors. As a senator, she didn＊t introduce any bills aimed at reforming or regulating Wall Street. During the lead-up to the financial crisis of 2007-2008, she did introduce five (out of 140) bills relating to the housing crisis, but they all died before making it through a Senate committee. So did a bill she sponsored to curtail corporate executive compensation. Though she has publicly called for a reduction in hedge-fund tax breaks (known as ※closing the carried interest loophole§), including at the second debate , she never signed on to the bill that would have done so (one that Obama co-sponsored in 2007). Perhaps her most important gesture of support for Wall Street was her vote in favor of the $700 billion 2008 bank bailout bill. (Bernie Sanders opposed it.) \nAfter her secretary of state stint, she returned to the scene of banking crimes. Many times. As we know, she was also paid exceedingly well for it. Friendship with the Clintons doesn＊t come cheap . As she said in October 2013, while speaking at a Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments＊ Symposium, ※running for office in our country takes a lot of money, and candidates have to go out and raise it. New York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle.§ \nBetween 2013 and 2015, she gave 12 speeches to Wall Street banks, private equity firms, and other financial corporations, reaping a whopping $2,935,000 for them. In her 2016 presidential run, the securities and investment sector (aka Wall Street) has contributed the most of any industry to PACs supporting Hillary: $56.4 million . \nYes, everybody needs to make a buck or a few million of them. This is America after all, but Hillary was a political figure paid by the same banks routinely getting slapped with criminal settlements by the Department of Justice. In addition, the Clinton Foundation counted as generous donors all four of the major Wall Street-based mega-banks. She was voracious when it came to such money and tone-deaf when it came to the irony of it all. \nGlass-Steagall and Bernie Sanders \nOne of the more illuminating aspects of the Podesta emails was a series of communications that took place in the fall of 2015. That＊s when Bernie Sanders was gaining traction for, among other things, his calls to break up the big banks and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. The Clinton administration＊s dismantling of that act in 1999 had freed the big banks to use their depositors＊ money as collateral for risky bets in the real estate market and elsewhere, and so allowed them to become ever more engorged with questionable securities. \nOn December 7, 2015, with her campaign well underway and worried about the Sanders challenge, the Clinton camp debuted a key Hillary op-ed , ※How I＊d Rein in Wall Street,§ in the New York Times . This followed two months of emails and internal debate within her campaign over whether supporting the return of Glass-Steagall was politically palatable for her and whether not supporting it would antagonize Senator Elizabeth Warren. In the end, though Glass-Steagall was mentioned in passing in her op-ed, she chose not to endorse its return. \nShe explained her decision not to do so this way (and her advisers and media apostles have stuck with this explanation ever since): ※Some have urged the return of a Depression-era rule called Glass-Steagall , which separated traditional banking from investment banking. But many of the firms that contributed to the crash in 2008, like A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers, weren＊t traditional banks, so Glass-Steagall wouldn＊t have limited their reckless behavior. Nor would restoring Glass-Steagall help contain other parts of the ＆shadow banking＊ sector, including certain activities of hedge funds, investment banks, and other non-bank institutions.§ \nHer entire characterization of how the 2007-2008 banking crisis unfolded was 〞 well 〞 wrong. Here＊s how traditional banks (like JPMorgan Chase) operated: they lent money to investment banks like Lehman Brothers so that they could buy more financial waste products stuffed with subprime mortgages that these traditional banks were, in turn, trying to sell. They then backed up those toxic financial products through insurance companies like AIG, which came close to collapse when what it was insuring became too toxically overwhelming to afford. AIG then got a $182 billion government bailout that also had the effect of bailing out those traditional banks (including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which became ※traditional§ during the crisis). In this way, the whole vicious cycle started with the traditional banks that hold your deposits and at the same time could produce and sell those waste products thanks to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. So yes, the loss of that act caused the crisis and, in its wake, every big traditional bank was fined for crisis-related crimes. \nHillary won＊t push to bring back Glass-Steagall. Doing so would dismantle her husband＊s legacy and that of the men he and she appointed to public office. Whatever cosmetic alterations may be in store, count on that act remaining an artifact of the past, since its resurrection would dismay the bankers who, over the past three decades, made the Clintons what they are. \nNo wonder many diehard Sanders supporters remain disillusioned and skeptical 〞 not to speak of the fact that their candidate featured dead last ( 39th ) on a list of recommended vice presidential candidates in the Podesta emails. That＊s unfortunately how much his agenda is likely to matter to her in the Oval Office. \nGo Regulate Yourselves! \nBefore he resigned with his nine-figure golden parachute, Wells Fargo CEO and Chairman John Stumpf addressed Congress over disclosures that 5,300 of his employees had created two million fake accounts, scamming $2.4 million from existing customers. The bank was fined $ 185 million for that (out of a total $10 billion in fines for a range of other crimes committed before and during the financial crisis). \nIn response, Hillary wrote a letter to Wells Fargo＊s customers. In it, she didn＊t actually mention Stumpf by name, as she has not mentioned any Wall Street CEO by name in the context of criminal activity. Instead, she simply spoke of ※he.§ As she put it, ※He owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch.§ She added, ※Executives should be held individually accountable when rampant illegal activity happens on their watch.§ \nShe does have a plan to fine banks for being too big, but they＊ve already been fined repeatedly for being crooked and it hasn＊t made them any smaller or less threatening. As their top officials evidently view the matter, paying up for breaking the law is just another cost of doing business. \nHillary also wrote, ※If any bank can＊t be managed effectively, it should be broken up.§ But the question is: Why doesn＊t ongoing criminal activity that threatens the rest of us correlate with ineffective management 〞 or put another way, when was the last time you saw a major bank broken up? And don＊t hold your breath for that to happen in a new Clinton administration either. \nIn her public letter, she added , ※I＊ll appoint regulators who will stand with taxpayers and consumers, not with big banks and their friends in Congress.§ On the other hand, at that same Goldman Sachs symposium , while in fundraising mode, she gave bankers a pass relative to regulators and commented: ※Well, I represented all of you for eight years. I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown, and [I have] a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it.§ \nShe has steadfastly worked to craft explanations for the financial crisis and the Great Recession that don＊t endanger the banks as we presently know them. In addition, she has supported the idea of appointing insider regulators, insisting that ※the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.§ (Let＊s not forget that former Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Hank Paulson ran the Treasury Department while the crisis brewed.) \nAmong the emails sent to John Podesta that were posted by WikiLeaks is an article I wrote for TomDispatch on the Clintons＊ relationships with bankers. ※She will not point fingers at her friends,§ I said in that piece in May 2015. She will not chastise the people who pay her hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop to speak or the ones who have long shared the social circles in which she and her husband move.§ I also suggested that she wouldn＊t call out any CEO by name. To this day she hasn＊t. I said that she would never be an advocate for Glass-Steagall. And she hasn＊t been. What was true then will be no less true once she＊s in the White House and no longer has to make gestures toward the platform on which Bernie ran and so can once again more openly embrace the bankers＊ way of conducting business. \nThere＊s a reason Wall Street has a crush on her and its monarchs like Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Lloyd Blankfein pay her such stunning sums to offer anodyne remarks to their employees and others. Blankfein has been coy about an official Clinton endorsement simply because he doesn＊t want to rock her campaign boat, but make no mistake, this Wall Street kingpin＊s silence is tantamount to an endorsement. \nTo date, $10 trillion worth of assets sits on the books of the Big Six banks. Since 2008, these same banks have copped to more than $ 150 billion in fines for pre-crisis behavior that ranged on the spectrum of criminality from manipulating multiple public markets to outright fraud. Hillary Clinton has arguably taken money that would not have been so available if it weren＊t for the ill-gotten gains those banks secured. In her usual measured way, albeit with some light admonishments, she has told them what they want to hear: that if they behave 〞 something that in her dictionary of definitions involves little in the way of personalized pain or punishment 〞 so will she. \nSo let＊s recap Hillary＊s America, past, present, and future. It＊s a land lacking in meaningful structural reform of the financial system, a place where the big banks have been, and will continue to be, coddled by the government. No CEO will be jailed, no matter how large the fines his bank is saddled with or how widespread the crimes it committed. Instead, he＊s likely to be invited to the inaugural ball in January. Because its practices have not been adequately controlled or curtailed, the inherent risk that Wall Street poses for Main Street will only grow as bankers continue to use our money to make their bets. (The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act was supposed to help on this score, but has yet to make the big banks any smaller.) \nAnd here＊s an obvious corollary to all this: the next bank-instigated economic catastrophe will not be dealt with until it has once again crushed the financial stability of millions of Americans. \nThe banks have voted with their dollars on all of this in multiple ways. Hillary won＊t do anything to upset that applecart. We should have no illusions about what her presidency would mean from a Wall Street vs. Main Street perspective. Certainly, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn＊t. He effectively endorsed Hillary before a crowd of financial industry players, saying , ※I hope the next president, she reaches across the aisle.§ \nFor Wall Street, of course, that aisle is essentially illusory, since its players operate so easily and effectively on both sides of it. In Hillary＊s America, Wall Street will still own Main Street. 0 0 0 0 0 0",

    "title": "George Soros on tape: Trump will win popular vote in 'landslide,' but Hillary Clinton's electoral victory is already 'a done deal'",
    "text": "Even Republican politicians and former politicians are telling Trump to knock off such talk .But, as usual, Trump's shrewdness and defiance of standard political decorum 每 in which the \"opposition\" party merely rolls over and surrenders in the face of Democratic pressure 每 is winning the day.None other than billionaire investor and longtime Democratic supporter George Soros has said that the fix is literally in for the election, in favor of Clinton 每 no matter how much of the popular vote, and from which battleground states, Trump captures.As reported by Top Right News and other outlets, during a recent interview with Bloomberg News , Soros 每 a Democrat mega-donor 每 openly admitted that Trump will win the popular vote in a \"landslide.\"However, he said that none of that would matter, because a President Hillary Clinton is already a \"done deal.\"In the interview, which is now going viral, Soros says with certainty that Trump will take the popular vote, despite what the polls say now (which are completely rigged to oversample Democrats ), but not the Electoral College, which will go to Clinton.When the reporter asks if that is already a \"done deal\" 每 that Clinton will be our next president no matter what 每 Soros says \"yes,\" and nods his head.Is Soros just making a prediction out of overconfidence? Or does he truly know something most of us don't know?In a recent column , Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, says that Soros and Democrats have \"bribed electoral college representatives\" in a bid to \"fix\" the election outcome in favor of Clinton. In truth, that would be the only way it could be done, short of massive voter fraud through electronic balloting, as some reports have already claimed .Adams further pointed out that Soros was one of the main money men behind the Black Lives Matter movement, which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country 每 some of which has led to the deaths of several officers already.Soros also funds left-wing websites and groups that locate, pay and deploy volunteer \"agitators\" at Trump rallies, to start fights and engage in physical violence against Trump supporters (acts that the establishment media then blames on Trump ).But aren't electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that elector's district? No, they're not. Nine-nine percent of electors have done what they're supposed to do throughout our history, but this is no ordinary election Per Archives.gov , there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote. Rather, these pledges fall into two categories: State law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political parties.In the past, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution doesn't require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please and, therefore, respective political parties may \"extract pledges from electors to vote for the parties' nominees,\" Archives.gov notes. Some state laws hold that \"faithless electors\" could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid ballot, and could then be replaced by a substitute elector.\"The Supreme Court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the Constitution. No Elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged,\" said Archives.gov.The site notes that throughout our history, 99 percent of electors have voted as required. But this is no ordinary time, and it's no ordinary election . And Democrats (and the establishment media) have already proven that they will do anything to stop a Trump presidency. Plus, establishment Republicans don't want Trump either, so you can bet they wouldn't balk at or challenge the buying off of electors. Sources:",

    "text": "Dilbert creator Scott Adams endorses Trump, says Hillary is a bully \nMonday, October 31, 2016 by: Natural News Editors (NaturalNews) I've been trying to figure out what common trait binds Clinton supporters together. As far as I can tell, the most unifying characteristic is a willingness to bully in all its forms.If you have a Trump sign in your lawn, they will steal it.If you have a Trump bumper sticker, they will deface your car.if you speak of Trump at work you could get fired.(Article republished from Dilbert.com )On social media, almost every message I get from a Clinton supporter is a bullying type of message. They insult. They try to shame. They label. And obviously they threaten my livelihood.We know from Project Veritas that Clinton supporters tried to incite violence at Trump rallies. The media downplays it.We also know Clinton's side hired paid trolls to bully online. You don't hear much about that.Yesterday, by no coincidence, Huffington Post, Salon, and Daily Kos all published similar-sounding hit pieces on me, presumably to lower my influence. (That reason, plus jealousy, are the only reasons writers write about other writers.)Joe Biden said he wanted to take Trump behind the bleachers and beat him up. No one on Clinton's side disavowed that call to violence because, I assume, they consider it justified hyperbole.Team Clinton has succeeded in perpetuating one of the greatest evils I have seen in my lifetime. Her side has branded Trump supporters (40%+ of voters) as Nazis, sexists, homophobes, racists, and a few other fighting words. Their argument is built on confirmation bias and persuasion. But facts don't matter because facts never matter in politics. What matters is that Clinton's framing of Trump provides moral cover for any bullying behavior online or in person. No one can be a bad person for opposing Hitler, right?Some Trump supporters online have suggested that people who intend to vote for Trump should wear their Trump hats on election day. That is a dangerous idea, and I strongly discourage it. There would be riots in the streets because we already know the bullies would attack. But on election day, inviting those attacks is an extra-dangerous idea. Violence is bad on any day, but on election day, Republicans are far more likely to unholster in an effort to protect their voting rights. Things will get wet fast.Yes, yes, I realize Trump supporters say bad things about Clinton supporters too. I don't defend the bad apples on either side. I'll just point out that Trump's message is about uniting all Americans under one flag. The Clinton message is that some Americans are good people and the other 40% are some form of deplorables, deserving of shame, vandalism, punishing taxation, and violence. She has literally turned Americans on each other. It is hard for me to imagine a worse thing for a presidential candidate to do.I'll say that again.As far as I can tell, the worst thing a presidential candidate can do is turn Americans against each other. Clinton is doing that, intentionally. Intentionally. As I often say, I don't know who has the best policies. I don't know the best way to fight ISIS and I don't know how to fix healthcare or trade deals. I don't know which tax policies are best to lift the economy. I don't know the best way to handle any of that stuff. (And neither do you.) But I do have a bad reaction to bullies. And I've reached my limit.I hope you have too. Therefore... I endorse Donald Trump for President of the United States because I oppose bullying in all its forms. I don't defend Trump's personal life. Neither Trump nor Clinton are role models for our children. Let's call that a tie, at worst.The bullies are welcome to drown in their own bile while those of us who want a better world do what we've been doing for hundreds of years: Work to make it better while others complain about how we're doing it.Today I put Trump's odds of winning in a landslide back to 98%. Remember, I told you a few weeks ago that Trump couldn't win unless \"something changed.\"Something just changed.",

    "text": "Clinton operative 'Dirty' Donna Brazile is the kind of political filth we need to eradicate from Washington DC: She let Hillary Clinton CHEAT at the debates! \nTuesday, November 01, 2016 Tags: Donna Brazile , cheating democrats , racketeering (NaturalNews) Dirty Donna Brazile. Political filth on display. The stench of dirty democrat tactics has now reached a new, nauseating milestone in America with the revelation that \"Dirty\" Donna Brazile, a DNC operative working for Clinton, smuggled debate questions out of CNN and handed them over to the Clinton camp before the debates ever took place so that Hillary Clinton could CHEAT.Yes, Hillary Clinton CHEATED in the debates. As I've said all along, they were 100% rigged by CNN, the \"Clinton News Network,\" which now functions as the propaganda front of the criminal Clinton cartel seeking to steal power by crushing the very concept of open, fair and free elections in America.\"CNN commentator Donna Brazile, who is now the chair of the Democratic National Committee, [was] caught again passing debate questions from the network to the Clinton campaign during the Democratic primary,\" reports Breitbart.com .Dirty Donna Brazile was caught so blatantly that even CNN had to fire her to create the appearance that CNN is still engaged in something resembling ethical journalism. Funneling town hall and debate questions to Hillary Clinton days before the events... The Daily Caller adds even more stunning revelations to the depths of cheating carried out by Dirty Donna Brazile on behalf of the corrupt, criminal-minded Clintons: Donna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, began providing town hall and debate questions to the Clinton campaign earlier than previously known, emails released by WikiLeaks on Monday show.The email threads also show that Brazile, a former CNN contributor, revealed to the Clinton campaign the name of the person who provided her with a question that was asked of Clinton at a March 13 town hall co-hosted by CNN and TV One. Brazile also shared a question from a debate hosted by CNN a week earlier.A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN's Jake Tapper.A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich. ARREST Brazile, Mills, Podesta, Schultz, Abedin and Clinton What we are all witnessing here with these revelations about cheating, corruption, obstruction of justice, bribery and vote fraud is nothing less than the inner workings of a criminal cartel composed of a modern day political mafia .All these political scumbags need to go to jail. They are all guilty of serious crimes against the United States and against democracy itself. They respect no law. They follow no rules. They cheat, lie, deceive, steal and intimidate their way to power, election after election. They live as legally immune parasites feeding off the blood, sweat and tears of the American middle class who are barely staying afloat while Washington elitists like Brazile, Abedin and Clinton dine on luxury meals like a disturbing scene out of the Hunger Games .But it's not President Snow we have to worry about in the real world... it's the haunting possibility of a President Clinton. Why We the People must NEVER allow Hillary Clinton to seize the White House We the People must never allow Hillary Clinton to seize the White House. We must halt this sociopathic liar and cheater at the ballot box on November 8th. And once that's accomplished, we must petition President Trump to relentlessly pursue criminal indictments of the HUNDREDS of seditious traitors inside the Clinton regime who have blatantly violated numerous federal laws to commit massive fraud and attempted theft of power across America.There are literally hundreds of these democrat criminals who need to be locked up for life. They are a danger to democracy and a danger to a free society. They are sociopaths, liars, cheats and even murderers. They are fraudsters and political con artists who prey upon the weak-minded (i.e. democrats who are still so stupid and clueless that they're voting for Hillary ). If we don't stop them now, they threaten to turn America into a Fourth Reich , complete with the mass murder of political dissidents and the silencing of all critics of the Clinton regime.These democrats like Dirty Donna Brazile want to run America like Haiti , complete with all the corruption, bribery, scandals and economic collapse that Third World countries routinely suffer.But filthy scumbags like Brazile are about to find out something rather shocking: We the People won't tolerate your lies and corruption any longer! We the People are going to arrest you, indict you, prosecute you and see you and your co-conspirators behind bars where you belong. The Trump movement is awakening tens of millions of Americans to the astonishing criminality of the democrats in Washington There's an unstoppable movement rising up in America now that simply will not tolerate filthy democrats stealing our democracy and conning their way into power. If they steal the election, we will take to the streets and declare a Clinton presidency illegitimate and illegal . We will stand behind the military men and women in uniform as the U.S. armed forces depose you and remove you from office , to announce new elections without the festering, cancerous stench of the DNC and the Clintons hanging over this nation like a putrid cloud of filth.We the People have had enough of you demons, you creatures from Hell, you walking bags of anti-human reptilian snakes who pretend to be \"leaders\" in Washington. Your days of tyranny and totalitarian domination are rapidly coming to an end. And you will soon face the informed justice of an enraged population that refuses to be enslaved by your incessant corruption and wretched government rackets.From Breitbart.com : Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton's abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a \"racketeering enterprise,\" which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained:Under RICO, an \"enterprise\" can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate ? it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through \"a pattern of racketeering activity.\" A \"pattern\" means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute \"racketeering activity\" if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute. It's time to defeat Clinton , followed by arresting all the Clinton operatives and initiating hundreds of federal prosecution cases against these Third World fraudsters. That's how we take back America, restore democracy and regain public trust in law and order. NOTE TO THE FEDS: Arrest the democrat criminals or lose any semblance of legal authority in America REMEMBER: If federal authorities do not arrest and prosecute the Clintons and all their co-conspirators, they essentially forfeit any real claim to legitimate legal authority. At that point, the citizens will realize they no longer have any logical obligation to pay federal taxes, obey federal laws, abide by federal regulations or consent to be governed by anybody in Washington at all.After all, a nation run by a system that refuses to hold its leaders accountable for their criminal conduct is a nation that can no longer claim to operate under the rule of law. At that point, \"justice\" becomes a sad, tragic joke against the citizens, and the nation soon finds itself on the verge of a mass citizens' revolt. If the FBI won't seek criminal indictments against Hillary Clinton and her criminal cohorts, sooner or later the military or the citizens will do it for them .

    "text": "Share on Facebook \nRepublican Donald Trump has never been good at controlling his anger, and the same goes for his insane jealousy. \nLast night, Jay Z and Beyonce shared the stage with Hillary Clinton at a concert in Cleveland, Ohio. The A-list couple showed Clinton a stunning amount of support, followed by a powerful speech by the Democratic candidate herself. It was a monumental moment, and Trump hated every second of it. \nAt a rally of his own, Trump couldn＊t hide the fact that he was green with envy. Trump said: \n※We＊re going to do it, folks. We＊re going to do it. Oh boy, are we going to win Pennsylvania big. Look at this. I hear we set a new record for this building. And by the way, I didn＊t have to bring J Lo or Jay Z, the only way she gets anybody. I＊m here all by myself. I am here all by myself. Just me. No guitar, no piano, no nothing.§ \nTrump didn＊t even try to hide how sorry he felt for himself, and it was obvious that he was trying really hard not to completely lose it over the fact that no one likes him and almost no celebrities want to be affiliated with him. You can watch Trump give his pathetic, desperate speech below: \nTrump＊s bullsh*t campaign is finally coming to an end. He spent the beginning of his campaign promising America that he＊d run a star-studded campaign, and he has almost nothing to show for it almost a year later. Not even his own Republican colleagues wanted to appear with him on the campaign trail, forcing Trump to go it alone. \nOf course Trump is jealous and bitter. While Clinton doesn＊t need the support of the massive amount of celebrities who have endorsed her, their support is a clear sign that she is doing something right and her campaign is something worth standing by. You can watch Beyonce and Jay Z stand with Clinton below: \nFeatured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images Patti Colli My passion is bringing attention to human rights and equality issues.

    "text": "Share on Facebook \nOn Tuesday, researchers announced that there＊s enough evidence of hacking or foul play to ask for an audit of three state＊s voting tabulations: Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Donald Trump won those three states by a narrow margin and without them, he would have lost. \nThere＊s a movement to ask the Justice Department to demand the audits, but they might not have to. Help is coming from a surprising source, the Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. She＊s calling for a recount in those three states and we can help her get one. \n※After a divisive and painful presidential race,§ the Green Party candidate said in a statement, ※reported hacks into voter and party databases and individual email accounts are causing many Americans to wonder if our election results are reliable.§ It's official: Jill Stein announces plans to file for a recount in PA, MI & WI. From her release: pic.twitter.com/Yh0gcVBPOR \n〞 Alexandra Jaffe (@ajjaffe) November 23, 2016 \nStein may have a case: \nLast Thursday, the activists held a conference call with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign general counsel Marc Elias to make their case, according to a source briefed on the call. The academics presented findings showing that in Wisconsin, Clinton received 7 percent fewer votes in counties that relied on electronic-voting machines compared with counties that used optical scanners and paper ballots. Based on this statistical analysis, Clinton may have been denied as many as 30,000 votes; she lost Wisconsin by 27,000. While it＊s important to note the group has not found proof of hacking or manipulation, they are arguing to the campaign that the suspicious pattern merits an independent review 〞 especially in light of the fact that the Obama White House has accused the Russian government of hacking the Democratic National Committee. \nSource: NY Magazine \nThe math would still be tight. Michigan＊s count still isn＊t complete, but it＊s likely that their 16 electoral votes would add to Trump＊s 290. If those three states were suddenly to suddenly turn blue (Trump won the three states with a combined vote difference of just over 100,000), Trump would have 260 electoral votes and Clinton would have a total of 278 electoral votes. 270 are needed to win. \nStein wouldn＊t end up winning the election, no matter what. It＊s hard to imagine what her motive would be, other than transparency and regardless of how you feel about her, that＊s laudable. \nWhat she＊s lacking so far is money. She needs to raise $2 million by Friday at 4:00 PM Central Time. So far, she＊s raised less than 10 percent of that. \nDoing something like this may have its downsides, although not too far down. The confidence in the Electoral College is already eroding. There＊s no reason at all that three midwestern states should prevent the clear popular winner from becoming President. The biggest risk is that disgruntled Trump supporters could lash out, but they are lashing out as winners, so let＊s not let that stop us from taking the time to ensure that our democracy stays intact.",

The Presidential hopeful seems determined to make a series of unprovoked errors, not least of which was agreeing to Bill hosting a sleepover for a group of Girl Guides. \nShort of dressing the Statue of Liberty in a Burka, Mrs Clinton has lurched from one PR blunder to another. Commented one journalist: ＆The Presidential race is entering the final furlong and if Mrs Clinton was horse 每 and before you can say Benghazi 每 she＊s gone from bookie＊s favourite to an ingredient at the local glue factory＊. \nHaving already become the unwitting focus of various health scares and FBI investigations, Mrs Clinton＊s campaign is as orderly as a Marx Brothers movie. \nHer lead in the polls has been cut as video emerges of her lighting a cigar with a rolled up Bill of Rights, then proceeding to take a dump on the White House lawn. \nHillary＊s erratic behaviour has seen her sing the Star-Spangled Banner in Korean, dress as Oprah Winfrey for Halloween and pebble-dash Mount Rushmore.

Beth Moore, well-known false teacher and false New Age prophet, has decided that this is the person we need in the White House. by Geoffrey Grider October 27, 2016 False teacher Beth Moore is breaking away from fellow evangelical leaders/speakers who stand with Donald Trump, and throwing her weight behind a woman who is aggressively in favor of later term abortion \n※The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?§ Jeremiah 5:31 (KJV) \nEDITOR＊S NOTE: One of the main planks in Crooked Hillary＊s platform is her very aggressive support in favor of late term, partial-birth abortion up to nearly the very last day of the due date. Beth Moore, well-known false teacher and false New Age prophet, has decided that this is the person we need in the White House. Let that sink in for a moment. By supporting HIllary Clinton Beth Moore will be working to increase, fund, guarantee and protect abortion in America. Hillary Clinton OK With Abortion Day Before Birth: \nBeth Moore suggested that Trump＊s words from 11 years ago highlight how men are ※objectifying§ women today, and she made clear that she will not support Trump over it. She issued a number of tweets on the topic, not one of which criticized Hillary Clinton for the way she has treated the women who allege Bill Clinton sexually assaulted them 〞 women like Paula Jones and Juanita Broaddrick, the latter of whom recently recounted the way Bill Clinton allegedly raped her. False teachers Beth Moore and Joyce Meyer promoting unbiblical unity: \nThe Daily Mail reported that ※Jones reached an out of court settlement§ in a suit wherein she alleged that Bill, while Governor of Arkansas, dropped his pants and asked her ※ to kiss it .§ Beth Moore False Vision: \nWhat does a false teacher and false prophet sound like? It sounds exactly like this＃. \nTrump stood up for these women , holding a press conference with them on Sunday as a way of breaking through the mainstream media＊s refusal to report on Bill＊s sexual history and Hillary＊s efforts to undermine that history. Heretofore, Hillary＊s canned response to Bill＊s accusers has been to go after the women. In fact, she has gone after the women with such fervor that the Washington Post recently asked if Hillary was Bill＊s ※enabler§? Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump spar over partial-birth abortion during third debate: \nThe Post reported : \n＃ Hillary Clinton dismissed an accusation made by Gennifer Flowers, the singer who sold her story to a supermarket tabloid after having previously denied an affair. In an ABC News interview, she called Flowers ※some failed cabaret singer who doesn＊t even have much of a r谷sum谷 to fall back on.§ She told Esquire magazine in 1992 that if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, ※I mean, I would crucify her.§ \nTrump brought a small number of women from Bill＊s past to the October 9 presidential debate, where he pointed out that they should be honored for standing up, rather than humiliated. Politico published the transcript of Trump looking at Bill＊s accusers, then saying: \nHillary Clinton attacked those same women, and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight ＃ So don＊t tell me about words. I am, absolutely, I apologize for those words, but it is things that people say, but what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law, he had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones who is also here tonight. And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it＊s disgraceful and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth. \nYet Christian speaker Beth Beth Moore focused her attention on Trump. In an October 9 tweet, Moore said , ※I＊m one among many women sexually abused, misused, stared down, heckled, talked naughty to. Like we liked it. We didn＊t. We＊re tired of it.§ \nIn another tweet on the same day, Moore criticized evangelicals who continue to stand with Trump: ※Try to absorb how acceptable the disesteem and objectifying of women has been when some Christian leaders don＊t think it＊s that big a deal.§ \nIt would be interesting to ask Monica Lewinsky , Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, and Juanita Broaddrick which was most painful, words that Trump spoke 11 years ago 〞 and subsequently apologized for 〞 or Bill Clinton＊s actions and alleged actions, combined with Hillary Clinton＊s treatment of women who dared to speak up? source \n※And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.§ Revelation 18:4 (KJV) \nGeoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

According to Chomsky, his old-school audio cassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. \nThe tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton＊s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is ※rigged.§ Listen to never-before-seen audiotape of Crooked Hillary talking about rigging election in Palestine: \nSpeaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). \n※I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,§ said Sen. Clinton. ※And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.§ Chomsky recalls being taken aback that ※anyone could support the idea〞offered by a national political leader, no less〞that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.§ \nSome eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency. \nRegarding capturing combatants in war〞the June capture of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants who came across the Gaza border via an underground tunnel was very much front of mind〞Clinton can be heard on the tape saying, ※And then, when, you know, Hamas, you know, sent the terrorists, you know, through the tunnel into Israel that killed and captured, you know, kidnapped the young Israeli soldier, you know, there＊s a sense of like, one-upsmanship, and in these cultures of, you know, well, if they captured a soldier, we＊ve got to capture a soldier.§ Trump on Election Rigging | Third Presidential Debate Highlights \nEquating Hamas , which to this day remains on the State Department＊s official list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, with the armed forces of a close American ally was not what many expected to hear in the Jewish Press editorial offices, which were then at Third Avenue and Third Street in Brooklyn. (The paper＊s office has since moved to the Boro Park section of Brooklyn.) The use of the phrase ※these cultures§ is also a bit of a head-scratcher. \nAccording to Chomsky, Clinton was ※gracious, personable and pleasant throughout§ the interview, taking about an hour to speak to, in addition to himself, managing editor Jerry Greenwald, assistant to the publisher Naomi Klass Mauer, counsel Dennis Rapps and senior editor Jason Maoz. \nAnother part of the tape highlights something that was relatively uncontroversial at the time but has taken on new meaning in light of the current campaign〞speaking to leaders with whom our country is not on the best terms. Clinton has presented a very tough front in discussing Russia, for example, accusing Trump of unseemly ardor for strongman Vladimir Putin and mocking his oft-stated prediction that as president he＊d ※get along§ with Putin. \nChomsky is heard on the tape asking Clinton what now seems like a prescient question about Syria, given the disaster unfolding there and its looming threat to drag the U.S., Iran and Russia into confrontation. \n※Do you think it＊s worth talking to Syria〞both from the U.S. point [of view] and Israel＊s point [of view]?§ \nClinton replied, ※You know, I＊m pretty much of the mind that I don＊t see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as you＊re not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them,§ an answer that reflects her mastery of the facts but also reflects a willingness to talk to Russia that sounds more like Trump 2016 than Clinton 2016. \nShortly after, she said, ※But if you say, ＆they＊re evil, we＊re good, [and] we＊re never dealing with them,＊ I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them＃So I would like to talk to you [the enemy] because I want to know more about you. Because if I want to defeat you, I＊ve got to know something more about you. I need different tools to use in my campaign against you. That＊s my take on it.§ \nA final bit of interest to the current campaign involves an articulation of phrases that Trump has accused Clinton of being reluctant to use. Discussing the need for a response to terrorism, Clinton said, ※I think you can make the case that whether you call it ＆Islamic terrorism＊ or ＆Islamo-fascism,＊ whatever the label is we＊re going to give to this phenomenon, it＊s a threat. It＊s a global threat. To Europe, to Israel, to the United States＃Therefore we need a global response. It＊s a global threat and it needs a global response. That can be the, sort of, statement of principle＃So I think sometimes having the global vision is a help as long as you realize that underneath that global vision there＊s a lot of variety and differentiation that has to go on.§ \nIt＊s not clear what she means by a global vision with variety and differentiation, but what＊s quite clear is that the then-senator, just five years after her state was the epicenter of the September 11 attacks, was comfortable deploying the phrase ※Islamic terrorism§ and the even more strident ※Islamo-fascism,§ at least when meeting with the editorial board of a Jewish newspaper. \nIn an interview before the Observer heard the tape, Chomsky told the Observer that Clinton made some ※odd and controversial comments§ on the tape. The irony of a decade-old recording emerging to feature a candidate making comments that are suddenly relevant to voters today was not lost on Chomsky, who wrote the original story at the time. Oddly enough, that story, headlined ※Hillary Clinton on Israel, Iraq and Terror,§ is no longer available on jewishpress.com and even a short summary published on the Free Republic offers a broken link that can no longer surface the story. \n※I went to my bosses at the time,§ Chomsky told the Observer. ※The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody〞even a direct quote from anyone〞in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn＊t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.§",

There＊s no evidence to support the Republican nominee＊s claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include noncitizens.   29, 2016 Some Democrat-Run Cities Want Their Illegal Alien Population to Vote \nEDITOR＊S NOTE: Yesterday, FBI director James Comey announced that they have reopened the investigation into Crooked Hillary＊s illegal email server. Yay! But even before that, Democrat operatives are working around the clock to skew the election results in any way they can. Today we present to you Democrat-run cities in America allowing illegal immigrants to vote in the upcoming election. Should illegal immigrant voting be legal? Wha＃??? \n＆Look at illegal immigrants voting all over the country,＊ Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election. There＊s no evidence to support the Republican nominee＊s claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include non-citizens (illegal immigrants) . Trump Opposes Same-Day Voter Registration to Prevent Illegal Immigrants from Voting: \nThe latest is San Francisco , where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city＊s public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. ※One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn＊t have a voice,§ says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. ※We＊ve had legal immigrants who＊ve had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.§ Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the ※broken immigration system in this country.§ Should Illegal Immigrants Be Allowed to Vote in US Elections? \nToday there are six jurisdictions in Maryland that let non-citizens (illegal immigrants) vote in local elections. Chicago allows them to take part in elected parent advisory councils but not to vote in school board elections. Four towns in Massachusetts have moved to allow noncitizen voting and are awaiting state approval. And in New York City, where non-citizens (illegal immigrants) make up 21 percent of the voting-age population, the city council is drafting legislation that would allow more than 1.3 million legal residents to take part in municipal elections. The city previously allowed non-citizens (illegal immigrants) to vote in school board elections, but that ended when New York＊s school boards were dissolved in 2002. Liberals Sign Petition to Allow Illegal Immigrants to Vote in 2016 Presidential Election: \nSan Francisco has tried in the past to grant noncitizens access to school board elections. A 2004 measure narrowly failed, with 51 percent voting against it. ※There was an opposition campaign at that time,§ Chiu says. He sponsored another ballot measure in 2010, which also failed. This time, Chiu says, he＊s hoping for a victory. So far he＊s seen no organized opposition: ※I think that＊s because of the ugly, anti-immigrant statements expressed by Donald Trump and his supporters.§ SHARE THIS ARTICLE",

Knowing full well that he was 100% guilty as charged, he decided to look right into the unblinking eye of the camera and issue a full-throated denial of any involvement of any kind. Watch and see it for yourself: Bill Clinton denies having an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky: \nNow what Bill Clinton did not know was that Monica had saved a semen-stained blue dress with Bill Clinton＊s semen on it, which she promptly presented as evidence to prove that she was not lying. By this time she was being trashed by Clinton operatives desperate to save Bill＊s presidency, chief of whom was Crooked Hillary who had lots of nasty things to say about her husband＊s victims. That led to this moment as seen here: Bill Clinton admits to having an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky: Interestingly, in 2016 at the height of the race for president, Hillary decides to adopt Bill＊s bold denial strategy \nHillary Clinton＊s campaign hopes, as reported by Bloomberg today , its unusually swift response to revelations about a fresh FBI investigation into messages in connection with a past probe of her private e-mail server will blunt the political damage amid concern about close Senate races as well as the presidential election. \nWith nine days to go until the election , Clinton and her aides went on the attack, intensifying criticism of James Comey as word emerged that the FBI director defied U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch by informing lawmakers of newly discovered e-mails that may relate to its investigation of the Democratic presidential nominee. Hillary Clinton addresses FBI email investigation: \nClinton＊s aggressive strategy contrasts with her bunker mentality in previous episodes of the controversy over her e-mail practices at the State Department. Her campaign is taking a calculated risk in publicly criticizing Comey and pressing him to quickly release more detail. Should new information contradict past statements or call into question the judgment of Clinton or any of her advisers who migrated from the Obama administration to her campaign, it could be damaging. \nHer rival Donald Trump told an audience in Phoenix the ※only reason§ Comey must have felt the need to tell lawmakers of the newly discovered e-mails is that ※very, very serious things must be happening and must have been found. Very, very serious. Very, very serious.§ \nSince Crooked Hillary has no idea what the FBI actually found, her gambit is every bit as bold, and reckless, as was her husband＊s decades earlier.

WikiLeaks then showed us that Donna Brazile was feeding the interview questions from CNN to Crooked Hillary before the interviews and town halls took place. CNN today made a formal announcement of the severing their relationship with Donna Brazile.

In an email dated June 28, 2015, Abramovic wrote, ※I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina.§ Tony Podesta then forwarded the email to his brother John Podesta (Hillary Clinton＊s campaign chairman), asking him, ※Are you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner.§ What is ※spirit cooking§? Spirit cooking refers to ※a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley§ and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a ※painting§. The Podestas＊※Spirit Cooking§ dinner? It＊s not what you think. It＊s blood, sperm and breastmilk. \n〞 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 4, 2016 According to Marina Abramovic , if the ritual is performed in an art gallery, it is merely art, but if the ritual is performed privately, then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony. The video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony. Abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the ※recipe§ for the ※painting,§ which is comprised of the words, ※With a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain.§ The ceremony is, ※meant to symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine, which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism ※As Above, So Below.§ Marina Abramovic ＆Spirit Cooking＊: ※Abramovic is known for her often-gory art that confronts pain and ritual. Her first performance involved repeatedly, stabbing herself in her hands. The next performance featured her throwing her nails, toenails, and hair into a flaming five-point star 〞 which she eventually jumped inside of, causing her to lose consciousness,§ writes Cassandra Fairbanks. Another image shows Abramovic posing with a bloody goat＊s head 每 a representation of the occult symbol Baphomet. Spirit cooking is also an ※occult practice used during sex cult rituals, as explained in the book ※Spirit cooking with essential aphrodisiac recipes,§ notes Mike Cernovich. The revelation that John Podesta, Hillary Clinton＊s campaign chairman, is presumably interested in weird, gory occult ceremonies was too juicy for even Wikileaks to ignore. ※The Podestas＊ ※Spirit Cooking§ dinner? It＊s not what you think. It＊s blood, sperm and breastmilk. But mostly blood,§ the organization tweeted. Some are even linking the spirit cooking revelation to claims that the Podesta emails contain ※code for child sex trafficking§ that is hidden behind mentions of types of food. Others are connecting it to Laura Silsby , the missionary who was jailed for six months after her organization, New Life Children＊s Refuge, attempted to smuggle 33 children out of Haiti into the Dominican Republic after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

Assange was right. The real story was hidden in view.§ While the child trafficking and pedophile connections to Clinton remain unproven, the fact that her campaign chairman is apparently into spooky occult rituals involving menstrual blood and semen is easily one of the most disturbing Wikileaks revelations to date. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received 4 percent support, while Green party nominee Jill Stein received 3 percent. One percent of the respondents said that they were supporting someone else, and five percent said they were still undecided.   Republican nominee Donald Trump is tied with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Michigan, according to a Strategic National Poll. \nThe Michigan statewide poll revealed Trump is now dead even with Clinton , in a state that has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. \nTrump and Clinton both received 44 percent support from respondents in a poll conducted Nov. 3, which was obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received 4 percent support, while Green party nominee Jill Stein received 3 percent. One percent of the respondents said that they were supporting someone else, and five percent said they were still undecided. \nThe survey , conducted by Strategic National , a Republican leaning consulting firm based in Michigan, contacted 573 likely voters in the State of Michigan on Nov. 3. The survey reported that 39 percent of the respondents were affiliated with the Democratic Party, 34 percent affiliated with the GOP, 21 percent affiliated with an independent or third party, and 5 percent said they were ※unsure§ of their party affiliation. Donald Trump MASSIVE Rally in Warren, Michigan: \nClinton is scheduled to make an appearance in Detroit Friday afternoon. Clinton will attempt to inject enthusiasm into reliable Democratic Party voters that came out for President Barack Obama in full force both in 2008 and 2012. Trump appeared at two rallies in the state Monday, and his children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka stumped around the state this week. \nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz appeared at a campaign rally with vice presidential candidate Mike Pence Thursday in Portage, Mich. on the state＊s west side 〞 an area where Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich performed well in the GOP primary. \nBoth candidates have made ※ six-figure § advertising purchases in the state in the last days before the election. Clinton＊s campaign dumped $2.5 million in Michigan in two days alone, according to tabloid news outlet TMZ . Laura Ingraham on Why Trump Can Pull Off an Election Upset Over Clinton on Tuesday: \nClinton enjoyed as much as a 13-point advantage over Trump in Michigan just two weeks ago. The Democratic nominee has not made Michigan a regular campaign stop while Trump has focused on the state and other rust belt states as a potential path to victory. \nWhile Michigan hasn＊t voted for a Republican candidate for president since President George H. W. Bush in 1988, the state is home to vast swaths of conservative-leaning precincts and a well-established state party apparatus. Michigan＊s governor and both legislative chambers are controlled by Republicans and the state＊s congressional delegation is made up of nine Republicans and five Democrats. \nDemocrats have been able to win presidential elections by ※running up the score§ in its urban areas and population bases, something Clinton hoped would keep the state safely in her corner without diverting resources and time from other battleground states. \n※Trump is over performing in key segments of the electorate especially in rural areas and Macomb County while Clinton is failing to get the numbers she needs out of the city of Detroit,§ John Yob, CEO of Strategic National, who conducted the poll, reported. \nOut of the poll＊s respondents , 75 percent were contacted by landline, while 25 percent were contacted over cellular phone. The poll was conducted through landlines, using Interactive Voice Response and the margin of error for the poll is 4.09 percent. source",

    "text": "BOMBSHELL: Crooked Hillary Sent Classified Info To Chelsea Under Fake Name ＆Diane Reynolds＊ But perhaps the most significant part of the email is that Clinton forwarded classified information to her daughter, who is and was a private citizen with no government role and no apparent security clearances. It is unclear when or why Clinton deleted the email.   Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted a 2009 email in which she forwarded classified information to her daughter, Chelsea. \nEDITOR＊S NOTE: The State Department today released recovered emails from Crooked Hillary＊s illegal private email server, and guess what? It contained classified and confidential information. Who did she send it to? She sent it to her daughter, who was no clearance or authorization of any kind to view or receive such communications. Now do you see why Crooked Hillary deleted those 33,000 emails so no one could see them (she thought)? And oh, by the way, Chelsea used the fake name of Diane Reynolds to receive the illegally -sent emails. Think they knew they were breaking the law? Yep. \nThe email was released on Friday by the State Department. It is one of thousands of emails recovered by the FBI from Clinton＊s private email server. \nThe Dec. 20, 2009 email chain , entitled ※Update,§ started with a message from Michael Froman, who served as a deputy assistant to President Obama and deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs. \nThe email, which is redacted because it contains information classified as ※Confidential,§ was sent to Jake Sullivan, Clinton＊s foreign policy adviser at the State Department, and several Obama aides. Sullivan sent it to Hillary Clinton who then forwarded it to Chelsea, who emailed under the pseudonym ※Diane Reynolds.§ \nAll of the text in the body portion of the classified emails is redacted because it contains foreign government information. \nThe State Department labeled the email a ※near duplicate,§ indicating that it was mostly similar to other emails that the agency has released from the trove of emails that Clinton turned over in Dec. 2014. Clinton did not delete other responses she made to others on the email thread. \n※Wow 〞 you can＊t make this up 〞 sorry to have missed all of that! Let me know if you learn anything else,§ she wrote to Sullivan. The State Department released that portion of the email conversation in February. CHELSEA CLINTON USED THE PSEUDONYM OF ＆DIANE REYNOLDS＊ TO RECEIVE ILLEGAL EMAILS \nBut perhaps the most significant part of the email is that Clinton forwarded classified information to her daughter, who is and was a private citizen with no government role and no apparent security clearances. \nIt is unclear when or why Clinton deleted the email. She gave the State Department around 30,000 emails she claimed were related to her State Department work. She deleted a similar number claiming they were personal and dealt with yoga routines, food recipes and Chelsea＊s wedding. \nFBI director James Comey said in July that investigators recovered several thousand work-related emails from Clinton＊s server.

    "text": "NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Hillary Supporters Jay-Z And Beyonce Are Members Of Aleister Crowley＊s Satanic Cult OTO Other celebrities linked to OTO include the rapper Jay-Z, who has repeatedly purloined imagery and quotations from Crowley＊s work. Whether wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with ＆Do what thou wilt＊ or hiring Rihanna to hold aloft a flaming torch in his music videos (a reference to the Illuminati, an outlawed secret society whose name supposedly derives from Lucifer, or ＆light bringer＊), he has given the sect priceless publicity. by Geoffrey Grider November 5, 2016 Aleister Crowley, who was born into an upper-class British family in 1875, styled himself as ＆the Great Beast 666＊. He was an unabashed occultist who, prior to his death in 1947, revelled in his infamy as ＆the wickedest man in the world＊. \n※And he was withdrawn from them about a stone＊s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.§ Luke 22:41,42 (KJV) \nHis form of worship involved sadomasochistic sex rituals with men and women, spells which he claimed could raise malevolent gods and the use of hard drugs, including opium, cocaine, heroin and mescaline. \nCrowley＊s motto 〞 perpetuated by OTO ( Ordo Templi Orientis ), 〞 was ＆do what thou wilt＊. And it is this individualistic approach that has led to a lasting fascination among artists and celebrities. Led Zeppelin＊s Jimmy Page, for example, routinely took part in occult magical rituals and was so intrigued by Crowley he bought his former home, Boleskine House, on the shores of Loch Ness in Scotland. And there are now OTO lodges scattered around the country, practising the same ceremonial rituals and spreading the word of Crowley. Jay-Z and Beyonce are leading the way \nOther celebrities linked to OTO include the rapper Jay-Z , who has repeatedly purloined imagery and quotations from Crowley＊s work. Whether wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with ＆Do what thou wilt＊ or hiring Rihanna to hold aloft a flaming torch in his music videos (a reference to the Illuminati , an outlawed secret society whose name supposedly derives from Lucifer, or ＆light bringer＊), he has given the sect priceless publicity. \nHis clothing line , Rocawear , is shot through with OTO imagery such as the ＆all seeing eye＊ in a triangle, the ＆eye of Horus＊ (an ancient Egyptian symbol frequently referenced in occult texts) and the head of Baphomet (the horned, androgynous idol of?Western occultism). Beyonc谷 Knowles admits demon possession by Sasha Fierce: \nSome conspiracy theorists have seized on this as evidence that he is a member of a secret Masonic movement which they believe permeates the highest levels of business and government. Others take a more pragmatic view: that it is commercial opportunism, cashing in on impressionable teens＊ attraction to the ＆edginess＊ of occult symbolism. Yet OTO is much more than a marketing opportunity for attention-seeking celebs. It is a living religion, with adherents still practising occult rituals set out by Crowley in his books. \nThis week I tracked down John Bonner, 62, the head of OTO in the UK, to his home in East Sussex. He told me: ＆We are not a mass-appeal sort of organisation 〞 in the UK we number in our hundreds. Worldwide it＊s thousands. Hillary Clinton gets in formation with Jay Z and Beyonce: \nCelebrities are not always a boon or a benefit. ＆We are used to being misunderstood. Many stories about Crowley, like people saying he filed his teeth down into fangs, are nonsense. \n＆YOU COULD CALL US A SEX CULT IN A WAY, BECAUSE WE RECOGNISE, ACCEPT AND ADORE THE WHOLE PROCESS WHICH GOES TOWARDS MAKING TANGIBLE THE PREVIOUSLY INTANGIBLE.＊ According to adherents of OTO it takes years of study before you can begin to understand what the religion is about 〞 much like the equally controversial Church of Scientology. \nA former FBI agent , Ted Gundersen, who investigated Satanic circles in LA, found that Crowley＊s teachings about ＆raising demons to do one＊s bidding＊ suggested human sacrifice, preferably of ＆an intelligent young boy＊. \nJohn Bonner is dismissive of any idea that he and his fellow believers would even begin to countenance such excesses, pointing out that his is the only religion that sends people a letter of congratulations when they decide to leave (＆because they are exercising free will, which is what we＊re all about＊). \nBut he accepts many people may not be able to deal with Crowley＊s complex teachings. \n＆You＊re not supposed to just jump straight in to it. It takes time and study, but our rituals are not for public consumption. You need to join us and go through the initiation process before you can begin to understand. ＆But according to our beliefs we can＊t turn anyone away.

'But we will never be stopped. Never, never be stopped.''I want to thank the Secret Service. These guys are fantastic. They don't get enough credit. They don't get enough credit. They're amazing people.'   5, 2016 Secret Service agents rushed Donald trump offstage on Saturday evening during a rally in Reno, Nevada after they determined a protester in the audience with a gun posed a threat to the Republican presidential candidate. ＆Go! Go!＊ they shouted as they whisked him away and a combination of local police and private security wrestled the suspect to the ground. Thousands of people scattered like a sea of bodies, screams rang out and authorities dragged the man away as he kicked and strained. Trump returned to the stage just five minutes later. ＆Nobody said it was going to be easy for us,＊ Trump declared. ＆But we will never be stopped.

JUST NOW: Donald Trump was just rushed off stage during his Nevada campaign rally: https://t.co/7fTJ3N3MQN pic.twitter.com/Hm7CRdFDTU \n〞 CBS News (@CBSNews) November 6, 2016 Federal agents and tactical officers from Reno Police removed the man and placed him in a bathroom near a secure entrance where Trump＊s motorcade and the press vehicles were staged. Two audience members told DailyMail.com that they had seen the man holding a firearm. That has not been confirmed by law enforcement. As police and good Samaritans took him down, the crowd surged backward and strained against the press section. ＆CNN sucks!＊ one man yelled. ＆You people caused this!＊ Audience members at the front of the crowd reportedly said they saw the man raise up a sign before a scuffle ensued. Saturday＊s incident marked the second time Secret Service had to intervene to get Trump out of harm＊s way. In March a man leaped over a police barricade during a Trump rally at an airport hangar in Dayton, Ohio. The man,Thomas Dimassimo, was charged with disorderly conduct and inciting panic, but he never reached the stage. Secret Service tackled him when he was still several yards away from the candidate. ＆I was ready for him, but it＊s much easier if the cops do it, don＊t we agree?＊ Trump said at the time. ＆And to think I had such an easy life!

By casting your vote to stop her, you can decide if America will be made great again, or whether we will wallow in a festering swamp of corruption. The choice is all yours, America. by Geoffrey Grider November 7, 2016 Crooked Hillary, Slick Willy, and the entire Clinton Crime Family organization represent the very worst of a corrupt system that has been allowed to operate for far too long. \n※When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.§ Proverbs 29:2 (KJV) \nOn November 8th , the American people will have the opportunity to do what the FBI and the Department of Justice refuse to do, deliver a guilty verdict against Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Donald Trump＊s Argument For America: WikiLeaks: DNC and CNN colluded on questions for Trump, Cruz Newly released emails from WikiLeaks suggest that the Democratic National Committee colluded with CNN in devising questions in April to be asked of then-Republican primary candidate Donald Trump in an upcoming interview. In an email to DNC colleagues on April 25 with the headline ※Trump Questions for CNN,§ a DNC official with the email username asked for ideas for an interview to be conducted by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer.§Wolf Blitzer is interviewing Trump on Tues ahead of his foreign policy address on Wed. ＃ Please send me thoughts by 10:30 AM tomorrow.§The sender of the email would seem to be DNC Research Director Lauren Dillon, who was identified in previous reports of DNC emails released by WikiLeaks in July.

Staffers were going to put on a two-minute show over the Hudson River after the results come in on Tuesday, but the proposal has been canned, TMZ reported on Monday. The campaign called the Coast Guard last week to tell them the event was off, three days after the New York Post reported it was planning the bash 每 although the cancellation was secret until Monday. It emerged as fresh projections of the electoral college showed she has lost the iron grip pollsters believed she had on the 270 college votes needed for victory. CNN has moved Ohio, Utah and one district of Maine from toss-up to leaning Republican, and New Hampshire from leaning Democratic to toss-up. That changes the math significantly for Clinton, putting her projected total at 268 and Trump＊s at 204 每 with the rest of the votes to be fought over. 10 Things You Didn＊t Know About Hillary Clinton: Until now she had been above 270. Fox News has changed its projection too, making Utah and North Carolina toss-ups, rather than leaning towards Clinton, while Arizona and Iowa move to leaning Republican. And a series of other measures pointed to a far tighter race than some pundits had predicted. In Florida, early voting figures obtained by the Drudge Report suggested Trump was doing better than Mitt Romney, and Hillary Clinton was under-performing Barack Obama in 2012. Similarly, Drudge reported that North Carolina had seen Trump exceed early voting expectations. The figures showed Trump behind be 305,000 when Romney was behind by 447,000 每 a deficit which he still won the state from. The cancellation of the fireworks emerged three days after FBI director James Comey told Congress his agency was investigating a trove of emails found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The cancellation was made Thursday 每 before Comey wrote again to Congress to say that the FBI had not found anything to justify changing its verdict of no charges to the Democrat about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Still, Clinton＊s campaign suffered collateral damage in the nine days which elapsed between the letters. source \nGeoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

After Hillary Clinton posed for photos with the media covering her, she was confused about whether she needed to board the awaiting plane or get in the motorcade that had just dropped her off. \nHillary Clinton was at the White Plains, New York airport about to start her day, when she exhibited some startling behavior . It was the very beginning of her day, so presumably she was rested and alert as she prepared to hit the campaign trail. Yet when speaking with the loud mob of reporters, she appeared to speak gibberish mixed in with her sentences, and laughing awkwardly even though nothing funny was being said. Then it got really weird. Shocking Video Footage Of A Confused Hillary Clinton Mumbling Gibberish On Campaign Trail \nAs she walks in the direction of her personal campaign plane, she suddenly freezes and is not sure whether she needs to get into the motorcade which had just dropped her off, or board the plane like she was supposed to do. \nA few seconds later , her handlers become aware that she＊s having another Parkinson＊s freeze moment , and immediately swarm around her pushing the video cameras backwards. But not before video of her is recorded showing she doesn＊t know what she＊s supposed to do. Hillary＊s Health: More than just a cough \nThe cameras capture her saying ※where am I going§? and then ※what am I doing§? before she disappears into the protective huddle of her watchers. \nThis stands is very stark contrast to am energized Donald Trump, making nearly a dozen stops in a 24 hour period and speaking for almost an hour wherever he goes. Hillary Clinton barely has the energy to get out of her car, and when she does get out, she has no idea what to do after that. \nThis deceitful woman is not only hiding her crimes and scandals , she and her people are also hiding the fact that she is very ill and physically unfit to serve for 4 years as president of the United States.

He said issuing the pardon could help heal the nation, like Ford's pardon of Nixon did.   16, 2016 Speaking at President Gerald Ford＊s alma mater, The Rev. Jesse Jackson called for President Obama to issue a blanket pardon to Hillary Clinton before he leaves office, just like Ford did for Richard Nixon. \nStopping short of saying Clinton did anything wrong , Jackson told a large crowd of University of Michigan students, faculty and administrators gathered at daylong celebration of his career that Obama should short-circuit President-elect Donald Trump＊s promised attempt to prosecute Hillary Clinton for use of a private e-mail server. \n※It would be a monumental moral mistake to pursue the indictment of Hillary Clinton,§ Jackson said. He said issuing the pardon could help heal the nation, like Ford＊s pardon of Nixon did. Would Obama pardon Clinton before he leaves office? \n※President Ford said we don＊t need him for trophy. We need to move on. President Nixon wasn＊t convicted of a crime. He didn＊t apply for a pardon.

It will not stop until they find a reason to put her in jail. That would be a travesty.§ \nIn 1974, Ford, a University of Michigan alumnus, issued a full and complete pardon of Nixon for any crimes he may have committed. He said the pardon was in the best interests of the nation. \nJackson＊s comments came at the end of a long day in Ann Arbor, which included him dropping in on an anti-Trump rally held by students on campus. Jesse Jackson: Obama should pardon Hillary Clinton \nJackson comes to a campus that is full of strife over race. Numerous racist flyers have been posted and students have alleged they have been attacked because they are Muslim or a minority. There have been anti-Trump marches on U-M＊s campus, along with campuses across the nation. A large demonstration marched through a series of U-M buildings even while Jackson was speaking. \nStudents ※are growing up in an America that is in an identity crisis,§ Jackson said. ※These demonstrations are born out of fear. Fear that the Klan will ride again. Fear that violence (against minorities) is coming back. \n※In this election, voters voted for fear. I think hope will defeat hate, but it＊s a battle.§ In a conversation with the Free Press at the beginning of the day, he blamed Trump for the environment of fear. \nDonald Trump saw an America that was a dry field, and instead of watering it to get the grass growing again, he threw a lit match on it, Jackson said. \nNow it＊s up to Trump to take action, Jackson added. \n※The one who set the field afire must be the one to put it out,§ he told the Free Press in a one-on-one interview. ※He had the option to pour water on it (the dry field) and let it grow. He didn＊t do that 〞 he chose to light it on fire. One of my concerns is that we see the division in America now because of that. We see classmates, roommates in a conflict over the way the campaign turned out. \n※He knows Mexicans didn＊t take jobs from us. It was the corporations. He knows you can＊t deport 15 million (immigrants). It＊s not just about the adults, but also about the children who were born here, grew up here and go to school here.§ \nJackson told students not to give up the struggle. \n※Students, don＊t let them take your hope. Deep water doesn＊t drown you. You drown because you stop kicking. There is a tug of war for the soul of America. Do we want to be an aristocracy or a democracy?

And I＊ve received dozens and dozens of those emails. Even the non-threatening-my-life emails are very aggressive,§ Michael Banerian told the Detroit News, adding that he has been labeled a ※hateful bigot§ by the same people who are violently threatening him. A petition to demand electors change their vote to Clinton has also surpassed 4.5 million signatures. Meanwhile on Twitter , Hillary supporters are organizing on how to pressure electors under the hashtag #HamiltonElectors , a reference to Mike Pence being lectured by a cast member of the musical show. Unfortunately for them, conservatives found the hashtag and have now largely taken it over to decry leftists attempting to overturn the results of a democratic election. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE",

The pro-Hillary computer scientists want the Clinton campaign to contest the election results.

The allegations say Clinton won 7 percent fewer votes in counties that use electronic voting, compared with counties that rely on paper ballots in the state of Wisconsin. \nThe campaign was told that the margin of suspicious votes would swing 30,000 votes to Clinton＊s favor. Clinton only lost Wisconsin to Donald Trump in the presidential election earlier this month by .7 percentage points, or around 27,000 votes.

    "title": "Republicans Just Revealed They＊re ALREADY Plotting ※Years§ Of Hillary Investigations",
    "text": "Comments \nThe House GOP are preparing for a Clinton presidency by doing absolutely nothing to change their plans, announcing the threat of continued investigations into soon-to-be President-elect Hillary Clinton, which they warn will go on for years. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) is spearheading the charges against her, in spite of un-endorsing Trump just two weeks ago. \n※Even before we get to Day One, we＊ve got two years＊ worth of material already lined up. She has four years of history at the State Department, and it ain＊t good,§ he threatened. \nAlthough Clinton is predicted to win by a landslide majority, Republicans could retain control of the House due to conservative voting at the local level decades of extensive jerrymandering by Republican statehouses. This might make Clinton be the first president since George H.W. Bush to deal with a House Oversight Committee controlled by their opposing party in her first term. \nOf course, other Republicans agree with the efforts to take down Clinton, gleefully planning to exacerbate political divisions and distaste in this country and recreating the climate that led to Trump getting as far as he has. \nThe office of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) issued a statement saying, ※The rigorous oversight conducted by House Republicans has already brought to light troubling developments in the [Hillary] Clinton email scandal. The speaker supports [Oversight＊s] investigative efforts following where the evidence leads, especially where it shows the need for changes in the law.§ \nThe thought of Republicans wasting additional time and money on trying to take down Clinton is a spit in the face to her campaign. David Brock, leader of the American Bridge PAC, accusing Chaffetz of squandering taxpayer dollars on his nonsense investigation. ※It＊s clear Congressman Chaffetz is ready to spend resources on additional worthless political investigations that will, again, come up with nothing,§ he commented. \nRep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), a ranking member of the Oversight Committee and the Select Committee on Benghazi, echoed these sentiments, explaining, ※Republicans are pretending like they haven＊t been investigating Secretary Clinton for years ever since she announced that she was running for president, including everything from Benghazi to emails to the Clinton Foundation. It＊s no exaggeration to say that on the first day Secretary Clinton walks into the White House, Republicans will have already investigated her more than any other president in history.§ \nChaffetz＊s anticipated investigation may be reliant on stolen documents, sourced via WikiLeaks, though he claims he doesn＊t ※want to be dealing with that.§ When asked if this will resemble Watergate, Chaffetz tries to warn that it could go that far depending on cooperation. \nThe one thing Chaffetz hasn＊t accounted for? A Trump presidency. ※Heaven help us!§ he says, laughing. ※Please, no! I＊m not even going to think about that one. I can＊t even utter the sentence out loud.§ \nIn spite of Republicans voting Clinton on Election Day, they are still acting like whiny children, stopping at nothing to push their counter-intuitive political agenda on America. It is a prime example of Republican hypocrisy, and selfish refusal to let the country run optimally in favor of the agendas of their corporate masters and the monied elites.",

    "title": "The Yale Review Did Not Endorse Hillary. The Reason Why Is Hilarious",
    "text": "Posted on October 27, 2016 \nThe editorial board at the Yale Review gave the most curious non-endorsement of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton this election season has yet seen 每 and with a lesson that most of the Republican political complex and especially nominee Donald Trump should learn, quickly, if he wants to keep himself out of even more legal trouble. \nIn its 144-year history, The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. In fact, we have never endorsed any candidate for president. This is, in part, due to our strong commitment to being a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, which mandates that we are ※absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.§ \nThis year＊s presidential election is highly unusual, but ultimately no different: The Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally un-endorsable, due to our faithful compliance with the tax code. \nIn particular, we do not endorse Hillary Clinton＊s exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye. We do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this country〞a commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career. Because of unambiguous tax law, we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern American history, nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8. \nThe Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr. Jill Stein. \nTax-exempt organizations like The Yale Record and the Donald J Trump Foundation must obey certain rules to keep their tax-exempt status 每 rules that the Trump Foundation has been flouting for its entire existence. Trump＊s been using his private foundation 每 which is funded almost entirely by the donations of other people 每 to purchase the political support of different groups throughout his campaign , among other more personal purchases like a $20,000 painting of himself , in clear violation of the tax-exempt rules. \nTrump＊s foundation has already been suspended from operating in New York for not having the right certification to solicit donors . Such a flagrant disrespect for the laws of the land and of the spirit of ※charity§ reveal just what kind of man Donald Trump is 每 a greedy narcissist with no regard for the well-being of others. So take this non-endorsement to heart and applaud their respect for the rules governing tax-exempt organizations. OccupyDemocrats, however, is under no such restrictions, and we heartily encourage you to help shatter the glass ceiling and make former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton our next president.",

    "text": "Comments \nNews leaked from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton＊s camp that her transition team wants to persuade or even draft Joe Biden to continue serving America as our nation＊s top diplomat after his term as Vice President expires in January. Biden chose not to run to succeed President Obama after the tragic loss of his son Beau Biden; instead he＊s thrown himself fully into campaigning for Clinton＊s election as only one of America＊s most beloved public figures can do. Politico reports : \nJoe Biden is at the top of the internal short list Hillary Clinton＊s transition team is preparing for her pick to be secretary of state, a source familiar with the planning tells POLITICO. ※He＊d be great, and they are spending a lot of time figuring out the best way to try to persuade him to do it if she wins,§ said the source familiar with the transition planning. \nThe vice president, who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before joining the administration, is one of the most experienced and respected Democrats on the world stage. He＊s also coming to what would be the close of a 44-year career in Washington, first with six terms in the Senate and then two terms as President Barack Obama＊s closest adviser 〞 and the keeper of the portfolio on some of the most difficult international issues, including Iraq and Ukraine. \nHillary hasn＊t even told Biden about her idea yet, but it is a logical choice by the Democrat. The news represents a little more traditional political fare for people who are concerned about both the issues a President must master to govern America, but also the team of people they＊ll need to manage our country＊s affairs. There＊s a lot of work to do by the Clinton campaign before naming anyone to any position, but Democrats have closed the gap in absentee early voting with Republicans in key swing states 每 like Ohio and also in Florida to date. \nJoe Biden is also one amazing politician on the campaign trail, who managed to bait Republican nominee into a verbal sparring match which is distracting his campaign from doing much else than playing defense. Nobody knows if Joe Biden will accept Hillary Clinton＊s offer, if the Democratic nominee does in fact become the first female President elect after November 8th, but we do all know that Joe Biden＊s heavyweight speeches are having a major impact on this year＊s general election campaign. \nJust watch him nail Trump: Trump responds to @JoeBiden ＊s wish to fight him: 'I'd love that' pic.twitter.com/oDWh0xuShd",

    "text": "Comments \nVarious media outlets jumped the gun today when they raced each other to announce that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had reopened their investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton＊s emails. But less than two hours later it＊s clear that what actually happened has been blown way out of proportion and out of context. \nFBI Director James Comey announced to Congress today that ※investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ＆appear to be pertinent＊ to the email probe. Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update you.§ Clarifying: Comey doesn＊t say the FBI is reopening the Clinton investigation per se, rather that it＊s assessing newly found emails. \n〞 Shane Harris (@shaneharris) October 28, 2016 \nThe investigation is not ※reopened§每 technically, it was never closed. \nThe new emails were not ※hidden§ or ※recovered§ or related to her email server in any way. \nThe emails were discovered on the cellular device of former Congressman Anthony Wiener as part of an unrelated probe into whether or not Wiener was sending sexually explicit messages and photographs to minors. What the new emails contain is anyone＊s guess, but they are not to or from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Wiener＊s soon-to-be ex-wife Huma Abedin is a longtime aide to Clinton. \nThe media has been just as complicit as the Republican witch-hunters in Congress in perpetuating these baseless smears against the credibility of Hillary Clinton, one of our nation＊s most dedicated public servants. \nWhile Republicans are leaping on this news in hopes it will revive Republican nominee Donald Trump＊s flailing campaign, these ※developments§ are nothing but a non-story from an overly impressionable media desperate for views on a slow Friday afternoon and deserves no more of your time.",

    "text": "Comments \n  has filed a federal complaint against FBI Director James Comey for the inappropriate partisan use of his official position as the leader our nation＊s top federal law enforcement agency. Yesterday, FBI Comey issued a vaguely worded memo to Congressional Republicans about an email loosely linked toHillary Clinton, which House Republican Jason Chaffetz quickly used to punk the media on Twitter, leading to a swirl of false stories about Clinton and emails 〞 most of which required corrections. \nThe Department of Justice＊s Office of Special Counsel is in charge of enforcing Hatch Act violations when federal employees like FBI Director Comey abuse their offices for political reasons. That＊s where DCAT sent their harshly worded complaint: ※This is an election year, and we are just 11 days away from the date that the American public votes to choose the next President of the United States, I am writing to ask that an investigation be opened into Director Comey for any potential violations of the Hatch Act. The timing of this announcement, accompanied by the vague facts of the investigation, seems as if Director Comey was making a political move, and not a professional one.§ [text of complaint]   filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility on Friday against FBI Director James Comey for interfering in the Presidential election, following the FBI＊s decision to open up an investigation into Secretary Clinton＊s emails this close to Election Day. Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act. ※It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,§ said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. ※ It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.§ Most federal employees are prohibited from engaging in partisan electioneering under federal law by ※ An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities,§ otherwise known as the Hatch Act. It makes very narrow exceptions for partisan campaigning by the President, Vice President and a few designated high-ranking members of the Executive Branch of government.

    "text": "Comments FBI Director James Comey just followed up his first memo to Congress with a ※cover your ass§ memo to his staff in The Washington Post. The impact within the FBI has been swift after the first memo. Newsweek is reporting that the Republican FBI Director＊s inappropriate letter to Congress put him in a very danger of a ※mutiny at the FBI,§ whose proper role is protecting America from domestic terror threats and investigating serious crimes 每 not influencing elections. In the FBI Director＊s second letter, he admitted that his agency doesn＊t ※ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations,§ and that he doesn＊t know anything about, ※the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.§ He also claimed that, ※I don＊t want to create a misleading impression,§ and Comey then made a final admission that, ※in the middle of an election season, there is a signficant risk of being misunderstood.§ Well, it＊s too late now. FBI Dir. Comey sent a second letter today 每 to FBI employees. He seems to have some doubts about what he did (via WashPost) pic.twitter.com/IagFJRZYyU \n〞 West Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) October 29, 2016 Newsweek＊s report about this latest non-scandal points out firmly that the FBI Director＊s letter literally points out emails that have nothing to do with the Democratic nominee. \nThe disclosure by the Federal Bureau of Investigation late on Friday, October 28 that it had discovered potential new evidence in its inquiry into Hillary Clinton＊s handling of her personal email when she was Secretary of State has virtually nothing to do with any actions taken by the Democratic nominee, according to government records and an official with knowledge of the investigation, who spoke to Newsweek on condition of anonymity. The revelation that the FBI has discovered additional emails convulsed the political world, and led to widespread (and erroneous) claims and speculation. \nMoreover, despite the widespread claims in the media that this development had prompted the FBI to ※reopen§ of the case, it did not; What we know: FBI found some emails on a new device. They dont know whats in them or if they're copies or if they're classified. That's it. \n〞 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 Sources inside the FBI told Newsweek they were furious with Director Comey＊s rare public revelations from the Clinton investigation from the start. Comey＊s decision to leak news about a politically driven investigation is threatening his professional standing and ability to function inside the Bureau. Newsweek＊s top investigative reporter Kurt Eichenwald told the story in a tweetstorm: Word from inside @FBI . FURIOUS at Comey, think he's mishandled public revelations from get go. \"Outrageous incompetence\" one agent told me. \n〞 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 If Comey doesn't get ahead of this, going to have a mutiny at @FBI . \"This is why u say 'We dont talk about investigations'\" one told me＃. \n〞 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 ＃his original decision to lay out info on clinton case, then opine on what it meant outside of criminal findings, infuriated these folks.. \n〞 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 ＃to begin with, because it was inappropriate precedent set. Then it set him up for what he did today, and because he knew how angry＃ \n〞 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 ＃people inside were with him, he was trying to play to two audiences 〞 updating his testimony while not revealing too much. But that＃. \n〞 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 ＃.just made everything worse. \n〞 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 \nThe FBI has a difficult job to perform in the best of times, and when it comes to political investigations agents must walk a tightrope between performing their duties properly, and unduly influencing public opinion with the results of their investigations. For an entire year, they managed to quietly, but diligently investigate the sensitive matters surrounding Hillary Clinton＊s emails which they ultimately concluded, ※were not a cliff-hanger§ because there was literally no there, there. \nThese events show precisely why the FBI does not ordinarily publicly release the results or targets of their investigations until charges are filed. \nThese memos have set off a chain off events sure to end with the termination of his tenure as head of the agency. A serious criminal complaint has already been levied against him by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump for engaging in partisan activity. Related Items:",

Trump himself drew an unprecedented public scolding from the Secret Service for saying that ※ second amendment people § should take matters into their own hands if/when he Hillary beats him. \nTrump＊s sycophantic surrogates Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani completely debased the high titles of their former prosecutorial offices within the federal government by calling for Hillary Clinton to be ※locked up.§ Sadly, that has become the only policy proposal of the Republican Party 〞 beyond Trump＊s plans to kiss up to Russia＊s dictator Vladimir Putin and Mike Pence＊s plan to manage women＊s health with scripture. \nNow, Trump＊s followers have internalized the calls for political violence, and here is is the result in suburban Michigan: \nIt doesn＊t get any more deplorable than this, folks.",

    "text": "Comments \nIn the wake of a string of completely extraordinary revelations starting this summer by FBI Director James Comey, Senator Warren is now demanding that the FBI release investigatory details about the 14 corporations and 11 individuals which the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) referred for criminal prosecution in 2010; \n※Your recent actions with regard to the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provide a clear precedent for releasing additional information about the investigation of the parties responsible for the financial crisis. \nThese new standards present a compelling case for public transparency around the fate of the FCIC referrals. If Secretary Clinton＊s email server was of sufficient interest to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then surely the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency. \nAs a consequence of the 2008 crash, trillions of dollars in American housing wealth was destroyed. Millions of Americans were touched personally as they lost their homes, their jobs, or both. Hundreds of pension funds were eviscerated, and millions of retirees saw their financial futures wiped out. Congress created the FCIC to examine what went wrong and to determine Whether any individuals or entities deserved law enforcement scrutiny as a result of their actions in this crisis. The FCIC followed the law and sent such referrals to the DOJ, yet not a single senior Wall Street executive has ever been criminally prosecuted. \nFor the uncounted millions of Americans whose lives were changed forever and for those who are still dealing with the consequences of the crash, I can think of no matter of intense public interest about which the American people deserve the details than the issue of what precisely happened to the criminal referrals that followed the 2008 crash.§ \nUntil now, the FBI has never, ever released the investigatory file of anyone or any institution it has targeted. However, if the Democratic nominee herself was a bank, then she would have nothing to fear from the FBI. \nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is laser focused on protecting the American people from shady banks and financial scams, but the newly transparent FBI apparently doesn＊t share her concern since those investigations don＊t involve Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. To date, no executive has been criminally prosecuted for financial crimes by banks, Wall Street firms and lending institutions which caused the Great Bush Recession＊s mass unemployment and foreclosure epidemic. \nOf 25 entities named by the FCIC to be criminally investigated , only one actual person has paid a civil penalty, and another person 每 none other than Daniel Mudd, former CEO of mortgage giant Fannie Mae, was fined 〞 but had his $100,000 penalty paid by the government sponsored enterprise that employed him. \nFBI Director James Comey has deployed a massive double standard to protect the criminal financial institutions, handing them a free pass and complete secrecy for collapsing our national economy and wiping out $3 Trillion dollars in home equity, stock equity and savings, while dragging Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton through the mud for Comey＊s partisan predilections for transparency when she＊s demonstrably done absolutely nothing wrong. \nThe FBI Director himself admitted in July that ※no reasonable prosecutor§ would bring charges against the Democratic nominee, yet he himself cannot resist rehashing and releasing the investigatory details in public over and over. Releasing anything about an investigation, or even delivering an actual indictment, actually violates Department of Justice policy to remain silent in the 60 days before an election. It＊s been described by former top Justice Department officials as the ※difference between being independent and flying solo.§ \nElizabeth is right. How long will the FBI wait to deliver transparency to the American people eight years after their jobs, homes and savings were attacked by irresponsible bankers? \nOnce the FBI completes disclosing those investigatory files, then how long will it take for them to deliver indictments and justice to the men and women who caused the Great Recession? \nNeither can happen soon enough. For now, he needs to stop his partisan witch-hunt against Hillary and start going after the real crook.s",

    "text": "Comments \nDemocratic Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) was the ranking minority member on the House Benghazi committee, so he knows firsthand how Republican witch-hunts work from up close personal experience. \nOn CNN＊s New Day this morning, he revealed the real motivation behind the FBI Director＊s stunningly improper memo to Congress last week. \n※I don＊t think the American people have a clue how hard the Republicans 每 particularly on my committee 每 have been on the FBI. This is a man 每 Director Comey 每 who they loved. They said he was the greatest thing in the world, very honorable.§ \n※When he came out with the decision in July to not prosecute Mrs. Clinton, they suddenly turned against him. He knows that if he makes any misstep, the Republicans are going to be all over him and they＊re going to try and bring harm to him. The thing that he did say in our hearing, and it stuck with me, is that ＆there should not be a double standard to the disadvantage of Mrs. Clinton.'§ \nCummings is heavily implying that the FBI Director was so intimidated by Congressional Republicans and the threat of being dragged in front of a Congressional investigation committee himself that he caved in and fed them the kind of vaguely worded red meat memo the Trump campaign desperately needed to keep their failing campaign on life support. \nEven Comey himself admitted that his memo was going to be widely misinterpreted , which is probably why CNN＊s host began her interview with Congressman Cummings by saying, ※Trump is lying about the email probe.§ \nIt hasn＊t taken long for the roof to cave in on Comey＊s career anyway, as his obvious meddling in the election has drawn bipartisan complaints about illegal electioneering by the FBI Director, his former boss to condemn his actions and for the Senate minority leader Harry Reid to demand answers from the FBI about the Republican candidate＊s love affair with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Reid＊s point was not lost on the Congressman from Maryland who told CNN: \n※There has been a lot of information out there about Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort and the Russian government and alleged attempts to take over our election. Members of Congress have asked for months, for the FBI to provide us with information if Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort and any elements of the Russian government have any coordination or connection with each other.§ \n※They have not given us one syllable. So the question here is: Do we have a double standard here?§ \nOf course there＊s a double standard! \nThe FBI has a responsibility to keep certain things secret, and when it comes to partisan elections that responsibility is key to the ability of our electoral democracy＊s basic functioning. Newsweek＊s Kurt Eichenwald pointed out cogently that Republican George W. Bush was investigated by the FBI in 1996, prior to running for President. Yet, the Clinton White House didn＊t grab his FBI file and air all of the dirty laundry claiming a very partisan need for transparency during an election. Otherwise, the FBI could decide to influence every election in America, and over time the FBI would pick the elected officials to their liking. \nNothing can un-ring the bell that FBI Director Comey struck by letting loose his vague memo, but everyone can understand there is a sexist, partisan and blatant double standard at play by Republicans celebrating a vague memo, which only happened because an official sworn to be non-partisan decided he valued his political career more than the integrity of our electoral system. \nWatch it here:",

So let me assure you, there＊s an army of support out there right now for our candidates.§ \nThe comments resemble similar ones made by Donald Trump in August when the GOP nominee said ※Second Amendment people§ could take matters into their own hands if Clinton became president. \nSenator Burr also mentioned how proud he was to have crippled the effectiveness of the Supreme Court by delaying President Obama＊s appointment of Merrick Garland which itself has set a record for longest time after such an appointment without a hearing. \nIn the same talk, Burr bragged that he＊d support keeping the court in a state of permanent dysfunction by refusing any of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton＊s judicial appointments, including to the Supreme Court. \nIt＊s fast becoming apparent that Republicans merely used that piece of double-talk as the start of an existential attack on American-style democracy, which requires a reasonable opposition to cooperate and compromise in decisions for a functioning government for the betterment of the people. \nDouble talk from Republican Congressmen of this type has become all too commonplace, but with Senator Burr＊s lies to North Carolina voters, it＊s so bold that he even gave opposite quotations to local reporters versus those inside the beltway and thought he could get away with it. \nBurr both publicly distanced himself from Trump and at the very same time doubled down on supporting Trump after his tapes emerged revealing the Republican nominee＊s serial predilection for sex assault. \nNow that Richard Burr＊s deplorable tape has emerged, the Republican Senator is facing calls to resign his position in the Senate altogether. \nUnlike Trump, the North Carolina Republican has already issued an apology, but it remains to be seen whether that will have any saving grace for the vulnerable Republican, who is locked in a death heat with Democrat challenger Deborah Ross . \nIt is absolutely unacceptable that an elected member of the United States Senate would even make jokes about the political assassination of one of our nation＊s most dedicated public servants",

    "text": "Comments \nThe alt-right and other Trump supporters were flush with excitement yesterday as their online echo chamber resounded with stories that Hillary Clinton was about to be indicted on the basis of the newly discovered emails on Anthony Weiner＊s computer. Today, of course, we learned that this was nothing but a bold-faced lied. While many of the more obscure right -wing blogs named nothing but imaginary sources to support their outrageous claims , the most legitimate source of the false story was none other than Fox News. \nOn November 2 Fox News＊ Bret Baier claimed that, according to two anonymous sources within the FBI, the agency＊s investigation of Clinton would ※continue to likely an indictment.§ The very next day reality forced him to walk back those claims, which he called ※inartful,§ acknowledging that ※that＊s not the process.§ \nNonetheless, Baier did not entirely disavow his ruse of an imminent Clinton indictment, maintaining that ※there is confidence in the evidence.§ Given that Clinton＊s indictment has been impending for months in the right-wing universe one would think that these shameless schemers would have wised up to the fact that it＊s not going to happen 每 and for good reason . Instead, every time there is the slightest mention of Clinton＊s emails, no matter how vague and clearly inconsequential , the alt-right rumor mill kicks into overdrive on its vicious crusade to smear the potential first female president in any way possible. \nIn reality, there is absolutely nothing so far to suggest that there is anything incriminating in the most recent batch of Clinton emails, and it has become increasingly clear that FBI Director James Comey＊s announcement of the renewed investigation was nothing but a cynical and hypocritical political ploy. In part the announcement was designed to fuel a new Republican storyline that Clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is under federal investigation. The demagogues making these claims conveniently ignore the fact that Trump is under investigation in no fewer than 75 cases , including the rape of a 13 year-old girl. \nAnother disconcerting storyline in yesterday＊s firestorm of right-wing rumors is the political interference of Trump supporters in the FBI. If Baier＊s so-called anonymous sources really were FBI agents, it would represent yet another recent example of meddling in the presidential election by Trump supporters at the supposedly impartial agency. In any case, the endless lies and distortions of the right-wing pseudo-media, from Fox News down to the lowliest blog, are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people.",

    "text": "Comments \nA Catholic church in San Diego has taken Donald Trump＊s calls to demonize of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton a tad too literally. The Immaculate Conception Catholic Church was caught passing out flyers last week that told parishioners that voting Democratic was a sin, and would immediately damn them to the fires of hell. \nThis week, they＊ve gone even further, and declared that the lawyer, former First Lady, and lifelong public servant is in fact an agent of the ruinous dark lord of evil incarnate himself, Satan. \n※The devil does this through tactics outlined by Saul Alinsky with the outcome as Hillary Clinton stated ＆And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed,＊ to draw us away from God＊s teachings regarding the sanctity of life to those of the world and its prince!§ railed the flyer. \nPreviously, the flyers asserted that ※it is a mortal sin to vote Democrat ＃ immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell.§ \nThis, of course, is not the first time that Secretary Clinton has been compared to the despoiler of worlds. Former neurosurgeon and pyramid expert Ben Carson declared Hillary in league with the devil at the Republican National Convention . A recent poll of Florida Trump supporters found a staggering 40% of them believe that the former New York Senator is a literal demon . \nThe irrational and all-consuming hatred that the right-wing feels for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is astonishing, and the fact that this is an actual issue shows that either the American public schooling system is entirely failing to do its job, or that a fair segment of the American population has fallen to thirteenth-century radical Christian extremism. \nWhat＊s truly ironic is that if one were to rationally approach this from such a literalist perspective, it is quite obvious that the envious glutton, shameless thief, and unrepentant lecher Donald Trump is Sin Manifest and his supporters are worshiping a false prophet, placing their own souls in mortal danger as they are consumed in heresy. \nBut since those are fairytales designed to maintain social control over an illiterate pre-industrial peasant populace, it＊s hard to explain this phenomenon without concluding that they may all just be idiots. Forgive me, but at this point my patience with these people is running very thin.",

    "title": "An FBI Agent Just Admitted His Bosses Are Pro-Trump, Hate ※Antichrist§ Hillary",
    "text": "Comments \nNumerous FBI officials, both current and former, say the Bureau is intentionally attempting to influence the presidential election in favor of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by damaging the candidacy of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \nThe interworkings of the FBI have been generously described as ※chaotic§ since Director James Comey declined not to recommend Hillary Clinton face criminal charges over her private email server, and this is because, as one current FBI agent described, ※the FBI is Trumpland.§ \nThis is a view shared by numerous other agents , none of which would speak directly on the record for fear of both professional and personal reprisal. \nComey then turned about-face and wrote a vague letter to Congress to announce the FBI would soon begin the process of combing through new emails which it had recently discovered that were tied to Clinton by way of Anthony Weiner , a disgraced Democratic congressman and failed New York City mayoral candidate who happens to be married to Clinton＊s top aid, Huma Abedin. \nThe FBI looked at Weiner because of accusations that he had been having illicit sexual conversations with an underage g irl. Comey＊s letter was almost immediately leaked by Congressman and self-appointed Clinton inquisitor Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and the dominoes began to fall in Trump＊s favor. Clinton＊s polling numbers began to sink, and the negativity surrounding the allegations of various sex crimes committed by Trump began to dissipate as the nation＊s perpetually wandering attention returned to the ersatz email ※controversy＊. \nOne FBI agent said that Clinton is viewed as ※the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel§ which is why the information about Clinton has been timed to coincide with the election, ※they＊re pro-Trump.§ \nHowever, not all of the information coming out of the FBI is entirely anti-Clinton. Trump＊s former campaign manager and former Putinist operative Paul Manafort, is also said to have an active investigation open against him and that the investigation is in its early stages. \nA former FBI official has a different take on the matter and said, ※There are lots of people who don＊t think Trump is qualified, but also believe Clinton is corrupt. What you hear a lot is that it＊s a bad choice, between an incompetent and a corrupt politician.§ \nThe content of the newly discovered emails, if they even exist at all, are unknown as Comey wrote his letter to Congress before the FBI acquired a warrant to read the emails. This is further evidence of the FBI＊s bias against Clinton as the FBI exists to investigate facts rather than spreading propagandistic rumor 〞 particularly weeks before a presidential election which many have said is a clear violation of the Hatch Act which was enacted to prevent individuals like Comey from using the power of their office to engage in partisan political activities. \nRudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City, hinted towards these actions by the FBI against Clinton two days before they transpired . He said, ※I think he＊s (Trump) got a surprise or two that you＊re going to hear about in the next few days. I mean, I＊m talking about some pretty big surprises.§ Now would Giuliani know the FBI was going to write a vague letter which would shake up the presidential election unless the FBI had already decided to take the action and time the release of the letter specifically to damage Clinton? \nThe Director of the FBI is a position that can only be appointed by a sitting president, and the director is given a 10-year term. The concern is due to the FBI＊s bias against Clinton, and the likelihood of her victory, it would appear all but impossible that James Comey would be capable of fulfilling his duties. The president has the discretion to unilaterally fire an FBI Director. The Congressional Research Service found ※there are no statutory conditions on the President＊s authority to remove the FBI director.§ If Clinton is able to beat back the FBI＊s last-minute attempts to influence the election, it is all but assured that she will fire Comey on her first day in the Oval Office.

    "text": "Comments \nFamous techno musician Moby tore into Republican nominee Donald Trump today in an op-ed published in RollingStone magazine, tearing into the racist rabble-rouser with unrepentant fury. ※I＊m tired of being a mealy-mouthed, NPR-listening lefty who has to respect other people＊s opinions§ writes Moby. ※Trump is an actual sociopath.§ \nDistraught at the unrelenting vitriol being hurled at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Moby disparages the naivete with which he feels many voters are approaching the election. \nIf you have a 25-year-old who＊s a Jill Stein supporter but they were nine when Ralph Nader handed the presidency to George W. Bush, they don＊t know better. There are a lot of people who have lived in a relatively benign bubble, like young women who just assume that Roe v. Wade will always be the law of the land. I think that there＊s an innocence that is informing a lot of people＊s desire not to vote, or to vote for Jill Stein, but it＊s because they＊ve had eight years of Obama. And I think that that innocence is making some of them naive and delusional. \nHe then goes on to detail just why a Donald Trump presidency is enough of a threat for him to be so undiplomatic in his approach. \nI think there is something seriously broken inside him where he＊s an actual sociopath and on the spectrum pretty close to being a psychopath. He＊s done nothing to indicate that he＊s even capable of feeling empathy [for anyone] except for himself. \n[A Trump presidency would be] death by 1,000 Republican cuts. It basically gives the NRA the ability to write gun policy. It gives the coal industry and the oil industry the ability to write energy policy. It＊s handing the keys to people who want to advance policy measures that are just 〞 again, I try and be diplomatic, but they＊re trying to advance policy measures to protect their corporate interests or protect their personal interests but to the egregious detriment of our country. \nWith Trump, you get a belligerent racist who＊s most likely a sociopath [and] definitely a racist and misogynist with no governing experience. And with Hillary, you get an incredibly bright, progressive, strong, experienced legislator. There＊s no choice unless you＊re ignorant, delusional or racist. \nHe＊s absolutely right on that point. While the ※death by 1,000 Republican cuts§ is the threat posed by any Republican candidate for the Presidency, the figure of Donald Trump is a threat to our Republic as we know it, and there can be only one choice. \nI＊ve given more money to Democrats this cycle than I＊ve ever given in an election season. I＊ve done phone-banking, tweeted, Facebooked and Instagrammed, probably to my own personal detriment 〞 the detriment of my friendships [and] certainly the detriment of my professional life 每 but honestly, the results of this election are more important than most. I＊d rather lose fans and have a hand in trying to keep Donald Trump out of the White House than trying to protect a career. A career pales in comparison to the health and wellbeing of our country and our planet. \nWhat I learned a long time ago is if you＊re a public figure and you＊re opinionated and outspoken, people will hate you for it 〞 even if they agree with what you＊re saying. But it＊s really nice: I＊ve been doing this for a long time and at this point I just don＊t care. What＊s someone gonna do 〞 not buy my records? It＊s 2016, no one buys records anyway.",

    "text": "Comments \nAuthor George R. R. Martin＊s books inspired the hit HBO TV series Game of Thrones , and he＊s no stranger to political intrigues. Even the legendary fantasy writer Martin never imagined an American demagogue, who could blithely step on every third rail of American politics and survive in the race until the general election. But the man who wrote television＊s most hated character 每 Joffrey Baratheon 每 just took to his blog to explain definitively why Donald Trump will never be fit to sit on the Iron Throne be president. \nIn my lifetime, there has never been a presidential candidate more unfit to lead this nation. \nYou don＊t need to like Hillary. You don＊t need to listen to what Hillary says about Trump, or what I say about Trump. You just need to listen to Trump. If you can do that, and still consider voting for him＃ well＃ \nMartin＊s book ※Song of Fire and Ice§ inspired the hit TV series, which is loosely based on the War of The Roses , as the warring clans of Westeros fight for control of the Iron Throne. For much of the series, the throne has been captured by golden haired Joffrey Baratheon, whose endless list of offensive behaviors begins as a callous child, and continues through his disastrous reign. Like the fictional boy-king, Donald Trump loves to sit on fancy, throne-like chairs and using his family＊s wealth and influence to play at being king. \nThe author Martin described the highly unusual nature of this year＊s presidential election by zeroing in on the striking difference between negative advertisements for the two candidates. He shrewdly pointed out that Donald Trump＊s attack ads are standard political ad hominem affairs 每 lots of selective editing and bluster, no substance 每 while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton doesn＊t even create traditional attack ads. \nMartin＊s list of the many Clinton attack ads doubles as a fine reason that nobody in their right mind, should choose the Republican nominee for President this upcoming Tuesday, November 8th: \nHillary does not need to use the sort of hoary attack ads that Trump is using. She only needs to present him as he is, and let his own words condemn them. \nAnd they do. \nNo one has to accuse Trump of anything, he has laid it all out there in public for the world to see. \nYes, he mocked a disabled reporter. There he is, doing it. \nYes, he told Billy Bush he liked to kiss women without their consent and grab them by their pussies. There he is, boasting about it. When you＊re a star, you can do anything. \nNo need to accuse Trump of going into the dressing rooms of Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA pagaents when the contestants were changing so he could see them naked. There＊s Trump himself, telling Howard Stern about it. \nYes, he said women should be punished for having abortions. There he is, telling Chris Matthews. His own words, his own face. \nYes, he said he wants to ban all Muslims from entering the US. Here, see the clip. \nYes, he＊s in favor of Japan and Saudi Arabia and South Korea having nukes, here＊s the clip where he says so. \nAnd on and on and on and on. The Gold Star family, the bad hombres, Judge Curiel, the Miss Universe contestant＃ his own speeches, his own tweets, his own words. \nMartin even remarked that for a man whose campaign resembles a nastier version of George Wallace, it is eerily starting to look like his braggadocious claim was correct, when in January, Trump said he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue in New York and get away with it. If there＊s any one moment in the Republican＊s campaign that could be described as Joffrey-esqe, that was the one, where like the fictional, twisted boy king , Donald Trump reveled openly in a threat to kill senselessly, and kill with impunity. \nThe dastardly character Joffrey＊s Uncle described him in a way that anyone watching Donald Trump might describe the oddly coiffed Republican candidate, ※We＊ve had vicious kings, and we＊ve had idiot kings, but I don＊t think we＊ve ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king!§ \nThe same harsh words equally apply to Republican nominee Donald Trump＊s disastrous fall as the standard bearer of his failed party, the GOP. \nWe agree with George R. R. Martin, all any voter needs to do is listen rationally to the irrational Trump speak, and realize that he＊s not Presidential material, and has a personality only fit to be an erratic boy-king, and certainly never to sit in the chair behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. \nWatch a hilarious mashup here:",

    "text": "written by Admin Eric Zuesse \nSee this screen-shot taken at 1:30 in the afternoon on November 9th, after Trump＊s win. They pretend Trump＊s win is a victory for bigots, instead of a defeat for the aristocracy (＆Wall Street＊, ＆The Establishment＊, or America＊s billionaires and their agents such as lobbyists and the leading politicians). \nHowever, a close look at the evidence shows Huffington Post to be wrong: Trump＊s win was overwhelmingly driven by Americans＊ repudiation of the aristocracy itself (such as, for example, repudiation of the Institute that runs Huffington Post＊s neoconservative international edition, World Post , the Berggruen Institute (including Eric Schmidt , Lawrence Summers , Fareed Zakaria , Arianna Huffington, Nicholas Berggruen , Ernesto Zedillo , Carl Bildt, Niall Ferguson, and Joseph Nye, all being proponents of Obama＊s building war against Russia 〞 such as: ※To confront Putin, Europe will have to make changes that will be deeply controversial on a continent long committed to environmentalism and marked by an aversion to the use of force§). And, as far as global warming is concerned, which is a real problem about Trump, it＊s also very much and demonstrably 〞 not merely in words 〞 a real problem about Hillary too (and one that back in July 2015 before the Party nominees had been chosen, even was courageously reported by some of HuffPo＊s own reporters ), but HuffPo and other Democratic Party propagandists pretend there＊s reason to believe that Trump＊s actions would be even worse than hers have been, and HuffPo＊s readers thus end up being little else than Democratic Party suckers who feel satisfied in their ＆news＊ reading to soak up what is almost entirely Democratic Party propaganda, which means the propaganda emanating out of the White House whenever a Democrat resides there 〞 sort of like a Democratic Party version of the Republican Party＊s Fox ＆News＊. \nThe aristocracy (all of it, both its Republican and its Democratic Party branches) continue their campaign, and expect to crush their opposition 〞 the public (of all parties). And that＊s what a close look at the evidence shows explains Trump＊s win 〞 not bigotry on the part of the American public. Bigotry is a huge problem in every society, but especially amongst the aristocracy, who love to pretend that it＊s mainly a problem ＆down below＊ 〞 so that they can continue to exploit the public while claiming to be superior to it.

    "title": "Hillary Clinton is Playing With Thermonuclear Fire, and You Will be Glowing",
    "text": "License DMCA I would never vote for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, and therefore have no dog in this fight. That said, I am an interested spectator, and clearly see that Ms. Clinton is playing a very dangerous game by using the Russians as an election issue and blaming them for everything. When asked about her leaked e-mails in the last debate, she skillfully avoided the damaging content of the e-mails, and turned the table on the Russians, claiming they are the danger. She argued we should all be alarmed at the attempt by Russia to manipulate our election, a charge which is totally untrue, and without any evidence. The leaked DNC e-mails clearly show that she and the DNC, not Russia, were successful in manipulating the election to defraud Sanders. Ms. Clinton lied about US intelligence agencies. She lectured Trump, saying 17 intelligence agencies said the Russians were behind the Wikileaks release of DNC emails. That is a lie on several counts. First, 15 agencies never said a word about leaked e-mails. Only two said anything, and this is what they said: The hacks \"are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow -- the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europa and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\" Read it again. That's a far cry from saying the Russians did it, and here is the proof. To this day no one knows who leaked the e-mails to Wikileaks. No one. Clinton's using Russia as a political scapegoat is very dangerous. At a time when there is bad blood between the two thermonuclear powers, it is irresponsible, and demonstrates a callous lack of judgement to falsely accuse Russia of such a deed without the slightest bit of proof for purely political reasons. Provoking the Russians for political reasons speaks volumes about Ms. Clinton. Perhaps the moderator should have asked Ms. Clinton: Has the US ever attempted to influence another nations election, or have you Ms. Clinton, in your capacity, ever tried to influence another nations election? Trump, not a quick thinker, should have attacked Clinton, asking: Are these the same intelligence agencies that lied about WMD in Iraq resulting in over one million useless deaths? Another well founded accusation against her candidacy is her eagerness to make war. She supported the illegal war on Iraq which killed millions of innocents. She pushed and continues to push for the 15-year war in Afghanistan. She supported \"the surge\" in Afghanistan, a total failure. She assisted the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Honduras by supporting the military and a dictator. - Advertisement - She was the one of the primary architects of the Libyan debacle, which led to the bombing and total disintegration of Libya. It is now the leading terrorist breeding ground in Africa. It was Clinton who took on Cabinet members who argued against military intervention in Libya. She had her way. Result; utter disaster! Ms. Clinton never saw a war she did not want to avoid. But now she is playing with fire. Russia has made it clear that they will not tolerate another Iraq in Syria. They will support the Assad regime and not allow the US to overthrow yet another Middle Eastern government. Russia insists the US is intentionally trying to promote anarchy in Syria by destroying the country, maintaining brutal sanctions that only harm innocents, and giving \"moderates\" heavy weapons to help bring down Assad. Russia has drawn a line in the sand, and Ms. Clinton is showing a severe lack of judgment in provoking and blaming them for all that ails the world. She has even compared Putin to Hitler, which historically, is tantamount to declaring war. Manuel Noriega was called Hitler, Saddam Hussein was called Hitler, Muammar Gaddafi was called Hitler. The pattern is clear. Vilify the enemy and attack. Ms. Clinton, we are told, is intelligent. Her actions indicate she is either stupid, or she has no sense of sane judgment, or both. She has called for a No-Fly Zone in Syria, which General Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, would mean war with Russia and Syria. As Secretary of State Ms. Clinton's job was to maintain peace, not start a war. She was not interested in peace as Secretary of State, but did start wars, and added fuel to the many we are currently fighting. She compared Putin to Hilter. No respectable Secretary of State, the nation's chief diplomat, would call another world leader Hitler. Nor does the Chief Diplomat look for and argue for war, by shouting down all who wished to avoid war in Libya. What is even more alarming is that mainstream media has followed their leader, Ms. Clinton, in demonizing Russia. The press has lost its way and is merely an echo chamber for Ms. Clinton and her neocon supporters who are vengeful, militaristic, and bombastic. - Advertisement - In conclusion, take note of those who have rallied to her cause. Numerous war mongers from the past. They smell war, and like the smell of death. They want to escalate the conflict with Russia. Over 50 of those who brought you the War in Iraq, have pledged their fealty to the Warrior Queen. Her past war record, combined with a complete lack of judgment, and surrounding herself with war crazy neocons, make a recipe for thermonuclear war. Of course, MSM has kept the public totally in the dark about the impending day of doom, and most don't even see it coming. As a spectator, and one who would like to avoid a nuclear confrontation with Russia, I now maintain Clinton is far more dangerous to the world's future than Trump, even though he is woefully unfit. Thankfully there is a sane alternative candidate.",

    "text": "(30 fans) - Advertisement - \nThis article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com . To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here . \nDonald Trump has long campaigned on the promise of running the country the way he's run his businesses. On that basis, we essentially already know what it would mean if he entered the Oval Office and applied his personal business acumen to this nation (and the rest of the world). There's a surprisingly full record to cite. Who can forget, for instance, what happened to his signature gambling resorts in Atlantic City? Who can forget their serial failures in what was still relatively good times in that city, including the repeated trips to bankruptcy court and the way he stiffed local contractors and suppliers, running them out of business? As Russ Buettner and Charles Bagli of the New York Times summed it up : \"He put up little of his own money, shifted personal debts to the casinos and collected millions of dollars in salary, bonuses, and other payments. The burden of his failures fell on investors and others who had bet on his business acumen.\" \nIn his pre-political years, he perfected what Kurt Eichenwald of Newsweek dubbed \"the art of the bad deal\": \"lost contracts, bankruptcies, defaults, deceptions, and indifference to investors.\" And from every bad deal for those who supported him, he's almost always walked away better off. All in all, it's quite a record (and don't even mention Trumped Up University ). There is no reason to believe that this pattern of behavior would change in the White House. After all, The Donald's record shows a remarkable consistency, so it's possible to imagine with a fair degree of accuracy what you're going to get. \nTake election night 2012 when The Donald was still a Mitt Romney supporter. CNN recently reported on his tweets that night and judging by his comment on the Chinese invention of climate change, his complaints about polling violations, his outburst about \"sham\" elections, and in the wake of Romney's loss his call for \"revolution,\" there hasn't been much truly new under the Trumpian sun in 2016 -- not even his last tweet of that night four years ago: \"We have to make America great again!\" In other words, his record should be considered remarkably predictive. So count on this: from the Oval Office, he'll walk away a richer man, leaving the rest of us holding the bag, and his supporters, particularly white working class men, in a striking version of hell. \nThen, of course, there's the other candidate. You know who -- the woman who never saw a bank CEO she couldn't get a couple of hundred thousand dollars from for giving thoroughly unsurprising speeches. Today, TomDispatch regular Nomi Prins, author of All the Presidents' Bankers , explores what our world might be like if The Donald goes down in flames and Hillary Clinton enters the White House next January. Consider this, economically speaking, the definition of a hold-onto-your-hats election, no matter who wins. Tom \nWaking Up in Hillary Clinton's America Wall Street in the Saddle By Nomi Prins \nAs this endless election limps toward its last days, while spiraling into a bizarre duel over vote-rigging accusations, a deep sigh is undoubtedly in order. The entire process has been an emotionally draining, frustration-inducing, rage-inflaming spectacle of repellent form over shallow substance. For many, the third debate evoked fatigue. More worrying, there was again no discussion of how to prevent another financial crisis, an ominous possibility in the next presidency, whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton enters the Oval Office -- given that nothing fundamental has been altered when it comes to Wall Street's practices and predation. \nAt the heart of American political consciousness right now lies a soul-crushing reality for millions of distraught Americans: the choices for president couldn't be feebler or more disappointing. On the one hand, we have a petulant, vocabulary-challenged man-boar of a billionaire, who hasn't paid his taxes, has regularly left those supporting him holding the bag , and seems like a ludicrous composite of every bad trait in every bad date any woman has ever had. On the other hand, we're offered a walking photo-op for and well-paid speechmaker to Wall-Street CEOs, a one-woman money-raising machine from the 1% of the 1%, who, despite a folksiness that couldn't look more rehearsed, has methodically outplayed her opponent. - Advertisement - \nWith less than two weeks to go before E-day -- despite the Trumptilian upheaval of the last year -- the high probability of a Clinton win means the establishment remains intact. When we awaken on November 9th, it will undoubtedly be dawn in Hillary Clinton's America and that potentially means four years of an economic dystopia that will (as would Donald Trump's version of the same) leave many Americans rightfully anxious about their economic futures. \nNone of the three presidential debates suggested that either candidate would have the ability (or desire) to confront Wall Street from the Oval Office. In the second and third debates, in case you missed them, Hillary didn't even mention the Glass-Steagall Act, too big to fail, or Wall Street. While in the first debate, the subject of Wall Street only came up after she disparaged the tax policies of \" Trumped-up, trickle down economics \" (or, as I like to call it, the Trumpledown economics of giving tax and financial benefits to the rich and to corporations). \nIn this election, Hillary has crafted her talking points regarding the causes of the last financial crisis as weapons against Trump, but they hardly begin to tell the real story of what happened to the American economy. The meltdown of 2007-2008 was not mainly due to \"tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy\" or a \"failure to invest in the middle class,\" two subjects she has repeatedly highlighted to slam the Republicans and their candidate. It was a byproduct of the destruction of the regulations that opened the way for a too-big-to-fail framework to thrive. Under the presidency of Bill Clinton, Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era act that once separated people's bank deposits and loans from any kind of risky bets or other similar actions in which banks might engage, was repealed under the Financial Modernization Act of 1999. In addition, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was passed, which allowed Wall Street to concoct devastating unregulated side bets on what became the subprime crisis. \nGiven that the people involved with those choices are still around and some are still advising (or in the case of one former president living with) Hillary Clinton, it's reasonable to imagine that, in January 2017, she'll launch the third term of Bill Clinton when it comes to financial policy, banks, and the economy. Only now, the stakes are even higher, the banks larger, and their impunity still remarkably unchallenged. \nConsider President Obama's current treasury secretary, Jack Lew. It was Hillary who hit the Clinton Rolodex to bring him back to Washington. Lew first entered Bill Clinton's White House in 1993 as special assistant to the president. Between his stints working for Clinton and Obama, he made his way into the private sector and eventually to Wall Street -- as so many of his predecessors had done and successors would do. He scored a leadership role with Citigroup during the time that Bill Clinton's former Treasury Secretary (and former Goldman Sachs co-Chairman ) Robert Rubin was on its board of directors. In 2009 , Hillary selected him to be her deputy secretary of state. - Advertisement - \nLew is hardly the only example of the busy revolving door to power that led from the Clinton administration to the Obama administration via Wall Street (or activities connected to it). Bill Clinton's Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs , Timothy Geithner worked with Robert Rubin, later championed Wall Street as president and CEO of the New York Federal Reserve while Hillary was senator from New York (representing Wall Street), and then became Obama's first treasury secretary while Hillary was secretary of state . \nOne possible contender for treasury secretary in a new Clinton administration would be Bill Clinton's Under Secretary of Domestic Finance and Obama's Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, Gary Gensler (who was -- I'm sure you won't be shocked -- a Goldman Sachs partner before entering public service). These, then, are typical inhabitants of the Clinton inner circle and of the political-financial corridors of power. Their thinking, like Hillary's, meshes well with support for the status quo in the banking system, even if, like her, they are willing on occasion to admonish it for its \"mistakes.\" \nThis thru-line of personnel in and out of Clinton World is dangerous for most of the rest of us, because behind all the \"talking heads\" and genuinely amusing Saturday Night Live skits about this bizarre election lie certain crucial issues that will have to be dealt with: decisions about climate change, foreign wars, student-loan unaffordability, rising income inequality , declining social mobility , and, yes, the threat of another financial crisis. And keep in mind that such a future economic meltdown isn't an absurdly long-shot possibility. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve, the nation's main bank regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , the government entity that insures our bank deposits, collectively noted that seven of our biggest eight banks -- Citigroup was the exception -- still have inadequate emergency plans in the event of another financial crisis.",

    "title": "Hillary, The Political Scientist",
    "text": "Happy Birthday, Hillary. You were destined to great things. And you knew it. *** I am astounded . I graduated in political science from the University of Naples, the university of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Giambattista Vico, and Benedetto Croce, in something like the 750 th graduating class; I have tried to keep up with the field as much as I could, even though I have preferred to concentrate on economics and political economy. I have always gotten along with the assumption that politics is \"the art of the possible.\" But, let us give a good look at it. What is in this formula, if not a put down; a downgrading, so downgrading, characterization of this noble science? No wonder politics has become the art of bickering; the art of discord; the art of grasping at reefs, while we are drowning in perilous waters. No wonder, politics in the United States and much around the world has become polarized between two factions that fight for supremacy to the death. Not the death of the political class, but to the psychological and physical death of millions of people--in this country, the richest of the countries, the last best hope for mankind. Let alone the millions overseas. No wonder both the right and the left are focused on this set of policies: \"Deny them their rights; take their dignity away; give them a warm soup in a cold winter night; and go to sleep in peace.\" What to say of this debasement of charity? What to say of this debasement of high morality? What to say of this debasement of politics? And there I was the other night, hearing and seeing the following words written on the screen of CNN, in their documentary on Hillary Clinton: - Advertisement - \"Politics is not the art of the possible\" politics is the art of making the impossible\" possible.\" These are the words, not of Hillary of today or yesterday. These are the words of a young woman who breaks with tradition at the stodgy prestigious Wellesley College and becomes the first valedictorian in the history of that college. This is Hillary who is called to lead her class, not via invitation by academicians or administrators at Wellesley, but by her classmates who recognized the force of her leadership. This is Hillary Rodham, later to become Clinton, who throws away her prepared speech and delivers her oration extemporaneously: \"Politics is not the art of the possible\" politics is the art of making the impossible\" possible.\" This is Hillary who is immediately recognized in the national press as a force of nature: woman's nature. This is a woman who could have been researching and writing and talking about political science for a lifetime. - Advertisement - This is a woman who could have climbed the rungs of academia with grace and ease. Instead\" She preferred to practice what she had discovered at such a young age. She rolled up her sleeves and went to work to make it possible for children to have a better life than the one to which they were clearly doomed by a society in thrall of control and scarcity and fear .",

    "title": "Why Donald Trump is not as horrible as Hillary Clinton \" and why you should vote for Jill Stein.",
    "text": "OpEdNews Op Eds 10/28/2016 at 12:50:20 Why Donald Trump is not as horrible as Hillary Clinton \" and why you should vote for Jill Stein. Permalink (Page 1 of 2 pages) License DMCA \nI could have named this article \"Damage Control\" -- because it essentially is about that, related to the lobotomizing dilemma of \"lesser evil voting\". \nBut let me be clear at the outset. I have already voted for Jill Stein . I had no other choice. I am firm in my conviction that to vote for sociopathic, narcissistic, self-serving, ruthless, guileful corporatists is an unconscionable act and a major crime against my country, irrespective of the convoluted rationalization which might attempt to justify it. \nNow let me offer reasoning that goes beyond my \"morally pure\" posturing. \nThe accepted wisdom is that a vote for Jill Stein is a vote for Donald Trump. This analysis purports that anyone voting for Stein would likely be a former Clinton supporter, and such a vote would subtract from Clinton's total. \nEven though Hillary's elitist, warmongering, anti-democratic, demonstrably criminal world view is diametrically the opposite of Jill Stein's, and I can't imagine anyone who's moved by the Green Party's agenda for the briefest moment being fooled by Clinton's phony populism, for argument's sake I'll accept this proposition. \nWhile I consider both Trump and Clinton to be equally unfit for office, I do not for a moment believe they would be equally ineffective. - Advertisement - \nHillary has for good reason become the choice of the oligarchs, the MIC, the bankers, the media, the people who actually run the country. She will serve them well. She knows her way around the system -- she's been gaming it most of her adult life -- and has all the right connections. Which is why even many prominent Republicans have joined the feeding frenzy and flocked to her like vultures over fresh kill. \nHillary will continue her faux-populist bloviating to keep the stinky masses in line, while her closest allies, the rich and powerful, continue to loot the Treasury, hollow out what's left of the U.S. economy, and bankrupt the middle and lower classes. \nMuch to the delight of the neocon-infested Department of State, Department of Defense, security agencies, MIC, and media, Hillary will \"get tough\" with Russia and China, press the war on Syria and the rest of the Middle East , promote and spread more chaos, death, and destruction across the globe in pursuit of military conquest, ultimately world empire. It'll be good for business and pumping up the already inflated egos of the exceptionalists. \nOn the other hand, Trump will fall flat on his face. His trademark bull-in-a-china-shop approach to making deals has no chance of success in Washington DC. He has no support -- his own party has all but disowned him -- no connections, at least not the political ones necessary for promoting his agenda. Yes, the politicos drank his champagne and ate the food at his extravagant bashes. Who wouldn't? But they don't owe him anything. Nada! Trump's much heralded talents for making great deals will confront hostile Democrats, contemptuous Republicans -- a perhaps long-overdue bipartisanship -- closing ranks to isolate and defeat the outrageous and vulgar outsider who thought he could buy and muscle his way into political power. License DMCA - Advertisement - \nHe'll try to build his wall. When Congress gets done with it, it'll be a 200-foot white picket fence in Calexico . He'll attempt rapprochement with Russia. That will be sabotaged with a false flag attack, maybe dressing some disgruntled maquiladora workers as Russian infantry men and mounting an invasion on the U.S. -- probably in Calexico -- or by John McCain threatening to fall on a grenade or blow his brains out in the Senate chambers if America doesn't immediately nuke Moscow . \nDespite his self-proclaimed success in the business world, Trump simply does not know the rules of the game in Washington DC. Unless he \"fires\" everyone -- declaring martial law and sending all members of the legislature to a FEMA labor camp in Montana -- he will either be the most ineffective president in history or be impeached. Maybe both! \nIn a phrase, Donald Trump as president will do 'less damage'. \nAnyone who has read my recent writings knows that my greatest concern about a Hillary Clinton presidency is her truculent foreign policy . A decade ago, I might have believed that she was misguided. Now I realize -- as quite a number of others do -- that she is completely insane. She's become drunk on power, poisoned by surrounding herself with neocons and warmongering humanitarians , possessed by visions of herself as the Warrior Queen.",

    "text": "(7 fans) - Advertisement - \nHillary Clinton is very sincere and is committed to economy, employment, refugees, immigration and health reforms as a means of making lasting change in the US and in the world. Now we need to take concrete action and not waste time in rhetoric. Hillary Clinton is committed to build an infrastructure of education, employment, health care, small business, free press, electrical power, communications and transportation. Hillary Clinton has a deep commitment. She is active in our educational and development community, include her involvement with the government and with leaders. She played an important role in offering outreach to the people including women and children. We must vote for her. We should remember that the first condition for economic reforms is good leaders, and employment. Good leaders and employment opportunities are necessary not only for the economic growth but also for the security, physical well being and psychological comfort of the American citizens. US has always been demonstrated a decent and sustained growth rate because of a fully functioning democratic system. The pillars of the US democratic system include regular elections, peaceful transfer of power, American people's involvement in all development programs, and a reliable power among the states. This has enabled US to pursue a policy of economic liberalization, massive educational improvement and of providing a solid investment in a long-term perspective. Yes, US still suffers from unemployment, and faces challenges; these problems seem solvable soon. US needs to establish and implement long-term policies of economic growth. It should also create a well-organized and comprehensive development vision that all the political leaders should agree to follow. Making appropriate investments in our roads, electrification, and extension services would help considerably in improving Americans lives. Increasing investment in basic education and health care are important in ensuring that the poor participate meaningfully in the economic growth. A lack of education and health care hurts the poor today. And finally, President Hillary Clinton must focus on generating high rates of sustainable growth while ensuring that the benefits of that growth is spread to all parts of states. As we know, the solutions are the same everywhere, have a society based on equity and justice for everyone. - Advertisement - As we know, most countries do the opposite. Discrimination against women and children today is as bad as decades ago. It's always the issue of the privileged not caring, the poor get hurt and people of color and women especially get hurt the most. Thus, vote for Hillary Clinton, because the role of the leaders is more important and they can assist people's movements for economic growth. - Advertisement -",

    "text": "No-fly zone would \"require war with # Syria and # Russia \" -- top US general http:// on.rt.com/7q0t - Advertisement - 6:15 PM - 22 Sep 2016 \nPredictably, the Clinton (cash) machine has been relentless promoting Hillary's no-fly zone. Whenever cornered, the machine switches the narrative to Russian hacking of the DNC. Edward Snowden, who knows a thing or two about cyberwarfare, stresses there is no solid proof Russian intel hacked the Democratic/Clinton machine. And if they actually did it, the NSA would know. The fact the NSA is mum reveals this is no more than information war. Pass the missile launchers, please \nTrump seems to have been more on the money when he insisted how Hillary will be outsmarted -- as she already was in the past -- when dealing with President Putin, who she has demonized as Hitler. \nI have shown how Hillary will be prevented from launching WWIII because her no-fly zone is already implemented in Syria by Russia. And the Pentagon -- reflecting Dunford's comments -- knows it, no matter how emphatically soon-to-be-unemployed Pentagon head Ash Carter threatens \" consequences .\" \nThe Pentagon ranks Russia and China as the number one and two \"existential threats\" to US national security, in that order. And the US government reserves for itself the privilege of a nuclear \"first-strike\" -- which Hillary supports (but not Trump); this is part of the 2002 Full Spectrum Dominance doctrine.",

    "title": "The Director of the FBI Reopens the Hillary Case",
    "text": "License DMCA \nWord has reached me from Washington that the FBI has reopened the Hillary case of her violation of US National Security protocols, not because of the content of the new email releases, but because voter support for Trump seems to be overwhelming, while Hillary has cancelled appearances due to inability to muster a crowd. The popular vote leaves the FBI far out on the limb for its corrupt clearance of Hillary. The agency now has to redeem itself. \nI myself do not know what precisely to think. Having been at the top of the Washington hierarchy for a quarter century, I have seen many mistaken judgments. At one time I had subpoena power over the CIA and was able to inform President Reagan that the CIA had misled him. He took note and proceeded with his policy of ending the Cold War with the Soviets. On other issues I have been mistaken, because I assumed that there was more integrity in government than actually exists. \nHowever, FBI director Comey did not need to reopen the case against Hillary simply because some new incriminating emails appeared. Having dismissed the other incriminating evidence, these emails could have passed unremarked. \nThe problem for the FBI, which once was a trusted American institution, but no longer is, is that there is no longer any doubt that Donald Trump will win the popular vote for president of the United States. His appearances are so heavily attended that thousands are turned away by local fire/occupancy regulations. In contrast, Hillary has curtailed her appearances, because she doesn't draw more than 30 or 40 people. \nAmericans are sick to death of the corrupt Clintons and the corrupt American media. The Clintons are so completely bought-and-paid-for by the Oligarchy that they were able to outspend Hollywood on their daughter's wedding, dropping $3,000,000 on the event. - Advertisement - \nNevertheless, I don't underestimate the power of the Oligarchy. As Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury I experienced the Oligarchy's power. If I had not been backed by the President of the United States, I would have been destroyed. \nIndeed, the Oligarchy is still trying to destroy me. \nPossibly Trump, as his enemies allege, is just another fake, like Obama who misled the electorate. However, Trump attacks the Oligarchy so strongly that it is hard to believe that Trump isn't real. Trump is asking for a bullet like John F. Kennedy, like Robert Kennedy, like Martin Luther King, like George Wallace. \nIn Amerika, dissidents are exterminated. \nTrump is against voting machines over which he has no control. If there are no INDEPENDENT exit polls, Trump can easily be robbed of the election, as the Texas early voting scandal indicates, with the electronic machines assigning Trump votes to Hillary. The \"glitch\" doesn't assign any Hillary votes to Trump. - Advertisement - \nMy expectation is that, unless Trump's popular vote is so overwhelming, the electoral collage vote will be stolen. Because of the absence of any valid reporting by the presstitutes, I don't know what impact the orchestrated election of Hillary would have on the electorate. Possibly, Americans will break out of The Matrix and take to the streets. \nI believe that Hillary in the Oval Office would convince the Russians and the Chinese that their national survival requires a pre-emptive nuclear attack on the crazed, insane government of the United States, the complete narcissistic state that in the words of Hillary and Obama is \"the exceptional, indispensable country,\" empowered by History to impose its will on the world. This crazed American agenda is not something that Russia and China will accept. \nHere is Donald Trump speaking to Americans in words Americans have been waiting to hear. Notice that Trump doesn't need teleprompters. \nI do not agree with Trump on many issues, but the American people do. For me and for the world, the importance of Trump is the prospect of peace with Russia. Nuclear war makes every other problem irrelevant.",
