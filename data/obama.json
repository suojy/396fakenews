    "text": "Email For Republican politicians like Ohio Governor John Kasich who refused to get behind Donald J. Trump＃it turns out Trump was right＃he didn't need you. In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the ＆never Trumpers' from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten him＃ \nIt's easy to glance at Tuesday's popular vote 〞 which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 每 and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obama's 2012 totals in several Midwestern states 〞 Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin 〞 Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What's more, she far surpassed Obama's 2012 vote total in Florida, the country's biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. \nA review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the country's most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation's most critical battleground states. Let's look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren't yet final because not all precincts have reported. \nFLORIDA 〞 29 EVs 〞 98 percent reporting \nObama 2012: 4,235,270 \nClinton 2016: 4,485,745 TRENDING ON 100% Fed Up",

    "text": "64 SHARE President Obama has signed an Executive Order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on December 19th. (AP Photo / Dennis System) \nWASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) 〞 Following the results of Tuesday night's election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19 th . Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. \n※People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,§ Obama told reporters. ※Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.§ \nUnder the President's order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday's election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. \nNot surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the president's decision. \n※Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didn't allow that to happen. President Obama doesn't care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.§ \nThe president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. \n※We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.§ \nPaul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. \n※Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes , but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19 th . What the people are actually voting for are their states' electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.§ \nPolitical Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the President's Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. \n※[The electoral college] is a f〞king joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise . Everyone should have an equal vote, and that's just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. It's time to bring our system into the 21 st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.§ \nObama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. \n※We're going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,§ Obama said. ※Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasn't this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?§ Obama said. ※If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.§ \nIf you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19 th election , you can call the Obama administration's special election hotline at (785) 273-0325.

Their visa records vanished from Chicago's Indian consulate. It comes one week after the ABC 7 I-Team raised questions about how David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Rana obtained their foreign visas in the first place. \n\nThe case of the vanishing visa records has churned up diplomats from Mumbai to Michigan Avenue. India's foreign secretary Nirupama Rao told reporters overseas Wednesday that she wants answers from Chicago's Indian consulate about the records and visa documents that have disappeared, records that might show how two accused Chicago terrorists obtained permission to scout targets in India. \n\nTop officials of Chicago's India consulate wouldn't talk to the I-Team on camera last week when asked how terror suspects David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Rana obtained five-year, unlimited passage visas to India. \n\nAnd the consul general did not return calls Wednesday regarding the paperwork they used to process Headley and Rana's visas, which Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao announced Wednesday have disappeared. \n\nWednesday evening, the Chicago consul general emailed a statement to the I-Team that conflicted with government statements made in India. The brief statement read: \"We have not reported loss of any papers regarding issuance of visa to David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Rana Hussain. Relevant information concerning the issuance of visa to these persons is available with the Government of India\". \n\nIndia's counterpart to the FBI is looking into the visa application process as part of its probe into the 2008 Mumbai massacre. \n\nThe two Chicago suspects are accused of having roles in the assault. Rana was denied bond by a Chicago district judge Tuesday, despite family members and friends offering $1 million in cash and property. Rana has not been directly charged with the Mumbai attack that left 175 dead, but was linked to the assault in government court filings. \n\nHeadley, a Pakistan-born Chicagoan, is a convicted heroin dealer whose birth name was Daood Giliani. He changed his name to ease travel to India, according to federal prosecutors in Chicago and to avoid the required pre-visa background check by Indian authorities. \n\nSince the time Headley and Rani were processed, India's Chicago consulate office began contracting out visa requests to a private company called Travisa Outsourcing that on its website claims, \"We have revolutionized the way people get their visas.\" \n\nAnd the new visa processing was subject of a news conference last year. \n\n\"The advantages of outsourcing is the Travisa company, which is handling the outsourcing, has set up a call center,\" said Ashok Kumar Attri, consul general. \n\nForeign Secretary Rao said she is impressed with the cooperation the US has given to Indian investigators. Headley and Rana are not due back in court until January.\" \n\n\"Was Bernardine Dohrn the Mentor of Michelle Obama at Sidley Austin?  \nApril 22, 2008  \nBernardine Dohrn was at Sidley Austin a law firm in Chicago from From 1984 to 1988, Dohrn was employed by the law firm Sidley Austin, although her criminal record has prevented her from being admitted to either the New York or Illinois bar. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardine_Dohrn \n\nMichelle Obama graduated from Harvard Law School in 1988.

Who better at Sidley Austin to be mentor to the author of this Princeton thesis than Bernardine Dohrn who had been number 2 on the FBI most wanted list? \n\nBarack Obama was assigned to Michelle Obama in summer 1989. This may have reflected how few blacks there were at Sidley Austin, especially from Harvard Law School or the equivalent. Dohrn got her J.D. from University of Chicago Law School. Since she is a prof at Northwestern despite her background, we might infer she was very smart and understanding.

They entered the company offices and homes of some directors on Friday. \n\nPolice were looking for evidence of illegal gambling, distributing child pornography, and money laundering. Since the raid, Starnet officials say police just don't understand their business. \n\nThe search warrant details 18 months of police investigation. It traces a network of companies registered in American and Caribbean jurisdictions. \n\nThe warrant also identifies Vancouver as the centre of Starnet's operations, even though this is a grey under Canadian law. \n\nPolice note that Starnet's revenues grew dramatically in the past two years, from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software. The investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for Friday's raid and seizure of company materials. \n\nRCMP Constable Peter Thiessen says investigators left Starnet offices yesterday morning. He says, \"They spent the better part of three days going through the business. And as a result of that search the investigation is continuing, but no charges have been laid.\" Starnet's many investors were spooked by the raid. Share prices dropped almost 70-percent on Friday. However, the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation. Stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading. \n\nIn written statements, company CEO Mark Dohlen said the Wall Street Journal calls Starnet the leader in Internet gaming and entertainment. He says companies like his, those on the cutting edge, are often misunderstood. Yesterday, Starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business. It plans to focus more resources on gaming. \n\nThe Police investigation is expected to last for several more months.\" \n\n\"Super Serco bulldozes ahead  \nBy DAILY MAIL REPORTER UPDATED: 23:00 GMT, 1 September 2004 \nSERCO has come a long way since the 1960s when it ran the 'four-minute warning' system to alert the nation to a ballistic missile attack. \n\nToday its ㏒10.3bn order book is bigger than many countries' defence budgets.

They are an ideal way of developing solutions, procedures and plans rather than the focus being on decision making. Table Top Exercises These involve a realistic scenario and will follow a time line, either in real-time or with time jumps to concentrate on the more important areas. The participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness. Simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise. Table-top exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations. Command/Control Post Exercises These are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping. Ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations and using their communications and information systems [Feeling lucky, Punk?] . This could include a mix of locations and varying levels of technical simulation support. The Gold Standard system is flexible to allow the tempo and intensity to be adjusted to ensure maximum training benefit, or to fully test and evaluate the most important aspects of a plan. Such exercises also test information flow, communications, equipment, procedures, decision making and coordination. Live Exercises These can range from testing individual components of a system or organisation through to a full-scale rehearsal.

They are more complex and costly to organise and deliver but can be integrated with Command Post Exercises as part of a wider exercising package.\"  \n\n\"Christopher Rajendran Hyman CBE (born 5 July 1963 in Durban, South Africa)[1] was Chief Executive of Serco Group plc from 2002 to October 2013.[2] ＃ On graduation, he worked for Arthur Andersen.

In 2002, Hyman became chief executive. .. Hyman resigned from his role of Chief Executive of Serco on 25 October 2013 following allegations that Serco had overcharged government customers. .. He was [making a presentation to Serco shareholder, including British and Saudi governments] on the 47th floor of the World Trade Center [North Tower] at the time of the September 11 attacks in 2001.\" \n\n\"July 7, 2016 Developments in PKI occurred in the early 1970s at the British intelligence agency GCHQ , where James Ellis , Clifford Cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution.[ 19 ] However, as developments at GCHQ are highly classified, the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mid-1990s. \n\nThe public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in 1976 by Diffie, Hellman , Rivest, Shamir , and Adleman changed secure communications entirely. With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting. \n\nAssorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used. With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread, the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute. Commercial reasons alone (e.g., e-commerce, online access to proprietary databases from web browsers) were sufficient. Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol ('https' in Web URLs); it included key establishment, server authentication (prior to v3, one-way only), and so on. A PKI structure was thus created for Web users/sites wishing secure communications. \n\nVendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market, started companies (or new projects at existing companies), and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability. An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations (see ABA digital signature guidelines), and shortly thereafter, several U.S. states (Utah being the first in 1995) and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations. Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others. \n\nThe enacted laws and regulations differed, there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation, and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be. \n\nBy the first few years of the 21st century, the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly. Operating procedures (manual or automatic) were not easy to correctly design (nor even if so designed, to execute perfectly, which the engineering required). The standards that existed were insufficient. \n\nPKI vendors have found a market, but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid-1990s, and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated.[20] PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to, and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others. PKI has had the most success in government implementations; the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program.\"  \n\nBase One Technologies 每 Corporate Strategy 每 We are a Government Certified Women-Owned Business   \nWe practice Diversity Recruitment and Staffing for IT positions Base One was founded in 1994 by a women engineer who had made a career in technology research for many years.

Well, yesterday on PBS' Nevada Week In Review , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) was asked whether his goal was to move Obamacare to a single-payer system. His answer? ※Yes, yes. Absolutely, yes.§ The plan to undermine your health and sufficiency is so diabolical and disgusting, that many would simply refuse to believe such a thing. Well, there it is folks. They don't give a damn about you or your well-being and will do anything in their power to see that decisions about your health are made by them in the future.

    "text": "Dean James AMERICA'S FREEDOM FIGHTERS 每 \nLast week, the Pentagon issued a Defense Department directive that allows ※Department of Defense (D0D) personnel to carry firearms and employ deadly force while performing official duties.§ \nThe Defense Department has been working on changing the ※gun-free§ zones on domestic military basis for several years in light of the deadly shootings at military sites in recent years. \nMilitary.com reports that the directive ※also provides detailed guidance to the services for permitting soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guard personnel to carry privately owned firearms on DoD property.§ It authorizes ※commanders, 05 and above＃[to] grant permission to DoD personnel requesting to carry a privately owned firearm (concealed or open carry) on DoD property for a personal protection purpose not related to performance of an official duty or status.§ \nThe directive also makes clear that DoD will consider further changes to grant ※[standard] authorizations for other DoD personnel, who are trained in the scaled use of force or who have been previously qualified to use a government-issued firearm, to carry a firearm in the performance of official duties on DoD property.§ This would allow DoD with certain combat training to carry firearms without going through the additional step of making application with a commander. \nKim Smith at Conservative Tribune notes that the policy was a response to an NRA-backed provision in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act that required the Defense Department to allow more service members to carry firearms on base. \n※It is a good first step in that it recognizes personal protection is a valid issue for service members, but there are many roadblocks in the way of making that option available,§ NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told the Washington Free Beacon . \nThose wishing to apply for permission to carry a firearm must be at least 21 years old and meet all federal, state and local laws, the directive said. \nIt would appear that the Pentagon saw no problems with implementing a policy for which President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump ran on removing gun-free zones from military bases. On July 9, 2015, Breitbart News reported that Trump pledged to end the gun-free scenarios for U.S. troops by ※[mandating] that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases.§ \nThe immediate institution of this directive probably left President Barack Obama incensed, but he undoubtedly realized that there was nothing he could do to prevent its implementation in a couple of months anyway. And that's good news because it works to ensure the safety of our troops, which should always be a priority. \nLet us know what you think about this in the comments below! \nGod Bless.",

    "title": "Why Obama Will Win",
    "text": "Why Obama Will Win Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, August 2008 \nIt is time to get used to the idea that the next president of the United States will be black. Why will a nation we are so often assured is ※racist§ elect a black president? And will it make a difference? \nEver since Hillary Clinton dropped out of the race, the polls have reported consistently that Barack Obama will beat John McCain. The media love to tell us that whites say they support the black candidate and then vote for the white, but there is no reason for whites to lie in this campaign. Mr. Obama will not get a majority of the white vote but he will get enough to beat Mr. McCain. Why will so many whites vote for Mr. Obama? \nFirst, some support his policies. They want to end the war in Iraq, and they want the standard liberal program of socialized medicine, higher taxes, more handouts, and more government. There has always been a substantial minority of whites who vote this way, and they have a clear favorite in Mr. Obama. \nSecond, as many people have pointed out, an enormous number of whites think it is deeply virtuous to vote for a black〞not for an out-and-out race man such as Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton, but for an unthreatening, well-scrubbed black who speaks standard English and promises to ※bring us together.§ Even if they live sharply segregated lives, whites thrill to the language of ※coming together,§ and they adore blacks who don't act or sound black. \nFor many whites, voting for Mr. Obama will be an act of high patriotism. Electing him will prove America is not ※racist,§ and many whites believe that rising above ※racism§ is America's sacred calling. One must never underestimate the importance to whites of feeling virtuous. Most would rather lose a leg than be thought a ※bigot,§ and a vote for Obama is a painless way to burnish anti-racist credentials. \nThird, young whites will line up for Mr. Obama. They have been swallowing anti-white, multi-culti propaganda all their lives and have not knocked around enough to discover it is false. Some who know their parents will vote for Mr. McCain will make a special point of voting for Mr. Obama. Every new generation thinks it is cooler, hipper, and wiser than any generation that ever lived, and what could be cooler, hipper, or wiser than putting a black man in the White House? For many young whites, a vote for Mr. Obama will be a denial of every uncool, unhip, and especially every even faintly race-realist thing their parents ever said or did. \nFourth, although the country seems to have a collective memory of no more than two weeks, Americans think everything is ※historic.§ Whenever someone breaks an obscure record in professional baseball we are told history was made. If you ask someone why he waited in line all night to buy the first Apple iPhone he will tell you it's a ※historic§ product. Americans love anything that is ※historic,§ and for people who think a few more stolen bases are ※history§ right up there with the Battle of Lepanto, putting a black man in the White House will be the discovery of America, Pearl Harbor, and the Second Coming all rolled into one. Many whites will vote for Mr. Obama because they want to think they helped ※make history.§ \nThe media, which has its own grim reasons for supporting Mr. Obama, is mesmerized by the same prospect. Editors salivate at the thought of writing headlines like ※History is Made§ the day after the election, and some will lose all self-control and add an exclamation mark. The emphasis, of course, will be on Mr. Obama as the first black president, implying more to come. The media, which always subtly boost the Democrat, will be even more blatantly partisan this time, downplaying every blunder Mr. Obama makes and highlighting Mr. McCain's. \nFifth, many whites will vote for Mr. Obama〞or at least not vote for Mr. McCain〞because the Republicans have nominated the most stunningly unattractive candidate in years. Old and pock-marked, Mr. McCain is thoroughly disliked in the Senate for arrogance that he cannot even hide from voters when he is not speaking from notes. He has dismayed Republicans by promoting amnesty for illegals, and dismayed everyone else by saying America should stay in Iraq for 100 years if it takes that long to ※win.§ Mr. Obama therefore has the enormous advantage of running against an opponent that not even Republicans like. \nMr. Obama will also crush Mr. McCain in face-to-face debates. Mr. McCain cannot put an unscripted sentence together any better than George W. Bush can, and will come across as a thick-witted geezer. Mr. Obama, who is as glib as any politician, gives credence to H.L. Mencken's definition of democracy as ※rule by orators.§ \nBut what about America's storied ※racism§? Isn't America brimming with people who can't bear the thought of a black president? Americans have been numbed for decades by attractive television-blacks who read the news, forecast the weather, and tell us which brand of toothpaste to buy. Americans get a steady diet of heroic movie-blacks who outsmart and beat up white brutes, solve baffling technical problems, dispense sage advice, and save the world. Even the current Miss USA is black. There are millions of whites who do not want to live with blacks or have much to do with them, but would a black president be much different from nearly eight years of black secretaries of state? The march of blackness may be vaguely worrying to whites but they think there is nothing they can do about it and that they shouldn't even if they could. \nThe final reason why whites will vote for Mr. Obama is that the Republicans do not have the backbone to attack him in the only way that would work. If they were serious, they would fill the airways with Jeremiah Wright prancing and raving, along with the message: ※This is the man who married Mr. and Mrs. Obama, baptized their children, and whom Mr. Obama calls a ＆family member'.§ They would buy radio ads quoting Michelle Obama's thesis in which she says she will always be black first and American second. Mr. McCain has nothing like the stomach for a campaign like this. \nMany blacks probably think he has the stomach for considerably worse: 57 percent think Mr. Obama is in greater physical danger than any white politician, and many say they would have warned him not to run, for fear he would be killed. An assassination would certainly be a shattering event. There is no telling how many cities would go up in flames, and Third-World countries, which have followed the Obama nomination with unprecedented interest, would help make it the most widely reported killing in history. (I have just returned from a Muslim country in which everyone has heard of Mr. Obama and likes him, but most have never heard of John McCain.) Whatever gruesome fantasies blacks may be spinning, however, assassination has gone out of style in America, and white resistance〞such as it is〞is dependably nonviolent. Mr. Obama will be perfectly safe. \nIn any case, Mr. Obama will win far more white votes than he will lose because he is black. Whites who don't want a black president would not vote for a Democrat anyway. As for black voters, even nominal Republicans are said to be running for the doors, but strictly racial voting has always been fine for blacks. Not so for whites, of course. Just try telling your co-workers that you disagree with Mr. McCain but are voting for him because he is white. \nRacially conscious whites will be in a quandary in November. Even if Mr. McCain's policies are worse than Mr. Obama's should they vote for the white man〞one with an adopted Bangladeshi daughter and who long ago betrayed white interests? Even after years of being softened up with black heroes and figureheads, a black in the White House is a powerful symbol of white dispossession. A mulatto president is an almost explicit endorsement of miscegenation. This is bitter medicine. \nSome whites have argued that a black president would undercut the charges of ※racism§ whites are forever facing, but they are dreaming. The entire government could look like a meeting of the Mystic Knights of the Sea, but as long as blacks are worse off than whites we will be blamed for it. Sensible whites cannot cheerfully vote for either man; I suspect most will stay home or vote for a minor candidate. \nAside from the symbolic impact, which cannot be calculated, will President Obama be much different from a President Hillary Clinton? She would lard her cabinet with blacks and Hispanics, nominate ultra-liberal judges, push for amnesty, grovel before non-whites everywhere, and load up the ※civil rights§ division of the Justice Department with anti-white sharks. She would certainly make a bigger fool of herself over Hispanics and Asians (see ※ Turning Up the Pressure ,§ AR, May 2008). Our choice, therefore, could not be more disagreeable. On balance, we get to decide which is the more degrading spectacle: deluded white people giving their country away or clear-eyed blacks helping themselves to it. \nPresident Obama will, however, face special pressures. He can't let the pushier brothers walk all over him, but he will have to throw them enough bones to keep them off his back. It will be a tricky balance. Mr. Obama's first annual address to the NAACP will be a love feast, but every year after that it will be harder to explain why black unemployment, poverty, and incarceration rates haven't changed at all. \nEven Mr. Obama's star-struck white supporters will eventually wonder what happened to all that ※change§ he promised. There is not going to be change. The system is far too stuck in its self-serving ways for that. With the help of an enlarged Democratic majority in Congress, Mr. Obama may set up some wheezing, byzantine form of socialized medicine, but no one will be happy with it. If Mr. Obama inherits a sick economy, a weak dollar, expensive oil, and shrinking revenues, Americans will not at all like the change they get. \nOn the bright side, with Mr. Obama we have a good chance of piquant First-Lady behavior. What will the White House be like with Michelle in charge? Will she want a new exterior paint job? How and whom will she entertain? Will the Big Man's guest bedrooms〞in the African tradition〞be turned over to third cousins from Kenya and the South Side of Chicago? There is no telling with what improprieties large and small Mrs. Obama will entertain us as she makes up her mind whether she is an American. \nIt will be an edifying presidency; and whites may be a little less deluded in 2012.",

    "text": "Obama Admits to Rigged Elections back in 2008 10/27/2016 \nTRUTH REVOLT \nThere's a lot of accusations going around that the 2016 election is rigged. From Democrats suggesting Russia is tampering with the presidential election to a plethora of documents and undercover video that proves Democrats are trying their darnedest to sway the outcome. \nPresident Obama has laughed off the notion that Bernie Sanders was forced out by the DNC and believes Donald Trump is out of his mind for suggesting elections are rigged. And of course, Obama would never admit that Hillary Clinton could do something wrong. But candidate Obama, in 2008, sure was concerned that the election might be rigged against him. \nVideo of him answering a campaign question has surfaced to put to rest the notion that he doesn't believe in the possibility: \n※Well, I tell you what: it helps in Ohio that we've got Democrats in charge of the machines. [Cheering] But look, I come from Chicago, so I want to be honest, it's not as if it's just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past, sometimes Democrats have too.

Therefore we do not endorse political candidates either in primary or general elections. However, as defenders of America's social contract, we insist that the rules laid down by both parties at the outset of campaigns be respected, and that the results be decided by free elections. We will oppose any attempt to rig the system and deny voters of either party their constitutional right to elect candidates of their choice.",

    "text": "By: Arjun Walia via collective-evolution.com\nWikiLeaks just released their newest batch of leaked emails, and they contain messages sent to and from Barack Obama prior to his presidential inauguration.\nThe most interesting of the emails in this batch involves a message from John Podesta to Obama regarding an invitation from President George W. Bush to then ＆President-Elect'. It alluded to a transition plan that was being worked on before the election took place.\nAccording to the memo, Obama was already discussing his transition into office with the then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. Here is a statement taken from a memo sent from the transition board to Barack Obama:\nAs you have observed in your interactions with Secretary Paulson, he is apparently eager to involve you and your transition team extensively in his policy choices following the election.\nImmediately after the election Secretary Paulson and other members of the Administration will likely seek to involve you and your transition team in their ongoing policy responses to the financial and housing crises. We also expect relentless interest from the press and public about your intended level of engagement with the Administration on these matters during the transition.\nThink about this for a second, Obama's transition was already being discussed with certain members of the Bush administration. Also, judging by the email, it's clear that it was known that Obama was going to be the president.\nAnother telling email, dated October 30, 2008, came from John Podesta to the then Senator Obama discussing an economic transition team, and why Obama needed to get the wheels in motion before his term begins.",

    "text": "By Claire Bernish at thefreethoughtproject.com\nPresident Obama contemplated arming the already controversial ＆moderate' Syrian rebels weapons to ※defend themselves against Russian aircraft and artillery§ as his Plan B for Syria when all else failed in the effort to oust Assad 〞 but although this treacherous plan has been effectively shelved, it remains an option for whomever next ascends to the White House.\nAccording to a new report from the Washington Post , Obama's Plan B has neither been ※approved or rejected§ in the U.S.' disintegrating and increasingly complex campaign to depose Syrian President Bashar al Assad 〞 which has, of course, precipitated a perilous proxy war with staunch Syrian ally, Russia.\nSkepticism over allowing the CIA to provide various anti-Assad terrorists 〞 euphemistically termed moderate rebels by the U.S. 〞 with ※truck-mounted antiaircraft weapons that could help rebel units but would be difficult for a terrorist group to conceal and use against civilian aircraft§ apparently forced the plan to be tabled, the Post reports.\nIn the U.S. program to topple Assad, the CIA has armed and trained defectors from Syrian military known as the Free Syrian Army 〞 whose own defectors went on to form the Islamic State 〞 as well as other terroristic groups virtually indistinguishable from one another except for their political ideologies.\nThese issues factored into restrictions on weapons the U.S. would provide to their sponsored rebels; but, as the Post explains:\n※Rebels chafed at the restriction, complaining that it left them vulnerable to air attack by Assad and, more recently, Russia.§\nPlan B was envisaged as a compromise by the CIA.\nBut the complex state of affairs in Syria has led not only the FSA, but other ＆moderates,' to ＆radicalize' 〞 complicating U.S.' goals and frustrating Russian efforts to purge the embattled nation of terrorists. While the Pentagon's public goal has duly sought to wrest control from Assad and fight the Islamic State, the CIA program of arming rebels is widely considered counterproductive 〞 if not, perhaps, nefarious.\nPlan B, despite potentially devastating repercussions, retains stolid support from top officials, including unsurprisingly CIA Director John Brennan and Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter 〞 but has lost favor recently with former proponents, including Secretary of State John Kerry.\nKerry and other skeptics rightly grasp providing heavy artillery to rebels fighting Russia-backed Syrian government forces to down Russian aircraft 〞 which would undoubtedly turn the smoldering U.S. proxy battle into an all-out war with Russia.\nAdditionally, the Post reports, a growing number of U.S. officials feel the contentious CIA program has only proven to bedevil the ultimate goal of regime change, and, as one unnamed ＆senior official' noted, CIA units are ※not doing any better on the battlefield, they're up against a more formidable adversary, and they're increasingly dominated by extremists,§ adding, ※What has this program become, and how will history record this effort?§",

    "text": "Share This \nHow did the \"growing trust\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his \"working and personal relationship with President Obama \" change into today's deep distrust and saber-rattling? \nTheir relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the \"feverish\" state of international relations and lamented: \"My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.\" He complained about \"people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice\" and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a \"common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.\" \nA month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, \"My good friend John Kerry ＃ is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry's] assurances that the US commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief.\" \nDo not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire 每 not to mention statements at the time by the most senior US generals 每 were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia. \nRelations between the US and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft 每 including any stealth aircraft 每 over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft. \nIt seems possible that the US air force will challenge that claim in due course 每 perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, \"I wouldn't put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft ＃ if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground.\" \nInjecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia's warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a US or coalition aircraft. \nMeanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the US is contributing \"a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team\" as a \"major sign of the US commitment to strengthening deterrence here.\" \n\"This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,\" he explained, referring to NATO's July summit meeting in the Polish capital. \"The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany.\" \nOn Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the \"myth\" of a \"Russian military threat,\" calling this a \"profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets ＃ expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders.\" \nMyth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia's borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against \"saber-rattling,\" adding that, \"We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation.\" \nSpeaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two and a half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d'谷tat in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia's reaction in annexing Crimea. Americans malnourished on the diet served up by \"mainstream\" media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev, during which \"Yats\" (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington's choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev. \nThis unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, \"really the most blatant coup in history.\" \nIt's time for Western politicians and media to learn their lesson and pay attention to the statements coming out of Russia. Ask yourselves: Why all this hype now? \nRay McGovern, like Sam Adams, began a career as a CIA analyst under President Kennedy; working on Vietnam, they became close associates. Sam was too straight-arrow to go to the media about the unconscionable fraud regarding the number of Communist forces. Ray knew that and rationalized not doing so himself. So, while a close associate of Sam Adams years ago, Ray fell short of the standard set by the above awardees, who deserved to be honored by Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence. \nReprinted with the author's permission from the Baltimore Sun .

    "title": "The End of Obama's Term: A Report Card on Latin America",
    "text": "Share This \nAs the end of Obama's term in office approaches, it may be of interest to evaluate his performance on Latin America. One of Obama's foreign policy promises at the beginning of his first term was to change the way America does business with Latin America. \nThe promise to change the way America does business in its backyard was a significant one because the way America has played in its backyard has a long and consistently appalling history. The history of interference and regime change began early when President McKinley betrayed Cuba and stole it under the deceptive promise of liberating it from Spain. In 1903, Theodore Roosevelt severed Panama from Columbia, declared it an independent nation and put in power a government whose first act was to sign over the future Panama Canal. In a little discussed maneuver, the U.S. cooperated with the 1908 removal of Venezuelan President Juan Vicente G車mez. In 1909, President Taft removed Nicaragua's Jos谷 Santos Zelaya because he insisted that US companies in Nicaragua honor their agreements and tried to make his country less dependent on the US by borrowing from European, and not American, banks. \nIn the modern era, 1954 saw Eisenhower order the CIA overthrow of Guatemala's Jacobo Arbenz. In 1959-1960, Eisenhower would also start the covert action to remove Fidel Castro from Cuba. Kennedy would continue to rain \"the terrors of the earth\" on Cuba. He would also begin the Brazilian coup that would overthrow Goulart in 1964 and undertake a political action to encourage the removal of Cheddi Jagan from power in Guyana. In 1971, Nixon would brutalize Chile with the coup against Salvador Allende. President Omar Torrijos of Panama would die in a plane crash in 1981. In The New Confessions of an Economic Hit Man and in an interview with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now , John Perkins has claimed that Torrijos' plane crash was another US assassination. Though it has never been proven that Torrijos' death was a CIA assassination, there is some evidence that, at least earlier, consideration of his assassination was on the table. At the close of 1989, George H.W. Bush, in an unprovoked attack on the civilian population of a nation that had never threatened America, would take out Panama's Manuel Noriega. At the end of the last century and the beginning of this one, Jean-Bertrand Aristide was twice removed from power over the popular voice of Haitians. The Latin American coups would continue through George W. Bush's unpopular and short lived 2002 removal of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. \nSo, it is not unimportant to evaluate Obama's performance on his promise to change this tragic and shameful history. It's not unimportant, but it is unimpressive. \nIt didn't take long for the first indication that nothing had changed. On June 28, 2009, Honduras' democratically elected President, Manuel Zelaya, was seized at gunpoint, removed in a coup and whisked away in a plane that refueled at a US military base. \nAfter the coup, US support to the Honduran military only increased. The American ambassador was never recalled, and the US refused to join the call of the United Nation's General Assembly and the Organization of American States for the return of the elected President. Though the Organization of American States (OAS) refused to recognize the new coup president, the US State Department refused to join in that too. In fact, following an election that the OAS, the U.N. and others refused to recognize, the US would insist on recognizing the coup government as the victor of the election. \nBut, despite the refusal to call Zelaya's removal at gunpoint a coup, and despite recognizing the coup government as the legitimate government of Honduras, the Obama White House knew it was a coup. By July 24, 2009, less than a month after the coup, the White House was in receipt of a cable sent from the US embassy in Honduras. In an almost comic lack of subtlety that was clearly never meant to be public, the cable is called \"Open and Shut: the Case of the Honduran Coup\". In it, the embassy says \"There is no doubt that the military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup . . . .\" Their conclusions could not be clearer: the embassy explicitly calls it a \"coup\" and says that \"[t]here is no doubt\". And just in case there were any remaining objections, the cable adds that \". . . none of the . . . arguments [of the coup defenders] has any substantive validity under the Honduran constitution\". \nAt best, Obama cooperated with the coup by maintaining silence, though his administration was engaged in dialogue with the rebellious military up to the day of the coup, and by recognizing the coup government as the legitimate government of Honduras. Latin American expert Mark Weisbrot told me in a correspondence that \"the Obama administration acknowledged that they were talking to the [Honduran] military right up to the day of the coup, allegedly to convince them not to do it\". But, he added, \"I find it hard to believe that they couldn't convince them not to do it if they really wanted to: the Honduran military is pretty dependent on the US\" The charge was reiterated by Rodolfo Pastor Fasquelle , the minister of culture in the Zelaya government, who said on Democracy Now that \"I know for a fact that CIA operatives and military personnel of the United States were in direct contact with the conspirators of the coup d'谷tat and aided the conspirators of the coup d'谷tat.\" At worst, Obama was, as Zelaya has always insisted, involved in the coup. Zelaya claims that \"the coup came from the north form the US\" In the heat of the coup, the plane that was carrying the kidnapped president landed at the US military base of Palmerola for fifteen to twenty minutes while it refueled, despite the close proximity of its destination. After the coup, then Secretary of State Clinton has admitted that she aided the coup government by shoring up the coup government blocking the return of the elected government: \"In the subsequent days [after the coup] I spoke with my counterparts around the hemisphere, including Secretary [Patricia] Espinosa in Mexico. We strategized on a plan to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot.\" \nAfter the coup against Zelaya, Ecuador's popularly elected president, Rafael Correa, said, \"We have intelligence reports that say that after Zelaya, I'm next.\" He may have been right. \nThe year after the Honduran coup, there was an attempted coup on Correa. Although the action failed, Latin American expert Mark Weisbrot says it was clearly an attempted coup to overthrow the government of Rafael Correa. \nCorrrea had renegotiated oil contracts and demanded a bigger share of the big oil companies' revenue for the people of Ecuador. He also opposed a free trade agreement with the US and closed the US military base in Ecuador. He joined Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia and Ecuador in the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) and successfully defaulted on over $3 billion of foreign debt that was illegitimately contacted by Ecuadorian leaders Correa said were CIA supported dictators. \nPrior to Obama, the US had started action against Correa. An October 2005 embassy cable sent by US ambassador Linda Jewell outlined action for \"desirable political and economic change in Ecuador.\" In 2006, she cabled that a Correa election would \"derail\" US hopes as the embassy expects Correa to join Chavez and other nationalist South American leaders.\" In the same cable [06QUITO2150], Jewell said that the US has \"actively discouraged potential alliances\" with Correa. She admitted [06QUITO2991] to \"working in concert with other Ecuadorians and groups who share our vision.\" \nDuring the Obama years, the US would continue to intervene in Ecuador. In March 2009, Ecuador expelled Mark Sullivan, an American official whom they accused of being the CIA station chief in Quito and whom they accused of playing a role in the suspension of US assistance to a special investigative police unit when Ecuador named a new chief of whom the US didn't approve. \nOn October 30, 2010, the coup Correa had been expecting came. The coup leader was a graduate of the School of the Americas. A government appointed commission found that \"foreign actors\" had been involved in the coup. One of members of the commission announced his belief that the US State Department and the CIA had been involved. \nThe same year, Obama failed his next test. That year, America bankrolled the Haitian elections. The cost was 14 million dollars: a price tag that presumably gave America some say. But Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) banned fourteen parties from running in the election. The CEP was handpicked by the ruling party in a process that is not recognized by Haiti's constitution. \nFanmi Lavalas, the party of Jean Bertrand Aristide, who was twice removed in US sponsored coups, is the largest and the most popular party in Haiti. It has won every election it has been allowed to participate in. That it has been allowed to participate in, that is. But in this US backed election, Fanmi Lavalas was not allowed to participate: it was banned by the CEP. \nThe US and its allies continued to influence the Haitian elections when they supported a runoff between two unpopular candidates representing essentially the same side. But the second round runoff between the two candidates was illegal because the CEP never accomplished the number of votes to ratify the first round results that selected them. \nThe Obama administration financed the election that specifically excluded the party the people wanted to elect. And, in doing so, Obama broke his foreign policy promise to Latin America and very quietly continued to do business with Latin America in the same interventionist way the US had always done business with Latin America. \nThe next indicator of a failing grade came in Paraguay, where in June 2012, Fernando Lugo, the democratically elected leader of Paraguay was removed in a coup. The right wing opposition opportunistically capitalized on a skirmish over disputed land that left at least eleven people dead to unfairly blame the deaths on President Lugo. It then impeached him after giving him only twenty-four hours to prepare his defense and only two hours to deliver it. The Latin American organizations Unasur and Mercosur suspended the new Paraguayan government; the US spent coup day negotiating a new military base in Paraguay. As in Honduras, they never used the word ※coup§. \nBut they could have used the word if they hadn't wanted to support the coup with their silence. As early as 2009, US embassy cables say that Lugo's political opposition has as its goal to \"Capitalize on any Lugo missteps\" and to \"impeach Lugo and assure their own political supremacy\". The cable notes that to achieve their goal, they are willing to \"legally\" impeach Lugo \"even if on spurious grounds\". Obama knew it was a coup: the US had been tipped off about the strategy and told what it would look like. \nThe next year, 2013, the interference moved to Venezuela. Against the wishes of the United States, Hugo Chavez' successor, Nicol芍s Maduro, won the right to continue the Bolivarian Revolution by winning the next national election. America was the only country in the world to refuse to recognize the election results , though 150 electoral monitors from around the world monitored Venezuela's election, including delegations from the Union of South American Nations and the Carter Center. \nTwo years later, in 2015, the Obama administration again became involved in Venezuela. Contrary to Obama's promise, business went on as usual with American money being pumped into Venezuela to fund groups who oppose Maduro. Since 2000, $90 million has poured into Venezuela. That sort of interference in Venezuela is not suggestive of a new way of doing business in Latin America. In 2015, that US funded opposition once again attempted to pull off a coup in Venezuela. Maduro explicitly accused the Americans of, as in 2002, being involved. \nThe accusation is not an empty one. Venezuelan officials have produced a significant volume of evidence that the events constitute a failed coup and that the US was involved. They have produced a recording of a communique that was to be issued after the Maduro government was removed from power. They have shown confessions by military officials. And they have admitted as evidence a recorded phone conversation between opposition leaders discussing the coup. The day before the planned coup, Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, who is known to have made phone calls to a US number, Leopoldo Lopez and Maria Corina Machado, both major opposition leader of last year's attempt to remove Maduro from power 每 an attempt that they made clear was an attempted coup by saying that they would not to stop until they ※ got rid of Maduro \" 每 signed a National Transition Agreement. Weapons were also found in the office of the opposition party. \nLucas Koerner of Venezuelanalysis.com adds that the aircraft to be used as part of the failed coup has links to the notorious American security firm Academi (formerly Blackwater). And it has been reported that a number of the coup leaders obtained US visas from the American embassy to facilitate escape should the coup fail. \nAnd, just this past May, President Maduro has declared a state of emergency, accusing the US of once again conspiring with right wing groups in Venezuela to overthrow his government. Maduro says that ※Washington is activating measures at the request of Venezuela's fascist right.§ \nIn perhaps his final chance to make good on his promise to do business with Latin America differently, Obama has, once again, disappointed by maintaining American silence on the coup in Brazil. How do we know that Obama should have spoken out against the take over of parliament by an unelected party? How do we know that it was a coup? Because the unelected party said so. Twice: both before the coup and after. \nThe publication of a transcript of the call between Romero Juc芍, who was a senator at the time of the call and is currently the planning minister in Michael Temer's new government, and former oil executive Sergio Machado, provides incontrovertible proof that the removal of the elected President was a coup. The phone call lays bare ※a national pact§ to remove Dilma and install Temer as President. Juc芍 reveals that, not only opposition politicians, but also the military and the Supreme Court are conspirators in the coup. Regarding the military's role, Juc芍 says, ※I am talking to the generals, the military commanders. They are fine with this, they said they will guarantee it.§ And, as for the Supreme Court, Glenn Greenwald reports that Juc芍 admits that he ※spoke with and secured the involvement of numerous justices on Brazil's Supreme Court.§ Juc芍 further boasted that ※there are only a small number§ of Supreme Court justices that he had not spoken to. \nSo confident is Michel Temer that he has US support for his coup that he is comfortable to openly boast about it in the US in front of an audience of business and foreign policy leaders. Temer clearly told his American audience that elected President Dilma Rousseff was not removed from power for \"violating fiscal laws by using loans from public banks to cover budget shortfalls, which artificially enhanced the budget surplus\" as the official charge stated. She was, the new, unelected President admitted, removed because of her refusal to implement a right wing economic plan that was inconsistent with the economic platform Brazilians elected her on. Temer's economic plan featured cuts to health, education and welfare spending as well as increased emphasis on privatization and deregulation. \nRousseff was not on board. So she was thrown overboard. In the words of Temer's comfortable confession : \nAnd many months ago, while I was still vice president, we released a document named ＆A Bridge to the Future' because we knew it would be impossible for the government to continue on that course. We suggested that the government should adopt the theses presented in that document called ＆A Bridge to the Future.' But, as that did not work out, the plan wasn't adopted and a process was established which culminated with me being installed as president of the republic. \nConfession. Cased closed. \nAnd just to remove any doubt that the coup government's motivation was not indignation at Rouseff's fiscal maneuver, one of the coup government's first acts of legislation was to explicitly legalize the very budgetary act they had impeached Rousseff for two days earlier. \nSo, once again, at best, Obama gets a low grade on his foreign policy promise for maintaining silence on what he knows to be a coup in Latin America. Silence is support. At worst, he gets a failing grade for cooperating with the coup. \nAmerican participation in the Brazilian coup has not been established. But, ※there is no doubt that the biggest players in this coup attempt 每 people like former presidential candidates Jos谷 Serra and A谷cio Neves 每 are US government allies,\" according to Latin American exert Mark Weisbrot. And Boaventura de Sousa Santos, Professor of Sociology at the University of Coimbra in Portugal and Distinguished Legal Scholar at the University of Wisconsin-Madison says that Brazil is awash in financing from American sources, including ※CIA-related organizations.§ \nThe very day after the impeachment vote, Senator Aloysio Nunes of the coup government began a three day visit to Washington . Nunes is a significant player in the coup government: he was the vice-presidential candidate on the 2014 ticket that lost to President Rousseff and a key player in the effort to impeach President Rousseff in the senate. Nunes scheduled meetings with, amongst others, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker and Ben Cardin, as well as with Undersecretary of State and former Ambassador to Brazil Thomas Shannon. Though Nunes denies it, there are reports that his trip to Washington was ordered by Michel Temer. The willingness to go ahead with the planned meetings with Nunes right after the impeachment vote demonstrates, once again, at least tacit acceptance or approval on the part of Washington. \nSo, Obama broke his promise. His foreign policy in Latin America may be more silent and more subtle, but the way he has done business with Latin America has not broken from the long line of Presidents who preceded him. At a rapid and consistent rate of almost one each year, Obama has done business as usual in America's backyard: 2009 in Honduras; 2010 in Haiti and, perhaps, Ecuador; 2012 in Paraguay; 2013 in Venezuela; 2015 in Venezuela again and 2016 in Brazil. \nTed Snider writes on analyzing patterns in US foreign policy and history.

    "text": "Email US President Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton ※founded§ the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group in the Middle East region, according to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Addressing supporters at a rally in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump said Daesh is \"honoring President Obama.\" ※He's the founder of ISIS. He's the founder! He founded ISIS,§ the real estate tycoon said, using an alternative acronym for the terrorist group. ※I would say the co-founder would be ＆Crooked' Hillary Clinton,§ Trump added. He went on to criticize Obama's decision to withdraw American military forces from Iraq and leaving behind a void for Daesh terrorists to fill. ※We should never have gotten out the way we got out,§ he said. ※We unleashed terrible fury all over the Middle East.\" ※Instead of allowing some small forces behind to maybe, just maybe, keep it under control, we pulled it out,§ he continued. Daesh terrorists, many of whom were initially trained by the CIA in Jordan in 2012 to destabilize the Syrian government, still control parts of Iraq and Syria. They have been engaged in crimes against humanity in areas under their control. They have been carrying out horrific acts of violence such as public decapitations and crucifixions against all communities, including Shia and Sunni Muslims, Kurds, and Christians.

    "text": "Email US President Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton ※founded§ the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group in the Middle East region, according to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Addressing supporters at a rally in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump said Daesh is \"honoring President Obama.\" ※He's the founder of ISIS. He's the founder! He founded ISIS,§ the real estate tycoon said, using an alternative acronym for the terrorist group. ※I would say the co-founder would be ＆Crooked' Hillary Clinton,§ Trump added. He went on to criticize Obama's decision to withdraw American military forces from Iraq and leaving behind a void for Daesh terrorists to fill. ※We should never have gotten out the way we got out,§ he said. ※We unleashed terrible fury all over the Middle East.\" ※Instead of allowing some small forces behind to maybe, just maybe, keep it under control, we pulled it out,§ he continued. Daesh terrorists, many of whom were initially trained by the CIA in Jordan in 2012 to destabilize the Syrian government, still control parts of Iraq and Syria. They have been engaged in crimes against humanity in areas under their control. They have been carrying out horrific acts of violence such as public decapitations and crucifixions against all communities, including Shia and Sunni Muslims, Kurds, and Christians.

    "text": "(Before It's News)\nRemember when the media, Barack Obama, and Democrats were finger-wagging and tut-tutting Republicans for saying Obamacare was going to be a failure? Remember how Obama said premiums were going to go down?\nFor the last 18 months, Obama and his fellow Democrats have been reduced to bragging about how many people are now ※covered§ by health insurance as if it was some real accomplishment. Two points to consider:\nIt is mandatory. People are merely obeying the law and getting a plan. The law's intention was for healthcare coverage to be more affordable, and that has not happened. Insurers are recognizing this problem. Younger people would rather be in a position where they pay the fine (which the administration is not enforcing), rather than the out of pocket costs for a health care plan. The CEO of Aetna said as much:\nHealthier people will avoid buying Affordable Care Act health insurance plans as premiums climb, threatening the stability of the market, Aetna Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said.\n※As the rates rise, the healthier people pull out because the out-of-pocket costs aren't worth it,§ Bertolini said at Bloomberg's The Year Ahead Summit in New York. ※Young people can do the math. Gas for the car, beer on Fridays and Saturdays, health insurance.§\nPremiums for health plans sold to individuals under the ACA, known as Obamacare, are going up by about 25 percent on average for next year. Bertolini said that as costs rise, more individuals will decide not to buy health plans. That'll push premiums even higher, unless a new president and lawmakers can find fixes for the new markets created by the 2010 health law.\nThe question over whether such problems get fixed is all dependent upon whether or no the President, be it Obama or Clinton, recognizes what divided government means. It is not to say, as President Obama believes, ※Here is what I need, now pass it so I can sign it.§ President Obama or President Clinton must recognize divided government means everything is on the table at the start of negotiations , not just what the President wants.\nThe post Aetna CEO On Obamacare: Young People Will Choose Beer First appeared first on RedState .",

    "text": "2016 presidential campaign by BAR executive editor Glen Ford \nBarack Obama tried to woo Republicans into a ※Grand Bargain§ that would have gutted Social Security. Bill Clinton let loose the banks. But Donald Trump's destruction of the Republican Party will allow Hillary Clinton to ※gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle.§ The rich are about to get their best deal yet. Hillary's ※Big Tent§ is Obama's ※Grand Bargain§ on Steroids by BAR executive editor Glen Ford \n※ The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class.§ \nWhen Donald Trump took a wrecking ball to the Republican Party he provided the unexpected catalyst for completion of the corporate project begun by Bill Clinton, Al Gore and other white Democrats in the 1980s, with the founding of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). To counter relentless attrition of whites to the GOP in their home states, these beleaguered, mostly southern Democrats sought national corporate funding to turn their party decisively to the right. They reckoned, correctly, that a steady stream of corporate capital would allow them to control the new wave of Black voters and politicians that had been mobilized by Rev. Jesse Jackson's two presidential campaigns, while strengthening the hand of the South in national Democratic Party calculations. \nBill Clinton became the first DLC president in 1992, and moved swiftly and methodically to narrow the ideological differences between the duopoly parties. He completed much of Ronald Reagan's agenda, claiming it as his own; destroyed welfare ※as we knew it§; vastly expanded the mass Black Incarceration regime; pushed NAFTA through Congress over the objections of majorities in his own party; engineered the corporate monopolization of broadcast media; and removed the last safety straps from Wall Street banks. \n※Clinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo.§ \nIn foreign affairs, Clinton initiated what was to become the doctrine of ※humanitarian§ military intervention, dismantling and partially occupying the socialist nation of Yugoslavia. In the process, Clinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo, thus keeping operational the network created by the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Pakistan during the previous decade in Afghanistan. In Africa, Clinton conspired with Uganda and exiled Tutsi rebels to overthrow the Hutu majority government in Rwanda, setting off a bloodbath in 1994, followed two years later by an invasion of Congo that has killed more than six million people -- and still counting. \nBarack Obama was the second DLC president (although he lies about his membership). He, too, moved with unseemly haste to reach a ※Grand Bargain§ with the GOP -- not of necessity, since he had won a huge electoral mandate with the overwhelming financial backing of Wall Street, but as a matter of ideological principle. In January of 2009, before even taking the oath of office, Obama told the editorial boards of the New York Times and the Washington Post that all ※entitlements,§ including Medicare and Social Security, would be ※ on the table § for cutting in his administration. Obama's first project, now considered the centerpiece of his legacy, was to resurrect the rightwing Heritage Foundation's corporate health insurance scheme, adopted by Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole in 1996, and made into state law by Republican Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, in 2006. Obama's Affordable Care Act was, literally, written by lobbyists for the insurance and drug industries, and is now collapsing like a poorly constructed house at the end of its mortgage. \n※For the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his ＆Grand Bargain.'§ \nWith the Democratic majority in Congress in no mood to tamper with Social Security and Medicare, Obama tried to maneuver the targeted entitlements into a financial crisis trap. He named two dependable reactionaries, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, as co-chairmen of his National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility, also called the Commission on Deficit Reduction. They dutifully recommended $4 trillion in budget cuts, mostly to social programs, including cuts to Social Security. Although the full commission did not endorse the chairs' recommendations, and the Congress failed to pass bills modeled on the document, Obama used the Simpson-Bowles formula as a basis for negotiating what he hoped would be a ※bipartisan§ (GOP plus Obama and a minority of Democrats) massacre of entitlements. For the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his ※Grand Bargain.§ Congressional Black Caucus chairman Emanuel Cleaver, of Kansas City, called the deal a ※ Satan's Sandwich ,§ but Obama continued to pursue a political marriage made in hell until the 2012 reelection campaign clock called a halt to the spectacle. \n※A de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie.§ \nThe quest for a Grand Bargain was Barack Obama's failed attempt to best Bill Clinton in erasing the distinctions between the two major parties 每 to create a de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie. It was the Republicans who ran away from the altar. And the Democrats did eat much of the Satan's Sandwich, through sequestration and austerity that ravaged social programs by other means. \nWhy did the Republicans reject the deal? Although both halves of the duopoly ultimately answer to Wall Street, the Republicans, like any other party, have an institutional interest in winning office. It is true that Obama had crafted a deal that any Republican would love, but it was still his deal, and he planned to run for reelection as an historical dealmaker. Probably just as importantly, the Republican Party is the White Man's party, meaning, white supremacy is its organizing principle, central to its identity among much of the masses. To embrace Obama, no matter how advantageous to their big business patrons, was a hug too far for the GOP. Racism doomed the Grand Bargain 每 Hallelujah! \nA New, Bigger Bargain \nRecently released Wikileaks emails reveal Hillary Clinton speaking to bankers at Morgan Stanley in 2013, a year after the debacle. ※The Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right,§ she said. \nThanks to Donald Trump's demolition of the Republican Party, the conditions have been created for Hillary Clinton, as DLC President #3, to achieve what #1 and #2 could not: gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle. With most of the ruling class and its attendants having vacated the building, the Republican Party has been reduced to Donald Trump and his ※deplorables,§ as Hillary calls them. Trump's opposition to corporate trade deals violated the Holy Grail against prohibiting capitalists from moving money and jobs around the world as they see fit, and his reluctance to support regime change as an inherent right of American exceptionalism has frightened and outraged the military industrial complex, the national security establishment, and all sectors dependent on the maintenance of empire. \n※An inherently unstable arrangement.§ \nClinton's Big Tent is not a temporary, election season dwelling. It is how she plans to govern. The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class, while at the same time the party nominally represents most of the folks who are abused and misused by that ruling class. It is an inherently unstable arrangement, and will soon be wracked by splits, as a post-Trump GOP attempts to lure its fat cats back and the darker and poorer constituencies consigned to the latrine area of Hillary's high class tent break to the Left for air. \nBut in the interim, Clinton will have a unique opportunity to cut grand austerity deals with all the ※big elements§ of Simpson-Bowles, to renege on her corporate trade promises, and to wage war with great gusto in the name of a ※united§ country. Ever since the Democratic National Convention it has been clear that the Clintonites are encouraged to consider everyone outside of their grand circle to be suspect, subversive, or depraved. Their inclusive rhetoric is really an invocation of a ruling class consensus, now that Trump has supposedly brought the ruling class together under one banner. In Hillary's tent, the boardrooms are always in session. BAR executive editor Glen Ford can be contacted at [email protected] .",

Racism doomed the Grand Bargain 每 Hallelujah! \nA New, Bigger Bargain \nRecently released Wikileaks emails reveal Hillary Clinton speaking to bankers at Morgan Stanley in 2013, a year after the debacle. ※The Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right,§ she said. \nThanks to Donald Trump's demolition of the Republican Party, the conditions have been created for Hillary Clinton, as DLC President #3, to achieve what #1 and #2 could not: gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle. With most of the ruling class and its attendants having vacated the building, the Republican Party has been reduced to Donald Trump and his ※deplorables,§ as Hillary calls them. Trump's opposition to corporate trade deals violated the Holy Grail against prohibiting capitalists from moving money and jobs around the world as they see fit, and his reluctance to support regime change as an inherent right of American exceptionalism has frightened and outraged the military industrial complex, the national security establishment, and all sectors dependent on the maintenance of empire. \n※An inherently unstable arrangement.§ \nClinton's Big Tent is not a temporary, election season dwelling. It is how she plans to govern. The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class, while at the same time the party nominally represents most of the folks who are abused and misused by that ruling class. It is an inherently unstable arrangement, and will soon be wracked by splits, as a post-Trump GOP attempts to lure its fat cats back and the darker and poorer constituencies consigned to the latrine area of Hillary's high class tent break to the Left for air. \nBut in the interim, Clinton will have a unique opportunity to cut grand austerity deals with all the ※big elements§ of Simpson-Bowles, to renege on her corporate trade promises, and to wage war with great gusto in the name of a ※united§ country. Ever since the Democratic National Convention it has been clear that the Clintonites are encouraged to consider everyone outside of their grand circle to be suspect, subversive, or depraved. Their inclusive rhetoric is really an invocation of a ruling class consensus, now that Trump has supposedly brought the ruling class together under one banner. In Hillary's tent, the boardrooms are always in session. BAR executive editor Glen Ford can be contacted at [email protected] .",

    "text": "2016 elections by Danny Haiphong \nFears of Trump should not obscure the fact that Barack Obama's reign was a disaster. ※Black America is in a worse condition than before, working class people as a whole have lost ground to a low-wage economy, and the world is closer to a World War III scenario than at any point prior.§ The struggle continues, but ※it is important to ensure that the protests against Trump are not allowed to be channeled back into the Democratic Party graveyard.§ Obama's Departure is One Reason to Feel Optimism for Trump's Arrival by Danny Haiphong \n※Only gridlock saved Social Security and Medicare from being privatized during his Presidency.§ \nThousands have taken to the streets across the country to protest Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 elections. The protests have mainly centered on Trump's racism, sexism, and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric spewed during his campaign. Protesters have yet to wrestle with Trump's positions on foreign policy and trade that made him a pariah to the majority of the ruling class. The struggle against capitalism and imperialism in the US remains immature even in the midst of positive growth in the movement against police brutality and racism in recent years. While Trump's overt bigotry gives cause for protest, there is one benefit of the Trump moment that should not be understated. That benefit is the much needed conclusion of the Obama era. \nDemocrats across the US are in a state of mourning over the departure of Obama. Democrats heralded Obama as the quintessential professional and consummate politician. His celebrity was peppered by the appearance of intelligence and rationality in the face of so-called Republican \"obstructionism.\" Obama's rule was advertised as a victory for the Black Freedom movement. His Administration possessed a vast marketing apparatus that defended him as the lesser-evil alternative to the racist vitriol of the White Man's Republican Party. \n※Obama's rule was advertised as a victory for the Black Freedom movement.§ \nBlack Agenda Report was one of the few on the left that warned of the dangers of Obama in 2008. Once elected, Obama became virtually untouchable. Criticisms of his policies were condemned as racist and insensitive to the needs of Black America. The needs of Black America and the entire left for that matter suddenly became aligned with whatever Obama did. Obama moved forward to protect the banks, escalate war, and erect the largest national security state ever assembled. He instantly became the austerity President, waging a war of privatization on public education with the expressed plans to do the same to Social Security. Only gridlock saved Social Security and Medicare from being privatized during his Presidency. \nThe full scope of Obama's legacy has been discussed in earlier issues and will not be analyzed here. What is important is that the left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism. No longer will the left be able to fall back on the first Black President to sanitize his record. Obama's immigration policies deported nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants with little protest. His Administration painted itself as a friend of women and LGBTQ identified people despite the fact that his policy of proxy and drone warfare murdered tens of thousands of women and children in Yemen, Syria, Libya, and Honduras. \n※The left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism.§ \nObama was able to conduct a greater assault on oppressed people than the prior Bush Administration, making him the most effective evil Wall Street could buy. Obama took over as President in a period where the US was mired in two unpopular occupations abroad and an economic crisis at home. These conditions prompted the ruling class to choose Obama as the required form of counterinsurgency necessary to crush resistance before it started. After making a number of promises to end \"dumb wars\" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class. Eight years later, Black America is in a worse condition than before, working class people as a whole have lost ground to a low-wage economy , and the world is closer to a World War III scenario than at any point prior. \nThe massive protests to Trump's victory are in part a release of popular energy brought on by the departure of Obama. Unrest began with the formation of the Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter movements. However, neither of these movements articulated Obama's role in creating the conditions for social insurgency and movement. The 2016 elections changed the landscape dramatically. The Sanders and Trump campaigns set millions into motion in protest of the two-party establishment. Obama's departure will be another breath of fresh air into the internal rot of the imperialist system. It is thus important to ensure that the protests against Trump are not allowed to be channeled back into the Democratic Party graveyard. \n※After making a number of promises to end \"dumb wars\" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class.§ \nObama will leave Trump a set of conditions that he cannot possibly maintain without popular unrest. Obama departs office only inches from World War III with Russia and China. Poverty and wealth inequality worsened under his administration . Not even clever distortions of statistics could hide the large number of workers currently unemployed or underemployed in the low-wage economy. School closures, food stamp cuts, and bank bailouts have unleashed the neo-liberal wasteland that Trump spoke about in his campaign. \nIt appears early on that the left has rejected the viability of Trump's calls to regulate the banks and renegotiate trade deals in favor of working people. Many have ignored Trump's ※populist§ rhetoric and have focused all the energy of resistance on his white supremacist proposals to ban Muslims and deport millions of undocumented people. However, this moment is just as much about Obama's departure as it is Trump's arrival. The US imperialist system is facing multiple crises that relate directly back to the economic stagnation of global capitalism. It would be a mistake not to demand Trump stay true to his ※populism§ just as it was a mistake when the left failed to demand Obama stay true to his promises. Whatever the case, the departure of Obama is a welcome site, and the left should use the room afforded by it to wage an intensified effort to build the organizational basis for social revolution in our time.

Obama moved forward to protect the banks, escalate war, and erect the largest national security state ever assembled. He instantly became the austerity President, waging a war of privatization on public education with the expressed plans to do the same to Social Security. Only gridlock saved Social Security and Medicare from being privatized during his Presidency. \nThe full scope of Obama's legacy has been discussed in earlier issues and will not be analyzed here. What is important is that the left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism. No longer will the left be able to fall back on the first Black President to sanitize his record. Obama's immigration policies deported nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants with little protest. His Administration painted itself as a friend of women and LGBTQ identified people despite the fact that his policy of proxy and drone warfare murdered tens of thousands of women and children in Yemen, Syria, Libya, and Honduras. \n※The left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism.§ \nObama was able to conduct a greater assault on oppressed people than the prior Bush Administration, making him the most effective evil Wall Street could buy. Obama took over as President in a period where the US was mired in two unpopular occupations abroad and an economic crisis at home. These conditions prompted the ruling class to choose Obama as the required form of counterinsurgency necessary to crush resistance before it started. After making a number of promises to end \"dumb wars\" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class. Eight years later, Black America is in a worse condition than before, working class people as a whole have lost ground to a low-wage economy , and the world is closer to a World War III scenario than at any point prior. \nThe massive protests to Trump's victory are in part a release of popular energy brought on by the departure of Obama. Unrest began with the formation of the Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter movements. However, neither of these movements articulated Obama's role in creating the conditions for social insurgency and movement. The 2016 elections changed the landscape dramatically. The Sanders and Trump campaigns set millions into motion in protest of the two-party establishment. Obama's departure will be another breath of fresh air into the internal rot of the imperialist system. It is thus important to ensure that the protests against Trump are not allowed to be channeled back into the Democratic Party graveyard. \n※After making a number of promises to end \"dumb wars\" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class.§ \nObama will leave Trump a set of conditions that he cannot possibly maintain without popular unrest. Obama departs office only inches from World War III with Russia and China. Poverty and wealth inequality worsened under his administration . Not even clever distortions of statistics could hide the large number of workers currently unemployed or underemployed in the low-wage economy. School closures, food stamp cuts, and bank bailouts have unleashed the neo-liberal wasteland that Trump spoke about in his campaign. \nIt appears early on that the left has rejected the viability of Trump's calls to regulate the banks and renegotiate trade deals in favor of working people. Many have ignored Trump's ※populist§ rhetoric and have focused all the energy of resistance on his white supremacist proposals to ban Muslims and deport millions of undocumented people. However, this moment is just as much about Obama's departure as it is Trump's arrival. The US imperialist system is facing multiple crises that relate directly back to the economic stagnation of global capitalism. It would be a mistake not to demand Trump stay true to his ※populism§ just as it was a mistake when the left failed to demand Obama stay true to his promises. Whatever the case, the departure of Obama is a welcome site, and the left should use the room afforded by it to wage an intensified effort to build the organizational basis for social revolution in our time.

    "text": "Trending Articles: Trending Articles: The Smoking Gun: Cheryl Mills Tells Podesta \"We Need To Clean This Up - Obama Has Emails From Her\" Published: October 26, 2016 Source: Zero Hedge \nRecall that in a March 2015 interview with CBS, just after the NYT reported of Hillary's use of a private email server, president Obama told the American public he had only learned about Hillary's \"unusual\" arrangement from the press. \nAs we further reminded readers one month ago, CBS News senior White House correspondent Bill Plante asked Mr. Obama when he learned about her private email system after his Saturday appearance in Selma, Alabama. \" The same time everybody else learned it through news reports ,\" the president told Plante. \" The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the BlackBerry I carry around, all those records are available and archived ,\" Mr. Obama said. \"I'm glad that Hillary's instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed.\" \nUnfortunately, the \"transparency\" of the Obama administration was severely tarnished in late September , when in the FBI's interview notes with Huma Abedin released by the FBI it was first revealed that Obama had used a pseudonymous email account: \"Once informed that the sender's name is believed to be pseudonym used by the president, Abedin exclaimed: 'How is this not classified?'\" the report says. \"Abedin then expressed her amazement at the president's use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email.\" \nTo be sure, this was not definitive evidence that Obama was aware of Hillary's email server, nor that there may have been collusion between the president and the Clinton campaign. \nThat changed today, however, when in the latest Podesta dump we learn that in an email from Cheryl Mills to John Podesta , the Clinton aide upon learning what Obama had just said... I have some questions here pic.twitter.com/ufkeoZCx2m \n〞 Katherine Miller (@katherinemiller) March 7, 2015 \n... countered with something quite stunning: \nwe need to clean this up - he has emails from her - they do not say state.gov \nThat, ladies and gentlemen, is proof that the president not only lied, but did so with the clear intention of protecting the Clinton campaign. \nAs a further reminder, Politico previously reported that the State Department had refused to make public that and other emails Clinton exchanged with Obama. Lawyers cited the \"presidential communications privilege,\" a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the Freedom of Information Act. It is therefore unknown what the president's \"alternative\" email account was, or who hosted it. \nThis also explains why in a prior Wikileak, Podesta told Mills in an email titled \"Special Category\" that she thinks \" we should hold emails to and from potus? That's the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I(t) seems like they will. \" Mills did not respond by email. \nThe Clinton-Obama emails were turned over to the State Department, which later announced it would not release them. \n* * * \nSo just how did Mills and Podesta \"clean up\" the fact that Obama lied to the American people, a tactic some could allege is evidence of an attempt to cover up a presidential lie to protect Hillary Clinton. \nWhat we do know, and we assume this is completely unrelated, between March 25-31, just a couple of weeks after Mills said \"we need to clean this up,\" Bleachbit was used to wipe Hillary's private server clean. But of course, that is purely a coincidence. \nSince we are confident others will also demand an answer, in light of the latest revelation hinting at a collusive cover up extending to the very top of US government, or as Cheryl Mills dubbed it a \"clean up\", perhaps it is time for the State Depratment to unveil just what was said between the president and the Clinton campaign?

That Obama also likes golf is one of the few things on which he and I could (in theory) relate. (My usual go to with my ※progressive§ friends is classic rock. If one can drink a beer, keep one's politics in check for a couple of hours and talk T-Rex and The Kinks we can be friends.)

    "text": "Obamacare ※Near Collapse§ in Minnesota as Prices Jump 60% Average   \nNews on Obamacare cannot possibly come at a better time for the Trump campaign. \nThe Obamacare exchanges in Minnesota are near collapse. \nThe state's insurance regulator says Minnesota health-care is in an ※emergency situation§ and calls the average 60% hike a ※stopgap for 2017§. \nPlease consider Near ＆Collapse,' Minnesota to Raise Obamacare Rates by Half . \nMinnesota will let the health insurers in its Obamacare market raise rates by at least 50 percent next year, after the individual market there came to the brink of collapse, the state's commerce commissioner said Friday. \nThe increases range from 50 percent to 67 percent, Commissioner Mike Rothman's office said in a statement. Rothman, who regulates the state's insurers, is an appointee under Governor Mark Dayton, a Democrat. The rate hike follows increases for this year of 14 percent to 49 percent. \n※It's in an emergency situation 〞 we worked hard and avoided a collapse.§ Rothman said in a telephone interview. ※It's a stopgap for 2017.§ \nOn average, rates in the state will rise by about 60 percent, said Shane Delaney, a spokesman for MNSure, the state's marketplace for Obamacare plans. About 250,000 people, or 5 percent of the state's population, were covered under plans bought on the individual market, including plans bought on the Affordable Care Act markets as well as outside it. \nLie of the Day \nThe lie of the day comes from Jonathan Gold, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \nMinnesotans would still have affordable options for coverage next year said Gold. ※Headline rate changes do not reflect what these consumers actually pay because tax credits reduce the cost of coverage below the sticker price.§ \nOf the about 70,000 people who had insurance on the Obamacare markets this year, 63 percent got subsidies last year, according to the commissioner's office. \nFor at least 37% of Minnesotans Obamacare is hugely unaffordable. For those who got small subsidies, Obamacare is hugely unaffordable. We do not have breakdowns by subsidy amount, but I suspect at lest 65% do not feel Obamcare is affordable. \nThose nearly broke with massive subsidies may view Obamacare as ※affordable§. Businesses sure don't and neither do those who get little or no subsidies. \nAlso in the not-affordable class are millions of healthy millennials who have to dramatically overpay so that a small subset of people benefit mightily. \nGovernment in Action Government in action:Obamacare was supposed to increase competition and reduce costs. Instead it decreased competition and increased costs. 〞 Mike Mish Shedlock (@MishGEA) November 1, 2016",

    "text": "Not Just Hillary, Entire Obama Administration Exposed for Using Private Email to Avoid FOIA Requests   Source: Jack Burns \nWikileaks is helping President Obama keep his 2008 campaign promise 〞 to be the most transparent administration in U.S. history 〞 whether he likes it or not. And, once again, we're learning more about the inner sanctum of the administration and its communication practices. As FBI Director James Comey announced Friday, a new investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal has been launched, just days before the presidential election. Comey's move drew fire instantly from the Democrats who claim Comey is attempting to sway the election in Donald Trump's favor. While many are focused on Comey's actions and renewed investigation, Wikileaks has uncovered what may prove to be a systemic problem of executive branch accountability not merely limited to the former secretary of state's emails. \nAccording to former State Department official Tom Nides, in a 2015 email to John Podesta (Clinton campaign manager), everyone in Obama's cabinet and every White House staffer uses their personal email for government business. Nides should know as he worked under Hillary Clinton in the State Department from 2011 to 2013, according to one source . \nWhile keeping email hidden from the public may seem like no big deal to folks who simply don't care, ALL correspondence which is related to governmental business is the property of the federal government and is supposed to be accessible by anyone wishing to inquire within the archive of records. \nThe Federal Records Act defines a record as anything, ※regardless of whether it exists in physical, digital, or electronic form, is a record as defined in subsection (a) shall be binding on all Federal agencies.§ This includes all communication of state agents (like the POTUS) who work in the executive branch of government, as well. \nBut the Obama administration, according to Nides, has long since avoided the Federal Records Act by using private Gmail accounts. Nides wrote Podesta and said, ※There is only one thing that needs to be done on this email thing. (Which I am sure nobody wants to do). Get a state dept career lawyer to go through all the emails and pull the official ones.§ That admission seems to be on the level with what is expected for compliance with the Federal Records Act. But it was Nides' next admission which is the talk of many major media outlets. \nNides wrote, ※Btw you know as well as I every god damn cabinet officer and WH staff uses their [sic] gmail account!§ The former Department of State employee revealed what many already suspected. The Obama administration is anything but transparent. Just ask Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. His organization routinely sues the Obama administration in federal court using the Freedom of Information Act as warrant for inquiry, and says the administration stonewalls his efforts at every turn. Fitton's organization gave the Obama administration a failing grade on transparency and says his administration is even less transparent than when Bush was president. \nFitton wrote in 2015 , ※There are about 18 lawsuits, 10 of which are active in federal court, and about 160 Judicial Watch FOIA requests that could be affected by Mrs. Clinton and her staff's use of secret email accounts to conduct official government business. In our various FOIA lawsuits, our lawyers have informed attorneys for the Obama administration that Hillary Clinton's account and any other secret accounts used by State employees should be secured, recovered and searched.§ JW actively seeks out those files through official methods, using FOIA and the Federal Records Act, but has been met with delay after delay from FOIA requests to the Obama administration. \nWhile the Obama administration is on its way out, groups like Judicial Watch aren't going anywhere, and presumably have all the time in the world to FOIA their way into digging up those deleted Clinton emails, as well as securing Gmail accounts from the Obama administration cabinet and staffers. This story is definitely a long way from being over. \nIt's no wonder why so many free thinkers are now questioning the story lines they're being told. With the president and all his men (and women), hiding their communications within their Gmail accounts, the truth is never going to be told, at least not the real truth. And by the time organizations like Judicial Watch are successful in obtaining the electronic communications records that rightly belong to the people, it will be way too late to hold anyone accountable for breaking both the Federal Records Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Julian Assange, we salute you. Thank you for forcing the Obama administration to be transparent. Keep up the valiant work!",

    "title": "Debunked: The Photo Of Obama With A Speech Balloo... | ClickHole",
    "text": "Email \nIn an age where information can be spread to millions of people within seconds, it's often difficult to separate fact from fiction. That was certainly the case a few months ago when a controversial photo of President Obama began to circulate online, with many insisting that the image was the real, unedited deal. But today that picture was officially debunked: The photo of Obama with a speech balloon saying ※Islam is my main thing§ has been proven to be doctored. \nWow. This is a good reminder to take everything you see on the internet with a grain of salt! \nTake a look at the photo in question above. In it, you can clearly see Obama proudly declaring his unshakeable Islamic faith. \nAt first glance, the photo looks like pretty clear evidence that Obama may be Muslim and confirms the suspicions of his most far-right critics, who insist the president has been dishonest with the public about his true religious beliefs. But when the image went viral on Twitter, one user pointed out a possible sign of doctoring: \nMany users agreed that the photo appeared to have been manipulated in some way and asked for an expert to weigh in. A graphic designer named Brendan McCann, whose Twitter bio says he's been in the industry for over a decade, quickly answered the call. \nBut it was Snopes that officially put the matter to rest. After scouring the internet far and wide, they were able to dig up the original version of the photograph, taken during one of the president's official White House photo ops, and there's no speech balloon upholding the teachings of the Quran anywhere in sight. \nTake a look at the two images side by side to see how the effect was achieved: \nWell, there you have it. It looks like whoever made this image took some of the space from above the president's head and used it to overlay the speech balloon on top. It's a powerful effect, but it's definitely not real. Remember: When it comes to the internet, always question your sources!",

    "text": "Email \nThe president has to be kicking himself over this one. \nAs his term in office comes to a close, it seems as if Barack Obama may have missed out on a pretty spectacular opportunity. Earlier today, the president was told that he had been allowed to sleep in the White House this whole time, after he spent nearly two full terms living in a hotel by Reagan National Airport. \nSorry, Mr. President, but it's true. You really blew your chance on this one. \nHaving booked an extended stay at the airport Hilton upon his inauguration back in 2009, Barack and his family have resided in an atrium-view room with two double beds and complimentary wi-fi for the past eight years. But earlier this week when a senior advisor asked the president why he had chosen to live by the airport instead of the White House, you could tell that Obama hadn't realized the choice was his to make until that very moment. \nYes, Obama's accomplished a lot over the years, but he's got to be wondering how much more progress he might have made living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He would have had a lot more time to work on signature policies like the Affordable Care Act if he hadn't wasted so much of his mornings commuting from the airport to the Oval Office on the D.C. Metro. There's no doubt the countless Hilton Rewards Points Obama has accrued is a nice perk, but that doesn't soften the blow of leaving the neoclassic mansion built exclusively to house the commander in chief and his family empty for two full terms. \nThis is something Obama is going to regret for a long time to come. \n※Nobody ever explicitly told me that I could live there until now,§ said a clearly disappointed Obama, as he waited patiently for a set of fresh towels. ※While Sasha and Malia love being on the same floor as the pool here, I now wish we had stayed at the lavish, 20,000-square-foot private residence in the White House for the past eight years. One time in 2011, I slept underneath my desk after a late night, and I was worried someone was going to find me there in the morning and yell at me. Now I'm being told we apparently have a personal chef and dozens of butlers. This sucks.§ \nSorry, Barry, but this one's kind of on you. Our advice to whoever the next president is? Don't miss your chance like he did.",

    "text": "PDF \nBy Adam Johnson | AlterNet \nCouncil of Foreign Relations resident skeptic Micah Zenko recently tallied up how many bombs the United States has dropped on other countries and the results are as depressing as one would think. Zenko figured that since Jan. 1, 2015, the U.S. has dropped around 23,144 bombs on Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, all countries that are majority Muslim. \nRelated Article: Atrocities Committed in the Name of the American Empire (Chris Hedges) \nThe chart, provided by the generally pro-State Department think tank, puts in stark terms how much destruction the U.S. has leveled on other countries. Whether or not one thinks such bombing is justified, it's a blunt illustration of how much raw damage the United States inflicts on the Muslim world: \nIt does not appear to be working either. Despite the fact that the U.S. dropped 947 bombs in Afghanistan in 2015, a recent analysis in Foreign Policy magazine found that the Taliban control more territory in Afghanistan than at any point since 2001. The U.S. has entered its 16th year of war in Afghanistan despite several promises by the Obama administration to withdraw. In October of last year, President Obama reversed his position and decided to keep American troops in Afghanistan until the end of 2017. \nRelated Article: The West's Latest Phony Military Narrative Is Aimed Directly At You \nThe last four U.S. presidents have bombed Iraq , and that includes the current one since airstrikes were launched on Aug. 7, 2014. The war against ISIS was originally framed as a ※ limited,§ ※humanitarian § intervention. Since then, former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has insisted it will be a ※ 30-year war § and the White House has spoken vaguely of a ※long-term effort§ in both Iraq and Syria.",

    "text": "Posted by Martin Walsh | Oct 26, 2016 | National Security New Allies Issue Bold New Warning To Obama \nThe world no longer respects the United States. \nThe leadership of Obama and Hillary Clinton has pushed us closer to World War III than ever before. \nHillary and Obama dislike Putin because he only answers to strength and toughness, which is exactly why he likes Donald Trump. As a way to project strength, Obama and Hillary continue to blame Putin for cyber attacks and the WikiLeaks releases. Putin Will No Longer Allow Obama And Hillary To Disrespect Russia \nOn October 21, Putin issued a global message that if Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama continue to slander Russia, he was going to shoot down U.S. jets in the Middle East and begin to prepare for World War III. \nTwo days after that, Putin ordered the Russian Defense Ministry to begin training and managing all local authorities, law enforcement, and state security as they are preparing for a nuclear war with the United States. \nAnd with the United States at the eve of war, Hillary Clinton continues to prance around calling Putin a ※thug puppet.§ \nPutin has now made his third move following Clintons comments, and he has brought Russian ally China into the fight. China is now sending a plethora of resources to the Middle East to assist Russia is pushing Obama and the United States out. \nNow the country is openly declaring its support to the Syrian government, which has become the bone of contention between the United States and Russia. The United States wants the Syrian government out, while Russia wants it to stay. \nThe People's Republic of China has announced that it will provide both military and humanitarian aid to the Syrian government, in order to help them fight the rebels trying to overthrow the regime. China Preparing For WWIII As Russia's Ally \nThe Chinese have dispatched dozens of top military advisers to strengthen the Syrian army against Obama and the terrorist groups he continues to arm in order to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \nChinese officials argue that they wanted to stay out of the Russia/U.S. conflict but Obama's actions have given them no choice. \nChinese officials argue that in 2015, they chose not to join the efforts in the Middle East. They argued that they would give Obama the opportunity to defeat ISIS and restore democracy in the Middle East. \nSince then, Obama has allowed ISIS to eclipse 50,000 fighters, they operate in more than 32 countries, a refugee crisis has sent more than 10,000,000 refugees all over the world, and now Obama wants to overthrow the Syrian regime每which would leave no one left to stop ISIS from controlling more territory. \nChinese officials argue, ※Obama has done this to himself, and he better not play with fire.§ \nThat is a direct threat from China to the United States. \nThings have gotten so bad under Obama that China and Russia are now joining forces to kick the United States out of the Middle East and are promising World War III if our leaders do not stop disgracing them publicly. \nWho can blame China for joining forces with Russia? If Obama's actions are leading us down a path to war with Russia and China, imagine how bad it will get it Hillary wins this election. \nA President Clinton worries Russia and China so badly that they are now preparing for nuclear war. Imagine how scared we should be as Americans.",

    "text": "Posted by Matthew Bernstein | Nov 10, 2016 | Liberal Corruption Thanks To The Protestors, He's Thinking Of Declaring Martial Law \nIn every competition out there, there will be a winner and a loser. It's just the way that competitions work. Literally everywhere you go there are competitions going on and there are always winners and losers. How To Make An Organic Super Food For Survial At Home - Watch Video Click Here \nWhen we are children, we are always taught to be gracious losers. Yes sometimes losing a tough competition hurts, but if you accept it graciously, people will always praise your character. The problem with today's young generation is that they have forgotten how to lose graciously. \nSince the announcement that Donald Trump has won the presidential election, liberals have been protesting this victory. They're literally ignoring everything that has been taught to them since we were children. It doesn't matter if you don't like the result; Trump won the election and that is a fact. \nBut these protests continue and there is one person that seems to be the mastermind behind it. That would be the ultra liberal billionaire George Soros. He was also responsible for financing some of the protest groups that was designed to have violence at the Trump rallies. George Soros Has A Plan In Place \nDuring the election season, it was discovered that Soros was behind some of the protestor's actions. He was paying them to create a scene and cause violence that would have the media talking about the Trump rallies. Now this shouldn't have been happening in the first place but it was. \nAnd now that Trump has been elected president of the United States, there are people that are out on the streets protesting his victory. It's a little ironic considering that liberals were the ones that were complaining about how Trump wouldn't accept the election results if fraud was detected. \nHere is the issue though. There are people out on the streets that are protesting a presidential election. These are the same people that were the ones inciting violence at the Trump rallies. And those people were paid by Soros to start, so it's likely that he is the one that is paying them to start civil unrest now. \nAnd there is a specific reason that Soros wants to have violence at the protests. That would mean that President Obama would have to declare Martial Law. This is how it works. It's literally a domino effect. There are people out protesting the election results. Obama Might End Up Declaring Martial Law \nBut when they start having mass amounts of violence at the protests then the entire country is going to start noticing. If that happens then there is going to be pressure on the president to solve it. President Obama would then declare Martial Law. \nMartial Law is when the president has to suspend transfer of power due to the fact that there is a ※National Emergency.§ Therefore if that would happen then Trump wouldn't be able to see the White House because Obama would still be the president of the United States. There is a good chance that this has been the back up plan for some liberals all along. \nAnd there is proof out there that the protests are staged. There are protests going on all over the United States and in one part of the nation, Austin, Texas, they found the buses that were used to bring the people in. Again these are planned in order to create civil unrest. They Literally Found The Busses The Protestors Used \nAnd there is more proof. The signs that the people brought to the protests were all created and printed by groups related to the Soros cause. You can't just print thousands of signs on a whim. These events have to be planned and thought out. And that is exactly what was happening. \nFinally the last bit of proof was that the Democrats and Soros have paid people to protest and create a disturbance at Trump events before. Since they have done it in the past, they are definitely going to do it now. And the Democrats are willing to pay them to create this disturbance. The Signs Were Created By Soros Groups \nBut the scariest part about all this is the fact that people are actually volunteering to protest the election just because Trump won. Again we are taught from a young age to accept defeat with graciousness. Right now they are acting like a bunch of spoiled kids because they didn't get their way. \nAnd now there is a possibility that Obama is going to declare Martial Law because of these protestors. They couldn't accept the fact that the country spoke and they wanted Trump in charge. But now they are actively interfering with a Democratic election because they want to complain about the choice. \nAgain this is all most likely due to Soros. And he has had a hand in it before. He wants to see a globalized country and that means that he will do whatever he can to make it happen. That includes ordering an attack on Trump Tower in Chicago . That was where some of the protests in the country were happening. \nBut he also had a hand in trying to fix the election. In 16 States they were using voting machines that were being produced by Soros controlled companies . Of course that meant that he was going to do what he could to rig the election. It most likely wouldn't have mattered if you voted Trump; the machines were going to submit for Clinton. \nShare this article to show people that Soros has a plan for all of these protests. He wants to make sure that they create enough of a civil disturbance that Obama will declare Martial Law and stop the transfer of power from him to Trump. That way the globalist agenda could still happen. \nHowever the best option is to not engage with the people that are out there. It's like handling a two-year-old child that is throwing a temper tantrum. If you just ignore them they will settle down. Therefore just ignore the protestors and don't engage with them.",

    "text": "Posted by Damon Morgan | Nov 10, 2016 | National Security Former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Got the Better of Obama in Nuclear Talks \nOn September 28, 2015, Argentinean President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner dropped a bombshell on the floor of the UN General Assembly 70th session. Until now, her story has been swept under the rug by a news media which has always been deferential to President Obama. \nMs. Kirchner told the story of how Argentina was visited by the White House in November 2010, with a secretive and unusual request. A full English translation of her speech is available here. \nDuring the time the event took place, Obama had just faced a stinging rebuke in midterm elections which saw a Republican takeover of the House, led by the insurgent Tea Party. The results of that election were a direct threat to Obama's mandate. Wikipedia describes the incredible upset this way: \nRepublicans regained control of the chamber they had lost in the 2006 midterm elections, picking up a net total of 63 seats and erasing the gains Democrats made in 2006 and 2008. Although the sitting U.S. President's party usually loses seats in a midterm election, the 2010 election resulted in the highest loss of a party in a House midterm election since 1938, and the largest House swing since 1948. This also happened to be the Republicans' largest gain in House seats since 1938. \nUnder the shadow of this election, Obama became concerned about the possibility of being a one-term president and leaving a damaged legacy. He had not been able to accomplish any notable achievements as president, and the economy was still reeling from the aftershocks of the 2008 real estate and stock market crashes. Obama Was Desperate for a Deal with Iran \nObama had been negotiating with Iran regarding their nuclear ambitions, and the world was watching. But negotiations had bogged down, with then Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad insisting on the need for nuclear fuel as part of the deal. \nAccording to Kirchner, the Obama White House intended to sidestep congressional approval and media scrutiny by quietly hatching a scheme where third party nations would supply the fuel. \nShe told the UN Assembly that Argentina was approached by a representative of Obama's White House, Gary Samore, who at the time served as the top adviser on nuclear issues. \n※Gary Samore had explained to our Minister of Foreign Affairs, H谷ctor Timerman, that negotiations were underway for the Islamic Republic of Iran to cease with its uranium enrichment activities or to do it to a lesser extent but Iran claimed that it needed to enrich this Tehran nuclear reactor and this was hindering negotiations. They came to ask us, Argentines, to provide the Islamic Republic of Iran with nuclear fuel.§ said Kirchner. \nShe went on to explain that Mr. Samore presented the following options: \nThe simplest and quickest one was for Argentina to provide the new nuclear fuel, as the original fuel had been designed by Argentina, who owned the intellectual property rights. \nAnother alternative was for Argentina to authorize Russia to supply the uranium, following the Argentine design. \nThe last alternative was for the United States or some other country with nuclear capacity to replace the operating core of the nuclear reactor with a new one using other non-Argentine fuel. \nPresident Kirchner was willing to help, but the issue was politically tricky. Argentina had been the original producer of the nuclear fuel used in the Tehran reactor, and held intellectual property claims to the material. However, there was ongoing tension between Iran and Argentina due to a terrorist bombing in 1994. \nThe AMIA bombing was an attack on the Asociaci車n Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA; Argentine Israelite Mutual Association) building. It occurred in Buenos Aires on 18 July 1994, killing 85 people and injuring hundreds. It was Argentina's deadliest bombing ever. The Bombing of the AMIA Building was the Deadliest in Argentina's History \nAfter a long series of incompetent and corrupt investigations into the incident, in 2005 Argentine prosecutors Alberto Nisman and Marcelo Mart赤nez Burgos formally accused the government of Iran of directing the bombing, and the Hezbollah militia of carrying it out. According to the prosecution's claims in 2006, Argentina had been targeted by Iran after Buenos Aires' decision to suspend a nuclear technology transfer contract to Tehran \nArgentina's justice, Israel, and the United States suspected in 2005 that Hezbollah was behind the attack, with backing from Iran. Hezbollah has denied responsibility. The Iranian government maintains its innocence, condemning the terrorist attack and calling for urgent punishment of those responsible. \nAfter many years spent on the case, Special Prosecutor Alberto Nisman was found dead in his home, on January 18, 2015. His body was discovered just six hours before he was due to explain his findings to congress. The official cause of death was a single self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, but there is a haze of suspicion surrounding the case. Argentinians March in Protest of the Lack of Justice for the AMIA Bombing \nTo this day the bombing case remains unresolved, and Iran has refused to extradite any of the suspects involved. \nPresident Kirchner continued with her address to the UN, explaining that she attempted to follow standard protocol and receive the White House request in writing: \nYou know that Argentina is a member of the select club of nuclear energy producing countries but that we occupy, nonetheless, a leading position in the field of non-proliferation. This means that non-nuclear proliferation is also a matter of governmental interest to us as well. \nI said as much to my Minister of Foreign Affairs who in turn relayed this to the White House's envoy, Gary Samore that we would accept to provide the fuel because it was in the hands of Argentina since 1987 and we also had the technique to produce it in exchange, obviously, for such request to be submitted in writing and signed. This message was conveyed and I believe that was the last time, after that communication, that our Minister of Foreign Affairs saw Gary Samore. \nSo, after her demand that the request for nuclear fuel be provided on the official record, the U.S. representative vanished and the issue was never mentioned to Kirchner again. This shows that it was intended to be a clandestine deal from the beginning, hidden from the American people. Former Iranian President Ahmadinejad Tours Nuclear Processing Facility \nWas Obama hoping to emerge as a hero after successfully negotiating a deal with Iran? If so, that effort fell flat. Recent investigations have revealed that he attempted another scheme in 2016 which involved making a cash down payment to Iran of more than a billion dollars, in order to secure the release of American hostages and to advance nuclear talks. \nWhen it comes to an issue as important as nuclear proliferation in radical Islamist nations, we need a president who will engage the issue with transparency, and in the interest of the American people and world community. President Trump will likely succeed where Obama has failed.",

    "text": "Posted by Matthew Bernstein | Nov 18, 2016 | American Strength He Wasn't Happy At The Latest Bill That Was Passed \nAs we all know the country has spoken and Donald Trump is set to be the 45 th president of the United States. He won the election fair and square, despite what the whiny liberals have to say about it. Of course that means that with his victory, President Obama is on his way out. \nWe are literally two months away from having President Obama leave the White House. That is something that should be applauded, considering the destruction that he has caused the country over the past eight years. But there was a fear that some Republicans had regarding the time leftover in office. \nConsidering the fact that Obama is leaving, there were fears that he was going to pass some legislation that would affect the country and be nearly impossible for Trump to repeal. These were going to be called the ※Midnight Rules§ and it was going to ensure that Trump was going to have some issues before tackling the issues he wanted to tackle the most. \nExcept that fear is NO MORE. The House of Representatives passed legislation, by a margin of 240-179, allows Congress to undo any of the last-minute rules and regulations that were going to be put on the books before President Obama leaves office. \nThe bill's sponsor, Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican out of California and the former chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, had this to say about the bill. ※This bipartisan bill is about reviving the separation of powers to ensure our laws are written by the representatives we actually vote for 每 not unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats who are on their way out the door.§ \nThis was put into place to make sure that Obama doesn't try to sneak any last minute laws by that would further his agenda. Which means that any law that he thinks is going to get through is going to get shut down by the GOP controlled Congress. Obama's Plans To Push His Agenda Through Last Second Have Been Just Squashed \n※Presidents of both parties have made habit of enacting scores of last-minute regulations, with little oversight, to sneak in as much of their agenda as possible before the clock runs out on their time in office.§ And there is still so much more that Obama wants to put in. After all, he was in favor of adding as many Syrian refugees as possible. \n※The bill helps ensure this President, and any future president, will be held in check and that their policies have the proper level of scrutiny by both Congress and the American people. I'm pleased to see the House pass this important measure and look forward to its quick passage by our colleagues in the Senate.§ \nThis was an important bill because Obama has shown that he is willing to undermine the Constitution. He has done so repeatedly, including one of the more recent examples being the $1.7 billion that he sent to Iran as part of the ransom payment for four American hostages. \nAnd it wasn't just members of Congress that were excited about this bill. FreedomWorks CEO Adam Brandon was also pleased with the House vote. He committed his Washington-based logistics and policy hub for conservative activists to working with Capitol Hill conservatives in making sure that law-making authority returns to Congress. \n※The Obama administration's regulatory agenda has been damaging to the economy and the destructive to separation of powers in Article I of the Constitution.§ He is completely right. The Constitution ensures that there is supposed to be a separation of powers between the branches and make sure that one of the branches isn't more powerful than the other. Obama Continues To Try And Destroy Our Constitution \nObama has proved over and over again that he wanted to go over the powers of Congress to make sure that his agenda was secure. This includes the fact that he tried to have millions of millions of illegal immigrants granted amnesty so that they were able to stay in the country and possibly vote. \nAnd they ended up voting! In this last election there were three million illegal immigrants that cast a ballot. That was despite the fact that they weren't allowed to vote considering that they aren't legal citizens of the United States! And yet the liberals were all in favor of this because they were all voting for Hillary . Anything to help her out right liberals? \nNot to mention that his ability to go over Congress has corrupted the minds of the younger generation. There have been several petitions out there that wanted to change the very basis of how this country works. First there was a petition that wanted to change the basis of electing the next president. \nAnd the second petition that was going around included people asking that President Obama go over his Constitutional policies to appoint the next Supreme Court member without the consent of the Senate. Of course that is just another example of people saying that he should do what he can to overthrow the Constitution . \nShare this article with your friends and family to show them that Congress has just passed a law that is going to make it impossible for Obama to implement any of his policies at the last second. This rule is going to make it impossible for him to try and push his agenda. \nThis was the necessary change that needed to happen. President Obama has done enough to undermine the Constitution since he first sat in office eight years ago. And now any plans that he had to continue to do so until Trump gets into office have been destroyed.",

Now, with less than three months to go in office, Obama appears to be leaving his Syria policy to those aligned with the lead hawk who might soon take Obama's place. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office. \nAs Secretary of State until early 2013, Hillary Clinton failed to convince Obama to consistently take a tough line on Syria. She wanted him to realize her two main policies, which she still clings to: a ※safe zone§ on the ground and a ※no-fly zone§ in the air 每 meaning that Syrian government forces and their allies, including the Russians, would be barred from operating in those areas. \nProtected by U.S. air power and other military means, rebels seeking to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would, in effect, have an untouchable staging area to launch attacks on the government without its ability to hit back. Clinton has called removing Assad a top foreign policy priority. \nClinton followed a similar model in 2011 when she convinced a reluctant Obama to adopt a plan in Libya to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi under the pretext of ※protecting civilians§ when Gaddafi launched an offensive against rebels in eastern Libya whom he identified as terrorists. After the U.S. and European military intervention, Gaddafi was ousted, tortured and murdered 每 prompting Clinton to quip ※we came, we saw, he died§ 每 but the ※regime change§ turned Libya into a failed state. \nIndeed, the Libyan chaos 每 now with three rival governments and terrorist enclaves 每 has become emblematic of the disarray following ※regime change§ that has marked nearly two decades of neoconservative influence in Washington, a strategy of dividing and weakening defiant states while U.S. contractors profit from the chaos that bleeds the locals to death. \nLost Lessons \nObama learned from Libya, which he deemed his biggest regret for having no plan for the aftermath. The fiasco left him deeply skeptical about intervention in Syria, although 每 given his prescient opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq 每 he should have already understood what happens after the U.S. overthrows regimes these days. Ousted Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi shortly before he was murdered on Oct. 20, 2011. \nIn the early years of the CIA 〞 in Syria in 1949, Iran in 1953, and Guatemala in 1954, as illegal and as unjustified as those coups were 〞 the agency had viable leaders groomed to take over. But all that changed after the Cold War ended. Then careless wishful thinking replaced any careful planning. \n※We can use our military in the Middle East and the Soviets won't stop us,§ arch-neocon Paul Wolfowitz boasted before the Iraq invasion. \nToday neoconservatives and liberal interventionists (such as Clinton) act like gamblers who can't leave the table. Disasters for Iraqis, Libyans and others haven't dissuaded these American war advocates from pushing more chips onto the table over Syria. Indeed, their failures 每 and the lack of any personal accountability for their catastrophes 每 seem to have only emboldened them to keep gambling. \nThese ※regime change§ schemes 每 in the guise of ※spreading democracy§ in the Middle East 每 have only spread chaos and terrorism, but those conditions only give the hawks more reasons and excuses to intervene, thus creating more chaos and making more money, while weakening nations defying Washington. \nClinton began laying a bet on ※regime change§ in Damascus by pushing to arm rebels in the summer of 2012. One of her leaked emails explains her motive: to break up the Teheran to Damascus to southern Lebanon supply line to Hezbollah 〞 a longstanding Israeli objective. \nAt that point, Obama refused to arm the rebels, but the President apparently didn't have full control over his national security bureaucracy, which seemed to have found ways to aid the Syrian rebels despite Obama's reluctance, possibly by encouraging U.S. regional allies, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Israel. \nAn August 2012 Defense Intelligence Agency document , which was made public last year, showed that U.S. intelligence agencies were well aware of where these operations were headed, with or without Obama's approval. \nRet. Gen. Mike Flynn, who ran the DIA at the time, has said it was a ※willful decision§ in Washington to support a ※Salafist principality§ 〞 a safe area for jihadist rebels 〞 in eastern Syria to put pressure on Assad's government in Damascus. Flynn didn't say who in Washington ultimately decided on this risky scheme, but the DIA document warned that the Salafists could join with jihadists from Iraq to form an ※Islamic State.§ And indeed two years later, that was exactly what happened. \nWhile this ※Salafist principality§ was gestating in summer 2013, Obama again showed some independence on Syria after assessing the disastrous consequences of the Clinton-led ※regime change§ in Libya, i.e., a failed state radiating arms and jihadis to Syria and the Sahel. \nHowever, at this point 每 battered by think-tank and media commentaries decrying him as ※soft§ and ※weak§ 每 Obama compromised with the hawks and eventually agree d to arm and train some of the rebels, supposedly the ※moderate§ kind. But he resisted pressure to launch cruise missiles against Syrian government targets after his ※red line§ was supposedly crossed by a chemical weapons attack outside Damascus that killed hundreds of people. \nAs we now know, the CIA did not think it was a ※slam dunk§ that the Syrian government did it, though the mainstream U.S. media imposed a ※group think§ blaming the sarin attack on Assad. But significant evidence pointed to the rebels trying to create an incident that would draw the U.S. military into the war directly on the jihadist side. \nSensing that a trap was being laid to entice the U.S. into another Mideast war, Obama instead took Russia's offer to have Syria give up its chemical weapons stocks, which in time it did, infuriating the neocons. \nAn Even Bolder Putin Offer \nRussian President Vladimir Putin followed with another offer to the United States in September 2015, delivered from the podium of the U.N. General Assembly. He proposed joint U.S.-Russian airstrikes against the now fully formed Islamic State and associated jihadists. Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses UN General Assembly on Sept. 28, 2015. (UN Photo) \nMore than three years earlier, I reported that Russia's motive to support Assad was to stop the spread of jihadism that threatened the West and Russia. Before the U.N., Putin put it on the record, invoking the World War II alliance between the Soviet Union and the West to confront a greater threat, Nazism. \n※Similar to the anti-Hitler coalition, it could unite a broad range of parties willing to stand firm against those who, just like the Nazis, sow evil and hatred of humankind,§ Putin said. \nBy then, the jihadists had clearly become the greater evil in Syria with their practice of decapitating Western hostages as well as locals deemed religious ※apostates.§ In time Islamic State also would plan or inspire terror attacks in France, Belgium, Germany, Egypt and the United States. By contrast, Assad was an undemocratic leader governing a police state but he posed no threat to the West. \nHowever, by 2015, the demonization of Vladimir Putin was well underway and his offer was spurned by Western leaders. Obama, who faced mainstream ridicule for ※failing to enforce his red line§ in Syria and for not being tough enough on Russia, joined in rejecting Putin's offer. \nWe now know why. In a leaked audio conversation with Syrian opposition figures in September, Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S., rather than seriously fight Islamic State in Syria, was ready to use the growing strength of the jihadists to pressure Assad to resign, just as outlined in the DIA document. \n※We know that this was growing, we were watching, we saw that Daesh [a derisive name for Islamic State] was growing in strength, and we thought Assad was threatened,§ Kerry said. ※We thought however we could probably manage that Assad might then negotiate, but instead of negotiating he got Putin to support him.§ \nRussia began its military intervention in late September 2015 without the United States, with the Kremlin's motives made abundantly clear by Putin and other Russian officials. \nFor instance, last month, Putin told French TV channel TF1: ※Remember what Libya or Iraq looked like before these countries and their organizations were destroyed as states by our Western partners' forces? ＃ These states showed no signs of terrorism. They were not a threat for Paris, for the Cote d'Azur, for Belgium, for Russia, or for the United States. Now, they are the source of terrorist threats. Our goal is to prevent the same from happening in Syria.§ \nSuch clear explanations are rarely reported clearly by Western corporate media, which instead peddles the line from officials and think tanks that Russia is trying to recover lost imperial glory in the Middle East. \nWorries about Damascus \nBut Kerry knew why Russia intervened. ※The reason Russia came in is because ISIL [another acronym for Islamic State] was getting stronger, Daesh was threatening the possibility of going to Damascus, and that's why Russia came in because they didn't want a Daesh government and they supported Assad,§ he said in the leaked discussion. Kerry's comment suggests that the U.S. was willing to risk Islamic State and its jihadist allies gaining power in order to oust Assad. Secretary of State John Kerry with Samantha Power, U.S. Permanent Representative to the U.N., at the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 20, 2016. (UN Photo) \nKerry's comments echoed those of senior Israeli officials who have pronounced the ※Shiite crescent§ from Iran through Syria to Hezbollah's territory in Lebanon as Israel's greatest strategic threat and have expressed a preference for an Al Qaeda or even an Islamic State victory in Syria to shatter that centerpiece of the ※Shiite crescent.§ \nIn September 2013, in one of the most explicit expressions of Israel's views, its Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren, then a close adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the Jerusalem Post that Israel favored the Sunni extremists over Assad. \n※The greatest danger to Israel is by the strategic arc that extends from Tehran, to Damascus to Beirut. And we saw the Assad regime as the keystone in that arc,§ Oren told the Jerusalem Post in an interview . ※We always wanted Bashar Assad to go, we always preferred the bad guys who weren't backed by Iran to the bad guys who were backed by Iran.§ He said this was the case even if the ※bad guys§ were affiliated with Al Qaeda. \nIn June 2014, Oren reiterated his position at an Aspen Institute conference. Then, speaking as a former ambassador, Oren said Israel would even prefer a victory by Islamic State, which was then massacring captured Iraqi soldiers and beheading Westerners, than the continuation of the Iranian-backed Assad in Syria. \n※From Israel's perspective, if there's got to be an evil that's got to prevail, let the Sunni evil prevail,§ Oren said. \nIsrael's preference extended into a tacit alliance with Al Qaeda's Nusra Front in Syria, with which the Israelis developed essentially a non-aggression pact, even caring for Nusra fighters in Israeli hospitals and mounting lethal air attacks inside Syria against Lebanese and Iranian advisers to the Syrian military. \nIn hoping that the jihadists could spearhead the overthrow of Assad while somehow not achieving a full-scale victory, U.S. officials may have thought they could somehow eat their cake and have it, too. \nYet, that represents a major risk, essentially assuming that Assad would step down in some orderly transition of power rather than be ousted in a chaotic fight to the finish. But U.S. officials were apparently willing to take the chance of an Al Qaeda/Islamic State victory in Damascus. \nPutin warned the General Assembly about such a gamble with terrorism: ※The Islamic State itself did not come out of nowhere. It was initially developed as a weapon against undesirable secular regimes.§ He added that it was irresponsible ※to manipulate extremist groups and use them to achieve your political goals, hoping that later you'll find a way to get rid of them or somehow eliminate them.§ \nStopping the Jihadists \nRussia's intervention seriously reversed the jihadists' advances, alarming Saudi Arabia and Turkey. In February, they demanded that the U.S. support their invasion of Syria. It was a momentous moment for Obama: Would he risk war with Russia to save another ※regime change§ project? Video of the Russian SU-24 exploding in flames inside Syrian territory after it was shot down by Turkish air-to-air missiles on Nov. 24, 2015. \nU.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter, a committed neocon, ※welcomed§ the Saudi-Turk plan to launch an invasion by air from Turkey's Incirlik NATO air base and by land through the wastelands of Jordan or western Iraq. The Saudis staged a 30,000-man invasion war game in the desert. But Obama again stood up for reason and stopped it, at least for a time. \nIn July, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his backers crushed an attempted coup . Erdogan seized the opportunity to eliminate almost all opposition to his near-total one-man rule. By late August, Erdogan was ready to make his next move with no one left in Turkey to oppose him. \nOn Aug. 24, with U.S. air cover, Turkey invaded Syria. This time Obama did not stop him. Washington clearly approved as its planes protected Turkish tanks and infantry rolling across the border. Vice President Joe Biden was in Ankara a day before the invasion. \nThe pretext was to fight Islamic State, but it became clear immediately that Turkey's main target was to block advances by the Syrian Kurds, one of Islamic State's toughest foes on the ground. The U.S. protested those attacks, but Washington surely knew what Turkey's intentions were. \nThe date 每 Aug. 24 每 was significant because it was the 500 th anniversary of the start of the Ottoman empire when the Ottomans left Turkey and invaded their first country 〞 Syria. \nIt was hardly a coincidence when one considers Erdogan's history. He spurred a violent police crackdown in Istanbul's Ghezi Park in 2013 against demonstrators protesting his plan to build a replica of an Ottoman barracks in the park. In April, Erdogan named a new bridge over the Bosphorus after Osman, founder of the Ottoman Empire. \nAn initial target of the invasion also was significant. On Oct. 16, Turkish-backed rebels captured the Syrian town of Dabiq from Islamic State, the site of a victory in 1516 that established the Ottoman Empire. \nListening to Russia \nStill, Obama continued to drag his heels regarding a deeper U.S. role in Syria. Obama resisted the hawks again this summer by allowing Kerry to negotiate with Russia on Putin's offer at the U.N.: to form a military alliance against Islamic State and Al Qaeda in Syria. Russia's 2015 entry had turned the tide of the war in Syria's favor but the war against the insurgency has stalled in Aleppo, where a third of the city remains largely under Al Qaeda control. Map of Syria. \nWhile Obama publicly slammed the Russians, projecting that they were on an imperial adventure that would wind up in a quagmire (exactly what has afflicted U.S. imperial adventures in various theaters), he kept plans for a safe zone and no-fly zone on hold. \nNearly a year after Putin's U.N. offer and after months of intermittent talks, Kerry and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Sept. 9 finally reached a deal to jointly fight terrorists in Syria. It was clear the agreement would ground the Syrian air force, resume humanitarian aid and agree on the identity of rebels to be jointly attacked, but U.S. officials insisted the terms remain secret. \nBut Defense Secretary Ash Carter made no secret of his objection. On Sept. 8, he said : ※In the current circumstance, it is not possible for the United States to associate itself with 〞 let alone to cooperate in 〞 a venture that is only fueling violence and civil war.§ \nIt was an extraordinary act of insubordination for which Carter was not punished. Once again Obama chose not to completely stand up to the hawks while authorizing a policy that they opposed. \nBut then Carter's objection to the deal went beyond words. Two days before it was to go into effect, warplanes from the U.S. military coalition killed more than 60 Syrian soldiers near Deir ez Zor in an air strike the Pentagon later said was an ※accident.§ U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power was hardly repentant as she condemned Russia's attempt to discuss the incident at the Security Council as a ※stunt.§ \nFour days later, a U.N. aid convoy was attacked near Aleppo, killing more than 20 aid workers. The U.S. immediately blamed Russian air strikes without presenting any evidence. Russia says rebels were responsible. The U.S.-Russia deal was dead. \nMoscow eventually revealed the deal's terms. At its heart was the separation of U.S.-backed rebels from Al Qaeda, which dominates a third of Aleppo. But once again, despite repeated pledges to do so, the U.S. government failed to separate them. Indeed, some ※moderate§ groups double-downed on their alliance with Al Qaeda. \nSyria and Russia had enough and declared all rebels fighting with Al Qaeda to be fair game. They commenced a furious bombardment of east Aleppo to crush the insurgency there once and for all. Putting all of Aleppo back into government hands would be a major turning point in the war but it has not proven easy. Instead the fierce aerial assaults have claimed numerous civilian lives, handing Russia's opponents a public relations coup. \nComplaints of War Crimes \nWashington, London and Paris are leading the chorus of war crimes accusations against Russia (though the U.S. and Britain invaded Iraq without Security Council authorization in an act of aggression that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and can reasonably be seen as the supreme war crime.) British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President George W. Bush shake hands after a joint White House press conference on Nov. 12, 2004. (White House photo) \nRussia's actions in Aleppo have been compared to Israel's in Gaza. Two U.N. reports have said Israel may have been guilty of war crimes in 2012 and 2014 attacks on Gaza, but Israel has not been prosecuted at the International Criminal Court. \nThe differences between Gaza and Aleppo are stark, however. Gazans are an indigenous people attacked by an Occupying Power. Syria and Russia are attacking the occupiers of east Aleppo 每 many of them foreign-backed mercenaries. \nPeople in Gaza cannot escape the city because of their attackers, while people in east Aleppo can't escape because civilians who attempt to leave come under sniper fire. Also, rebel rockets fired from east Aleppo into west Aleppo kill large numbers of civilians, unlike Hamas' rockets fired into Israel. \nBut the most significant difference between the two cases of terrible human suffering is that the West defends Israel and deflects charges of war crimes while it accuses Russia and Syria of war crimes. \nIsolated from the context of the entire Syrian war against a foreign-backed rebellion, the battle for east Aleppo (usually reported as the whole city) has been framed by Western liberal media in the same way Sarajevo was in the 1990s. \nThen a highly complex war was boiled down to one battle, where Bosnian Serbs fired into civilian areas as part of a larger war aim (although the attacks were portrayed as simply a lust to kill civilians). Today it is Russia that Is accused of acting out of the pure intent to kill civilians with no other motive. \nThe media's reaction to the bombardment of east Aleppo has led to a sharp increase in rabid calls for Western military intervention against the Syrian government and possibly against Russia. The British parliament held a Russia-bashing session in October, including calls for war against Moscow. Neocon newspapers, such as The Washington Post, are itching for battle. A British general said the U.K. would be ready to fight Russia in two years 〞 enough time for a Clinton administration to prepare. \nAlready, U.S. neocons and liberal hawks are dreaming about ※regime change§ in Moscow with Putin replaced by a Wall Street-friendly leader like Boris Yeltsin who let Western interests plunder Russia's resources during the 1990s. Yet, that may be just another example of the U.S. failure to anticipate the likely consequences of interventions. \nEven if Russia could be destabilized sufficiently to unseat Putin, the more likely result would be the rise of a fierce Russian nationalist, not a pro-Western ※liberal§ in the mold of Yeltsin. That might increase the risks of nuclear war, rather than give the West another compliant Russia. \nPlus, Putin would not be easily ousted, especially given his strong popular support, according to opinion polls. Indeed, some internal criticism of Putin has been that he has tried too hard to accommodate the West. \nBut Washington's modus operandi has been to continually provoke and blame a country until it becomes an adversary and stands up for itself, as Putin's Russia has done. Then, the West accuses the country of ※aggression§ and justifies attacks against it as ※self-defense.§ \nWe see these winds of war blowing in Ukraine, the Baltics, Poland and the Balkans 〞 with NATO's military posturing to counter ※Russian aggression§〞 and in Syria, where neocon calls are increasing for the U.S. to strike the Syrian government. \nOne More Stand \nObama, apparently for the fourth time, kept the hawks at bay after a White House meeting last month in which military action was turned down in the face of Russia's warning that it would target attacking U.S. aircraft. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addressing the AIPAC conference in Washington D.C. on March 21, 2016. (Photo credit: AIPAC) \nOver the past five years, Obama has been almost the only brake on keeping the Syrian conflict 〞 and relations with Russia 〞 from spiraling completely out of control. But his voice is fading as he prepares to leave office on Jan. 20, 2017. \nInto this fevered environment steps Hillary Clinton who may win the White House within the week. She continues to call for a safe zone and a no-fly zone, despite the warning last month from Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the joint chiefs, that that would mean war with Russia. \nStill, Hillary Clinton has continued pushing for a military intervention as recently as the last presidential debate. \n※I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria ＃ not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians,§ Clinton declared. \nShe said this after admitting in one of her paid speeches , released by Wikileaks, that a no-fly zone will ※kill a lot of Syrians.§ \nThe ※safe zone§ is supposed to shelter internally displaced Syrians to prevent them from becoming refugees. But it could also be used as a staging ground to train and equip jihadists intent on regime change, as was done in Libya. A safe area would need ground troops to protect it, although Clinton says there will be no U.S. ground troops in Syria. \nBut Turkey also has been clamoring for a safe area on the ground for the past few years. Erdogan called for one (as well as a no-fly zone in northern Syria) as recently as last September in his address to the U.N. General Assembly. \nRussia's reaction has been defiant, setting up an ominous game of chicken that could go nuclear. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia would shoot down any American plane attacking the Syrian government. Russia has also deployed sophisticated air defenses in the country. This has given U.S. brass deep pause about confronting Russia in Syria. So far Russia has come out on top there, lessening the risks of confrontation that could escalate to the most dangerous levels. \nBut would Hillary Clinton back down from her harsh rhetoric if she's elected? Or would she appoint more hawkish military leaders? Obama's half-way measures in Syria have left the door open to a Clinton administration that appears determined to ratchet up the regime change operation by calling Putin's bluff. \nShe also seems poised to arm the Ukrainian government and perhaps give Putin an ultimatum: give back Crimea or else. But what if Putin calls Clinton's bluff and refuses, given the fact that the people of Crimea voted by 96 percent in a referendum to leave Ukraine and rejoin Russia? It's a roll of the dice the hawks might be ready to toss. \nWashington's hawks appear to have bested Obama this last time, since he has not stood in the way of Clinton's allies inside his administration letting Erdogan pursue his neo-Ottoman fantasy (even to the point of fighting U.S.-backed Kurds) in exchange for Turkish NATO forces establishing a safe area without U.S. ground troops. Turkey and its rebel forces already control about 490 square miles in northern Syria. \nWith less than three months left in office, Obama appears to have finally surrendered on Syrian policy, ceding it to the next president. \nJoe Lauria is a veteran foreign-affairs journalist based at the U.N. since 1990.

    "text": "How did the ※growing trust§ that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his ※working and personal relationship with President Obama § change into today's deep distrust and saber-rattling?\nTheir relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the ※feverish§ state of international relations and lamented: ※My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.§ He complained about ※people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice§ and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a ※common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.§\nA month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, ※My good friend John Kerry ＃ is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry's] assurances that the U.S. commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief.§\nDo not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire 〞 not to mention statements at the time by the most senior U.S. generals 〞 were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia.\nRelations between the U.S. and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft 〞 including any stealth aircraft 〞 over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft.\nIt seems possible that the U.S. air force will challenge that claim in due course 〞 perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, ※I wouldn't put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft ＃ if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground.§\nInjecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia's warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a U.S. or coalition aircraft.\nMeanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the U.S. is contributing ※a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team§ as a ※major sign of the U.S. commitment to strengthening deterrence here.§\n※This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,§ he explained, referring to NATO's July summit meeting in the Polish capital. ※The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany.§\nOn Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the ※myth§ of a ※Russian military threat,§ calling this a ※profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets ＃ expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders.§\nMyth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia's borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against ※saber-rattling,§ adding that, ※We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation.§\nSpeaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two and a half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d'谷tat in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia's reaction in annexing Crimea. Americans malnourished on the diet served up by ※mainstream§ media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the U.S. ambassador in Kiev, during which ※Yats§ (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington's choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev.\nThis unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, ※really the most blatant coup in history.§\nIt's time for Western politicians and media to learn their lesson and pay attention to the statements coming out of Russia.

    "text": "Home | World | Experts: Obama Helped Trump With Illegal Database Experts: Obama Helped Trump With Illegal Database By Carlos Moh車n 15/11/2016 09:43:43 \nARIZONA 每 USA 每 As the Obama administration encouraged illegal immigrants to come over the border, Donald Trump wants to stop this, and send them back. \n\nThanks to Obama's initiative to acquire a database of illegal immigrants in America, and a pledge of amnesty , which allowed many to sign up, Donald Trump now has a complete list of people to be deported from America. \nEvery year many people try to gain entry into the United States utilising legal channels of entry, and millions are denied. It is therefore wrong that many others who wish to come to America can just walk across a border, and were encouraged to do so under the Obama administration. \nTrump has already outlined a plan to deport 2-3 million illegals who arrived illegally from South American countries and who pose a serious danger to the populace. The deportation of illegals with criminal records and links to gangs will be a first step, however there are still approximately 12 million known illegal aliens residing within the U.S.'s border, and these will be rounded up and deported in the next year or so. \nThe logistics of rounding up these people and putting them on secure buses back to the border will be enormous. Some advisers are saying that there will be elements who try and flee from immigration control officers, however, they will have no place to go. They will not be able to work, or rent out a place to sleep, once they are caught they too will be rounded up and thrown out of the country. \nMany illegal immigrants are now going underground or fleeing back across the border, so Trump has a big job in front of him, that is if he does not go back on his word.

We can see what is happening today with the EU referendum, a vote that was conclusively for Brexit by 17.5 million people, 52% of the electorate. The vicious bad sportsmanship of socialists and Marxists are being witnessed now with illegal judicial trickery and they are doing everything in their power to derail the decision. \nThere is no such thing as fair play or honour when it comes to these devout socialists who employ every dirty trick in their arsenal to back stab, renege on previous promises or legitimate democratic votes. \nThey are not men of honour, they instead utilise nasty underhand cowardly techniques to destabilise and engender a scorched earth policy, all the while, whining and moaning with a collective droning sound. \nSo, the next two months will be another example of nasty socialism that has lost, another example of how socialists use their power to punish those who voted against them. These disgusting, vile creatures will do everything now to get you, the populace who had enough of their control freakery, their underhand techniques, and their never ceasing effort to halt freedom of speech, freedom of expression and general human freedom. \nOnly stunted morons of the lowest intelligence cannot distinguish satire from fake news, but these are people without any sense of justice, or literary knowledge, they do not care as long as their agenda punishes those who fight for freedom. bono vinci satius est quam almo more iniuriam vincere A good man would rather suffer defeat than defeat another by foul means (Sallust) \nThe Daily Squib says to these uncouth vagabonds, these lowly turgid vipers splattering their poisonous inhibitive wares of excrement onto the halls of true satire, an indominitable force, which has survived for thousands of years 〞 you are nothing. \nYou will be left with nothing, for you are inconsequential, you are irrelevant, you will not be remembered, you will be forgotten in the sands of time, lesser than excrement, or turds that align your ideology of dishonour and hatred for purity. \nYou will perish without having achieved anything, without even a speck of true creativity or reason, you will be erased from the universe, imploded, and fucked for eternity, for your ill-will, your duplicitous lies will follow you into the deepest depths of the hatred you have created. \nA profound Fuck You follows you to your graves, and may history erase your awful memory forever a stain on the collective conscience of humanity.",

    "text": "Desperate Obama RIPS Comey: 'We Don't Operate On Innuendo' By: November 2, 2016 \nBarack Obama must be pretty worried. \nEarlier this week, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told the media that FBI director James Comey's decision to reopen an investigation into Hillary Clinton didn't spring from bias or politics. He explained : \nDirector Comey is a man of integrity and principle and well regarded by officials in both parties and served as a senior position in the Bush administration and got bipartisan support when his nomination to be director of the FBI was considered by the United States Senate... they speak to his good character and the president's assessment of his integrity and his character has not changed. For example, the president doesn't believe that Director Comey is trying to influence the outcome of the election. And the president doesn't believe he's secretly supporting a candidate or political party. He's in a tough spot. He's the one who will be in the position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts including officials who served in senior justice position for presidents led by both parties. \nNow, with the polls closing to within the margin of error, President Obama has had second thoughts. He told NowThisNews : \nI do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we don't operate on innuendo and we don't operate on incomplete information and we don't operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete decisions that are made. When this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasn't anything there that was prosecutable. \nIt's worthwhile pointing out the hypocrisy here 每 Obama's entire administration has been built on innuendo. His Department of Justice has destroyed police departments around the country with unsubstantiated innuendo about systemic racism. His IRS used innuendo to destroy conservative 501(c)3s. His entire 2012 campaign was rooted in innuendo about Mitt Romney's supposed secret evils. \nBut more than anything, the Obama flip here shows serious desperation. What changed? The polls. On Monday, it looked like the FBI scandal would detract from Hillary's polling numbers, but wouldn't kill her. Now it looks like she might go down in flames. This shows how faithless Obama is 每 Comey was wonderful just up until the point he threatened Hillary's chances, at which point he became a slanderer trafficking in innuendo. \nIf Comey has any stones, he should resign in protest at Obama's accusations. He's already been thrown under the bus by his commander-in-chief for not playing dead for him long enough to move Hillary into the White House. He's got no future in his position no matter what he does. It would be a final redeeming move of honor to tell Obama and his cronies to stuff it now. Tags",

    "text": "Obama Won't Go Away After He's Done. That's Good News. By: November 21, 2016 \nSo, soon-to-be-ex-President Obama won't be going away anytime soon. \nAfter George W. Bush left office, he essentially went silent. He had no criticism for President Obama; he didn't sound off about Mitt Romney or Donald Trump. He went away. Not so for Obama. It seems that Barack Obama will follow the Jimmy Carter pathway to Annoyingland: he'll be commenting whenever possible. After acknowledging that Bush ※could not have been more gracious to me when I came in,§ Obama said, ※As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle or go to core questions about our values and ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, I'll examine it when it comes.§ \nThis comes as welcome news for Republicans. Obama's policy unpopularity 每 and his tendency to lecture from on high to Americans in rural areas 每 means that he'll suck all the oxygen out of the room when it comes to criticizing Trump and Republicans. Middle Americans voted for Trump in order to sound off against Obama's obvious scorn for them. Here's what Obama had to say about those who didn't vote for Trump in today's Der Spiegel : \nIf you look at the new generation of Americans, they reflect the vision that I spoke about. They're diverse. They believe in tolerance. They're accepting of things like same-sex marriage. They believe in integration. The problem, though, is that young people are less likely to vote than older people. What results is a situation in which sometimes the elections don't fully reflect the views of the American population. Essentially, the president-elect was supported by about 27 percent of the American population. One of our challenges, historically, is that we have very low voting rates, even during presidential elections. \nThis sort of language drove Americans to Trump. And if Obama continues to critique Trump from the outside with this sort of language, not only will he be doing Trump a favor, he'll be preventing any other Democrat from taking a leading role in opposing Trump. He'll become the point of resistance for his own party 每 and his party won't be able to escape his shadow. \nObama's ego has already cost his party the presidency, the Senate, the House, a bevy of state legislators and governor's mansions. Now it may cost them the future. \nExcellent.",

    "text": "Posted on October 26, 2016 by Tony Elliott \nIt appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. Reports are circulating that the Clintons have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank , via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. \nThis move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself, Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn't plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. \nThe country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States , thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. \nDonald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office, he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server. All the way to gun running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi . \nPresident Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million dollar seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016 , another non extradition country. \nSnopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama's purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams. However, over the last several months, these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true . Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has. \nThe Bush family has been quietly buying property, as well with the purchase of 100,000 acres in Paraguay in 2006, yet another country good for the Bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime. If the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the Bush Administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on 9-11 , the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request. Apparently, if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous, the Bushes plan on getting out of the country as well. \nCourtesy of Freedom Outpost \nTony Elliott is an established writer with articles in over 20 publications of differing topics.

    "title": "Will Barack Obama Delay Or Suspend The Election If Hillary Is Forced Out By The New FBI Email Investigation?",
    "text": "Posted on October 29, 2016 by Michael Snyder \nJust when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a game changer into the mix . On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails ※did not come from her private server§, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the ※emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry§, and according to some reports there may be ※potentially thousands§ of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? \nLet's take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ \nAfter recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ※appear to be pertinent§ to the email probe. \n※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,§ Comey wrote the chairmen. ※I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.§ \nAt this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton's closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton's Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ \nWe don't know what this means yet except that it's a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that's where we are＃ \nIs it a certainty that we won't learn before the election? I'm not sure it's a certainty we won't learn before the election. \nOne thing is, it's possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ \nIf the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? \nIt is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. \nSo those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. \nBut if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year's primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group's bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nIt would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. \nIn such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be ※fair§ until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. \nMeanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. \nAnd CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ \nAn artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. \nMogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. \nThe AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. \nWithout Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. \nSo if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. \nAt this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.

    "text": "If you signed up for Obamacare, you've been screwed. \nIf you didn't sign up and opted to pay the penalties , you've been screwed. \nIf you didn't sign up, didn't pay penalties, and stuck with your original insurance company, you've been screwed. \nIf you didn't sign up, didn't pay penalties, and paid cash for medical care, you've been screwed. \nEvery person in America has been affected, regardless of what you did or did not do. \nThat's because the Affordable Care Act irrevocably ruined our access to medical care at an affordable price in this country. In the mere span of 4 years, the prices have skyrocketed and many families have to pay more in monthly premiums than they pay on their mortgages. Meanwhile, medical costs have been driven up to astronomical prices, making it nearly impossible to pay out-of-pocket for care. \nAnd these premiums? They are for the crappiest coverage you can imagine. Some families pay $1500-2000 a month for 60% coverage after they pay the $5000 deductible. That's nearly $20,000 per year before Obamacare pays for a penny of their costs. \nAnd now＃now that insurance companies have gone belly up when they were forced to become a part of the ※exchange,§ medical costs are skyrocketing, doctors won't see patients who aren't ※covered,§ employers stopped offering insurance as a benefit, and people lost their jobs due to Obamacare costs＃ \nThe whole thing is failing. Even President Obama has admitted it . And now we have proof that it was planned that way. \nBut that isn't the worst of it. The worst of it is that this program was designed to fail and steer us into single payer healthcare, where a government entity can decide what procedures will or will not be covered. They'll decide who is deserving of cancer treatment and who is not. They'll mandate things like flu shots and childhood vaccines. \nOne of the recent Wikileaks shows that Hillary Clinton knew this and was complicit. \nMelissa Dykes of The Daily Sheeple wrote : \nIn an email thread dated September 26, 2015 between Hillary and her senior policy adviser Ann O'Leary titled ※Memo on Cadillac Tax for HRC,§ Hillary wrote, ※Given the politics now w bipartisan support including Schumer, I'll support repeal w ＆sense of the Senate' that revenues would have to be found. I'd be open to a range of options to do that. But we have to be careful that the R version passes which begins the unraveling of the ACA .§ \n※Which begins the unraveling of the Affordable Care Act.§ \nA Democrat supporting Republican legislation to destroy Obamacare on purpose. How many millions have they raked in on this deal and bilked the American people for in Obamacare penalties because they can't afford the ※affordable§ health care? And the American people will look at this like a ※victory§ when it does unravel, even though it has been the plan all along. \nHillary Clinton, that savior of woman and children, knew that this would fail . She is supporting the legislation to destroy it, leaving everyone in America at the mercy of the horrible replacement that she will dream up to redistribute wealth and deal the death blow to the already-struggling middle class. \nMark my words, as bad as this disaster is, it is only going to get worse. Watch this video for the full story. \nCourtesy of Daisy Luther Don't forget to follow the D.C. Clothesline on Facebook and Twitter.

    "title": "Will Michelle Obama Be The Replacement Nominee If The FBI Email Investigation Ends Hillary Clinton's Campaign?",
    "text": "Posted by Michael Snyder \nI realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre, but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen. We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. \nIn fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled ※ Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside ※＃ \nSo what should the Democrats do now? \nIf ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: \nThey would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. \nDemocrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. \nBut what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year's primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group's bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nSo if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. \nWho would they choose? \nLet's take a look at the top five options＃ \n#1 Tim Kaine \nHe would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton's running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. \nAnd at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. \nSo to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. \n#2 Joe Biden \nVice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run ＃ \nVice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. \nBiden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. \nBut according to the vice president, the short answer is ※no.§ The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. \nUnfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. \nBiden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn't have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. \nBiden would probably represent the ※safest§ choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. \n#3 Bernie Sanders \nBernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. \nFirst of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. \nSecondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. \nThirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be ※another McGovern§ and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. \nSo even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. \n#4 Elizabeth Warren \nElizabeth Warren would be very popular with the ※Bernie Sanders§ wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. \nSo she is definitely a possibility. \nBut she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as ※another McGovern§ because of her far left policies. \n#5 Michelle Obama \nOne recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. \nAnd these days Barack Obama's approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. \nSo the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. \nMichelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as ※the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign§ in a recent MSN article entitled ※ In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice ※＃ \nThe speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama's place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. \n※When you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,§ said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. ※We know she didn't like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.§ \nIf I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. \nOf course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. \nAnd I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. \nIn the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. \nAnd if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down. \nMichael Snyder is the founder and publisher of The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream .

Although this type of race-baiting has been going on for a number of years now, it became more noticeable during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. When these liberals accuse Donald Trump of being racist, they had better be careful for one specific reason: \nA leaked video from 2008 shows that during President Obama 's first campaign, he was also concerned about border security, and he even suggested a wall! Now, there is just one dominant question anti- Trump individuals need to digest: \nIs Obama a racist too? Because he was talking about some things you could easily accuse Trump of. Let's play a quick game. If you didn't know who said this, would you think it was Donald Trump in 2016 or Barack Obama in 2008? \nThis man's core goal was to ※preserve the integrity of our borders to reduce illegal immigration.§ Does this sound like Trump or Obama ? \nHow about this one? This man said, ※additional fencing could help get our border under control.§ Definitely sounds more like a GOP candidate than a Democrat one, that's for sure. \nFinally, this man also supported ※additional personnel, infrastructure, and technology on our border and at ports of entry.§ Liberals would love to claim these quotes came from Donald J. Trump , especially considering he is the villain du jour in their lives at the moment. \nI hate to steal their thunder, but these quotes did indeed come from a young Barack Obama in 2008. Even he understood the need for a controlled border before the special interests in this country got to him. \nSo, it is one thing when leaked videos show Hillary Clinton believed border security was important. It was entirely another when they showed that her husband thought it was important, but when liberal idol Barack Obama says it? Say it isn't so! Liberals just can't handle that. \nBut anyway, folks, it is all about platforms. I'm sure you have learned by now that Donald Trump doesn't get the free pass other politicians in this country enjoy. First of all, he is a conservative, so he is already someone every liberal loves to hate. \nRepublicans have been so badly demonized in this country simply for desiring to get it under control. Luckily, people saw through the propaganda and decided that Obama 's brand was simply not working any longer. \nPeople are fed up with politicians who say one thing and do another. If you are looking for a reason why Donald Trump is the new president and not Hillary Clinton, there you go.",

    "text": "Mittwoch, 9. November 2016 So ein ?rger! Obama hat 邦ber Nacht s?mtliche Atomcodes verloren Washington (dpo) - Wie konnte das nur passieren? Barack Obama soll in der Nacht zum heutigen Mittwoch seinen Atomkoffer verloren haben. Das gab der scheidende Pr?sident nach den ersten Hochrechnungen zur Wahl bekannt. Er glaube auch nicht, dass dieser innerhalb der n?chsten vier Jahre wieder auftauchen werde. In dem Koffer befinden sich unter anderem die streng geheimen Atomcodes, auf die ausschlie?lich der Pr?sident Zugriff hat. Obama erkl?rte sein Missgeschick so: \"Ich schaute gerade gespannt die ersten Prognosen zur Wahl, als ich pl?tzlich zu meinem Entsetzen bemerkte, dass der Koffer weg war. Was bin ich nur f邦r ein Schussel!\" Er habe zwar sofort das komplette Wei?e Haus abgesucht, aber die Codes blieben verschwunden. \"So ein ?rger. Naja, n邦tzt ja nichts. Aber die Codes wurden in der Vergangenheit ja ohnehin nicht ben?tigt, deshalb ist der Verlust nun nicht ganz so tragisch. Mein Nachfolger wird auch ohne Atomkoffer auskommen. Vielleicht f?llt mir ja in vier Jahren wieder ein, wo ich das Ding hingepackt habe.\" Nicht hinter dem Sofa, nicht unter dem Schreibtisch und auch nicht von Bo im Garten vergraben... Der Atomkoffer ist und bleibt verschwunden. Zeit f邦r eine noch intensivere Suche hat Obama, der in zwei Monaten das Wei?e Haus r?umen muss, eigenen Angaben zufolge leider nicht. \"Ich muss ja noch Sch?nheitsreparaturen f邦r die 邦bergabe durchf邦hren. Gerade bin ich dabei, alle R?ume pink zu streichen.\" Es sollte nicht das einzige Missgeschick des Pr?sidenten bleiben: Nur kurz nach offizieller Bekanntgabe von Trump als Wahlsieger trat ein peinlich ber邦hrter Obama erneut vor die Mikrofone und teilte mit, dass er \"bl?derweise\" jetzt auch noch ein Glas mit hochaggressiven Termiten fallen hat lassen, die das Wei?e Haus bis zur offiziellen 邦bergabe wom?glich schwer besch?digen werden.",

    "text": "Von wegen Staatsbesuch: Barack Obama ist offenbar auf Wohnungssuche Berlin (dpo) - Plant da jemand einen Umzug? Bei seinem letzten Deutschlandbesuch als US-Pr?sident h?ufen sich die Hinweise darauf, dass Barack Obama nicht etwa hier ist, um mit Angela Merkel eine seiner wichtigsten Verb邦ndeten ein letztes Mal zu treffen, sondern heimlich nach einer neuen Wohnung sucht. Das melden mehrere Quellen aus dem Umfeld der Bundeskanzlerin. Schon kurz nach Obamas Landung in Berlin war Beobachtern aufgefallen, dass sich der US-Pr?sident bei Merkel auff?llig oft nach Immobilienpreisen erkundigte und einzelne R?ume von Geb?uden, die er besuchte, mit einem Zollstock ausma?. Auch f邦r Parkm?glichkeiten sowie Entfernungen zu Schulen und Superm?rkten habe sich Obama immer wieder brennend interessiert. \"How much is the house behind us, Mr. Sour?\" \"Auf mich wirkt das schon ein wenig verd?chtig, dass der Pr?sident so kurz vor dem Ende seiner Amtszeit und quasi direkt nach Donald Trumps Wahlsieg ganz pl?tzlich noch einmal dringend nach Europa muss\", erkl?rt eine Mitarbeiterin des Kanzleramts, der an der Planung von Obamas Deutschlandaufenthalt beteiligt war. \"Er hat sogar einen kleinen Stapel mit Proben verschiedener Tapetenmuster dabei, die er in fast jedem Raum an die Wand h?lt.\" Au?erdem habe Obama Merkel gefragt, ob er einige sperrige M?belst邦cke, die er nach eigener Aussage \"zuf?llig\" in der Air Force One mit sich f邦hrte, vor邦bergehend im Kanzleramt \"zwischenlagern\" d邦rfe. Sp?testens im Januar wolle er sie wieder abholen. Auch beim Programm der First Lady gab es verd?chtige Momente, etwa als sich Michelle Obama von Merkels Gatten Joachim Sauer deutsche Immobilien-Apps zeigen lie? und sich nach dem Unterschied zwischen Kalt- und Warmmieten erkundigte. Eine pers?nliche Erkl?rung des US-Pr?sidenten zu den Ger邦chten steht noch aus 每 es ist jedoch davon auszugehen, dass er auf der f邦r heute geplanten Pressekonferenz mit Angela Merkel im Kanzleramt Stellung beziehen wird.

Kennedy ein邦bte: \"Ick bin ein Berliner!\" dan, ssi; Foto [M]: picture alliance / empics / Shutterstock Artikel teilen:",

I would like to meet him.§ As for Trump, he's very excited to meet Malik as well. ※I look very much forward to meeting and being with Malik,§ Trump said. ※He gets it far better than his brother.§ Malik was once a Democrat, but he's said that foreign policy missteps and social concerns have caused him to move to the Republican side. He has also said he distrusts Hillary Clinton, citing her scandals and dishonesty, which he says have only gotten worse since he originally voiced his support for Trump. ※I don't like [Hillary] Clinton,§ Malik said in September, in spite of his half-brother's proud endorsement. ※She is dishonest and a liar. She keeps on lying about emails every time.§ Malik has slammed Clinton's performance as Secretary of State, pointing out that she inflamed chaos and violence in the Middle East.

    "text": "Comments Actor Steven Seagal has just stood up for America, while the rest of Hollywood remains silent. This week has been rough for our country. First, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial. Then, she called millions of hardworking Americans ※deplorable.§ As if that weren't enough, NFL players throughout the country have been blatantly disrespecting the American flag.

Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,§ he argued. He then went on to address race relations in the United States, and the true role President Barack Obama has played in the social evolution of this country. ※Obama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,§ he wrote. Seagal concluded by pointing out the irony of the attacks he was receiving from liberals everywhere. ※Best thing in the world＃Making one statement about freedom and getting attacked by every Demo out there＃ #HYPOCRITICAL,§ he tweeted. ※An America without a democrat in the White House, is a SAFER America.§ What do you think of Seagal's comments?",

    "title": "BREAKING: We Caught Obama Spending 30 Million Dollars Against Trump To Rig This Election | EndingFed News Network",
    "text": "Email Print It's no secret that Obama and his puppets are doing everything they possibly can to rig the election against Trump. Positive Trump polls are coming all the time, so it's all hands on deck from the Democrats to do whatever it takes to hand the election to Hillary. Obama's latest move involves registering immigrant voters who will most likely be voting for Hillary in November and he's spent TONS of your taxpayer money doing it. From Judicial Watch : Months after the Obama administration spent $19 million to register new immigrant voters that will likely support Democrats in November, it's dedicating an additional $10 million in a final push as the presidential election approaches. The money is distributed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Homeland Security agency that oversees lawful immigration, to organizations that help enhance pathways to naturalization by offering immigrants free citizenship instruction, English, U.S. history and civics courses. Officially, they're known as ※citizenship integration grants.§[＃] Judicial Watch went on to say＃ The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been aggressive in promoting its citizen integration grant program this year, offering large sums to recruit new groups that can offer immigrants the services they need to become citizens. Clearly, the ultimate goal is qualifying as many immigrants as possible to vote since they tend to cast ballots for Democrats. ※We intend to award about $1 million to first-time recipients in the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program for fiscal year 2016,§ the agency's grant announcement states. ※If you represent one of these organizations, or know of an interested organization, we strongly encourage that organization to consider applying. Additionally, another $9 million will fund programs that provide both citizenship instruction and instruction and naturalization application services.§ Some might consider this a cash giveaway.[＃] Practically every federal agency is participating in the effort by contributing resources and creating programs to help immigrants. For example the Department of Labor (DOL) is implementing ※new workforce programs§ for the ※new Americans§ and the Department of Education is promoting ※funding opportunities§ to assure that the immigrants ※are provided the tools they need to succeed.§ The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is collaborating with other agencies to release a career and credentialing toolkit on ※immigrant-focused career-pathways programs.§ The Department of Justice (DOJ) and USCIS are making sure the new Americans have worker rights and protections and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is launching a two-year pilot to assure that non English speakers have ※meaningful access to housing programs§ subsidized by American taxpayers. Obama likes to pretend that he's doing this for the greater good of America, but the truth is it's just part of the overall agenda to do whatever it takes to make sure Democrats run Washington and continue to drive our country into the ground.

    "text": "Email Print The Democrats have become synonymous with the word scandal in this election. We have yet another scandal and reason to distrust Obama and Hillary Clinton〞just for you. President Obama's Justice Department has been caught red handed stealing money, which should be going to victims of crimes, and putting it into the hands of left-wing advocacy groups, as per Breitbart . This new scandal comes after we saw Hillary Clinton cleared of charges for acid washing her emails. This clearance came from the Justice Department, as run by a person who had private meetings with Bill Clinton prior to the decision. This also happened after Hillary Clinton said that if she was elected, she would reappoint the current attorney general〞that same person〞Loretta Lynch. The key facts of this news scandal are as follows: the Justice Department has millions of dollars of taxpayer money that is usually reserved for the victims of serious crimes. However, Obama has been funneling money, in the ballpark of $650 million, away from victims of serious crimes and towards organizations that are helping him. This money is supposed to be going to victims of federal crimes like gang violence, wall street corruption, or other white collar crimes. It's normally used for restitution of the money the victims lost as a result of criminal actions. Is it surprising Obama thinks this money should be lining his pockets instead? Obama and his cronies find ways to make these left wing advocacy groups ※victims§ of crimes. These are organizations are signing people up to vote, going to rallies, knocking on doors, and helping elect Hillary Clinton〞not advocacy groups that need restitution of money lost to criminals. Obama's Justice Department has failed us once again. Instead of abusing taxpayer money, this Justice Department should be prosecuting Hillary Clinton for lying to Congress, destroying evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena, and obstructing justice. This is, alone, is enough to impeach the president, but we all know there simply isn't enough time left in his presidency to do so. But, maybe we could get the paperwork rolling just to scare him a little bit! If elected, it is clear Hillary Clinton will continue these corrupt practices, especially with Loretta Lynch as her attorney general. The Justice Department especially will remain a pay-to-getaway operation. Do you think Obama's scheme of funneling money is ethical?

    "title": "BREAKING: Obama Now Considering Martial Law Because Of Mass Riots | EndingFed News Network",
    "text": "Email Print In every competition out there, there will be a winner and a loser. It's just the way that competitions work. Literally everywhere you go there are competitions going on and there are always winners and losers. When we are children, we are always taught to be gracious losers. Yes sometimes losing a tough competition hurts, but if you accept it graciously, people will always praise your character. The problem with today's young generation is that they have forgotten how to lose graciously. Since the announcement that Donald Trump has won the presidential election, liberals have been protesting this victory. They're literally ignoring everything that has been taught to them since we were children. It doesn't matter if you don't like the result; Trump won the election and that is a fact. But these protests continue and there is one person that seems to be the mastermind behind it. That would be the ultra liberal billionaire George Soros. He was also responsible for financing some of the protest groups that was designed to have violence at the Trump rallies. During the election season, it was discovered that Soros was behind some of the protestor's actions. He was paying them to create a scene and cause violence that would have the media talking about the Trump rallies. Now this shouldn't have been happening in the first place but it was. And now that Trump has been elected president of the United States, there are people that are out on the streets protesting his victory. It's a little ironic considering that liberals were the ones that were complaining about how Trump wouldn't accept the election results if fraud was detected. Here is the issue though. There are people out on the streets that are protesting a presidential election. These are the same people that were the ones inciting violence at the Trump rallies. And those people were paid by Soros to start, so it's likely that he is the one that is paying them to start civil unrest now. And there is a specific reason that Soros wants to have violence at the protests. That would mean that President Obama would have to declare Martial Law. This is how it works. It's literally a domino effect. There are people out protesting the election results. But when they start having mass amounts of violence at the protests then the entire country is going to start noticing. If that happens then there is going to be pressure on the president to solve it. President Obama would then declare Martial Law. Martial Law is when the president has to suspend transfer of power due to the fact that there is a ※National Emergency.§ Therefore if that would happen then Trump wouldn't be able to see the White House because Obama would still be the president of the United States. There is a good chance that this has been the back up plan for some liberals all along. And there is proof out there that the protests are staged. There are protests going on all over the United States and in one part of the nation, Austin, Texas, they found the buses that were used to bring the people in. Again these are planned in order to create civil unrest. And there is more proof. The signs that the people brought to the protests were all created and printed by groups related to the Soros cause. You can't just print thousands of signs on a whim. These events have to be planned and thought out. And that is exactly what was happening. Finally the last bit of proof was that the Democrats and Soros have paid people to protest and create a disturbance at Trump events before. Since they have done it in the past, they are definitely going to do it now. And the Democrats are willing to pay them to create this disturbance. But the scariest part about all this is the fact that people are actually volunteering to protest the election just because Trump won. Again we are taught from a young age to accept defeat with graciousness. Right now they are acting like a bunch of spoiled kids because they didn't get their way. And now there is a possibility that Obama is going to declare Martial Law because of these protestors. They couldn't accept the fact that the country spoke and they wanted Trump in charge. But now they are actively interfering with a Democratic election because they want to complain about the choice. Again this is all most likely due to Soros. And he has had a hand in it before. He wants to see a globalized country and that means that he will do whatever he can to make it happen. That includes ordering an attack on Trump Tower in Chicago . That was where some of the protests in the country were happening. But he also had a hand in trying to fix the election. In 16 States they were using voting machines that were being produced by Soros controlled companies . Of course that meant that he was going to do what he could to rig the election. It most likely wouldn't have mattered if you voted Trump; the machines were going to submit for Clinton. Share this article to show people that Soros has a plan for all of these protests. He wants to make sure that they create enough of a civil disturbance that Obama will declare Martial Law and stop the transfer of power from him to Trump. That way the globalist agenda could still happen. H/T: Conservative Daily Post However the best option is to not engage with the people that are out there. It's like handling a two-year-old child that is throwing a temper tantrum. If you just ignore them they will settle down. Therefore just ignore the protestors and don't engage with them. \nIf you haven't checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so. Leave a comment...",

    "text": "Email Print Donald Trump is reportedly firing around 500 of Barack Obama's staffers, as he plans to completely fill the White House with his own team. The Federalist Papers reported that though it's likely that Hillary Clinton would have let most of Obama's people go so that she could hire her own staff, Trump's win closed the door on the possibility of any of Obama's staffer sticking around. The fired staffers have gotten so desperate about their employment situation that Obama has brought in representatives from Facebook, Instagram and other companies to offer insights into the job market. According to CBS News , Linkedin officials are helping Obama's staff find ways to market their skills. Georgetown University, which is located close to the White House, has designed a custom professional development program they call ※Future44,§ Obama is the 44th president, to teach Obama's political appointees how to build their lives after the White House. The program is free of charge thanks to an anonymous donor, and participants register for either four 2-hour evening sessions or one 8-hour ※boot camp.§ ※We designed this unique curriculum to help these staffers think through how to market themselves or market their competencies,§ said Kelly Otter, dean of Georgetown's School of Continuing Studies. Many of Obama's staffers will likely end up in liberal cities like New York or San Francisco working for companies that cater to millennials such as Amazon, Snapchat, Google, Vice, etc. ※The transition out of government is a reality for most appointees, which brings both excitement about prospects for the next chapter or a long-awaited chance to recharge batteries, and a keen awareness about a big, impending change,§ said White House spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman. Ivan Adler, a headhunter at McCormick Group, explained that Obama's staffers are about to face a major change in life that may be hard to get through. ※I tell everybody: You have to understand there's likely nothing you will do professionally that will have the same amount of excitement you've just gone through in the White House, unless you become a racecar driver or an astronaut,§ he said.

    "text": "Email Print President Obama has proven he is nothing but a vindictive man who is upset like the rest of the liberals that the person he was lobbying for didn't win the 2016 election. But you'd never guess what he did with hit time in the Oval Office running out. President Obama has shut down the aerial surveillance over the U.S./ Mexican border with only two months left in his presidency. He's trying to make it difficult for President-Elect Donald Trump, as per Watchdog.org The Department of Homeland Security can no longer do its job, and it is not securing the southern border with even the limited measures it has at its disposal right now! This is a move to help illegal immigrants come into this country, with Obama making it less difficult for them to break the law! They won't be seen, and, thus, they won't be caught. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security shut down Operation Phalanx, the aerial program that helps halt the movement of drugs and illegals across the border. This DHS move is challenged by Rep. Henry Cuellar, who claims that Congress gave this operation funding for the whole year of 2017. Cuellar, who is a member of the House Appropriations Committee and the Homeland Security Subcommittee, is composing a letter to send to DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson about the shutdown. And this is not the first time Johnson has been challenged. With the help of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Cuellar went against Johnson earlier in the year in February when the Phalanx's flight operations were reduced. Now, Cuellar is looking for reinforcements in Texas including Sen. John Cornyn and Reps. Mike McCaul and John Carter. McCaul has previously called on DHS to ※develop a strategy to gain operational control§ of the border. ※Over the last several years, Congress has provided billions of dollars to secure the borders but without an end goal in mind,§ McCaul stated. McCaul has also worked to make legislation ※to require the [DHS] secretary to gain situational awareness through the use of sophisticated technologies and others means, giving our border agents the ability to predict changes in illegal activity.§ The DHS claims the illegals coming into the U.S. have declined at the Texas stretch of the border, but apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley rose 27 percent in the fiscal 2016 year alone. In the small Laredo border section, Operation Phalanx accounted for 10,559 apprehensions and 4,007 ※turnbacks§ from March 2012 to December 2015. Phalanx was credited with seizing 12,851 pounds of narcotics during the period. The fact that Obama would do away with that just because Donald Trump won says a lot about what kind of man our outgoing president is. He would let more criminals and drugs come into this country just to make it harder to control for Trump, but Obama is not hurting Trump〞he's hurting the American people. And that's disgraceful. With Trump in office in January, however, Phalanx will be up and running once more＃ and Obama can't do anything to stop it.

    "title": "Re: Will Michelle Obama Be The Replacement Nominee If The FBI Email Investigation Ends Hillary Clinton's Campaign?",
    "text": "Archives Michael's Latest Video Will Michelle Obama Be The Replacement Nominee If The FBI Email Investigation Ends Hillary Clinton's Campaign?   30th, 2016 \nI realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre, but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen. We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. \nIn fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled ※ Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside ※＃ \nSo what should the Democrats do now? \nIf ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: \nThey would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. \nDemocrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. \nBut what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year's primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group's bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nSo if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. \nWho would they choose? \nLet's take a look at the top five options＃ \n#1 Tim Kaine \nHe would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton's running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. \nAnd at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. \nSo to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. \n#2 Joe Biden \nVice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run ＃ \nVice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. \nBiden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. \nBut according to the vice president, the short answer is ※no.§ The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. \nUnfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. \nBiden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn't have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. \nBiden would probably represent the ※safest§ choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. \n#3 Bernie Sanders \nBernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. \nFirst of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. \nSecondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. \nThirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be ※another McGovern§ and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. \nSo even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. \n#4 Elizabeth Warren \nElizabeth Warren would be very popular with the ※Bernie Sanders§ wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. \nSo she is definitely a possibility. \nBut she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as ※another McGovern§ because of her far left policies. \n#5 Michelle Obama \nOne recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. \nAnd these days Barack Obama's approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. \nSo the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. \nMichelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as ※the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign§ in a recent MSN article entitled ※ In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice ※＃ \nThe speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama's place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. \n※When you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,§ said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. ※We know she didn't like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.§ \nIf I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. \nOf course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. \nAnd I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. \nIn the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. \nAnd if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down.",

    "title": "Comment on The New York Times Calls For Obama To Support A UN Resolution That Would Divide The Land Of Israel by MaxRockatansky33",
    "text": "10 Signs That An All-Out Attempt Is Being Made To Sabotage The Trump Campaign Michael's Latest Video The New York Times Calls For Obama To Support A UN Resolution That Would Divide The Land Of Israel   October 9th, 2016 \nWhile most Americans are focused on the endless circus surrounding Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton , a drama of earth-shattering importance is playing out behind the scenes. Most people seem to assume that we don't have to be concerned about Barack Obama anymore because his second term is scheduled to end in a few months, but the truth is that an absolutely critical decision is in his hands right now. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have said that they will not support a proposed UN Security Council resolution that would formally establish a Palestinian state, that would set the parameters for the new state, and that would grant them East Jerusalem as their capital. So at this moment there is a tremendous amount of international pressure on Barack Obama to support such a resolution, because the U.S. veto power on the UN Security Council is the only thing standing in the way of formally dividing the land of Israel. I wrote about this in August , in September , and now I am writing about it again in October. If Obama is going to do this, it needs to happen by January 20th, 2017, and so for the next few months we are officially in ※the danger zone§. \nOn Thursday, the New York Times editorial board added their voice to the growing chorus of those calling for a ※parameters resolution§ in a piece entitled ※ At the Boiling Point With Israel ※＃ \nThe best idea under discussion now would be to have the United Nations Security Council, in an official resolution , lay down guidelines for a peace agreement covering such issues as Israel's security, the future of Jerusalem , the fate of Palestinian refugees and borders for both states . \nIn the article, the New York Times editorial board also strongly endorsed the U.S. State Department's recent condemnation of Israel's plan to build new housing units in the West Bank. \nI have included the official State Department statement on this matter below. Just like Barack Obama did at the UN recently , the State Department referred to Israel's presence in the West Bank as an ※occupation§＃ \nWe strongly condemn the Israeli government's recent decision to advance a plan that would create a significant new settlement deep in the West Bank. \nProceeding with this new settlement, which could include up to 300 units, would further damage the prospects for a two state solution. The retroactive authorization of nearby illegal outposts, or redrawing of local settlement boundaries, does not change the fact that this approval contradicts previous public statements by the Government of Israel that it had no intention of creating new settlements. And this settlement's location deep in the West Bank, far closer to Jordan than Israel, would link a string of outposts that effectively divide the West Bank and make the possibility of a viable Palestinian state more remote. \nIt is deeply troubling, in the wake of Israel and the U.S. concluding an unprecedented agreement on military assistance designed to further strengthen Israel's security, that Israel would take a decision so contrary to its long term security interest in a peaceful resolution of its conflict with the Palestinians. Furthermore, it is disheartening that while Israel and the world mourned the passing of President Shimon Peres, and leaders from the U.S. and other nations prepared to honor one of the great champions of peace, plans were advanced that would seriously undermine the prospects for the two state solution that he so passionately supported. \nIsraelis must ultimately decide between expanding settlements and preserving the possibility of a peaceful two state solution. Since the recent Quartet report called on both sides to take affirmative steps to reverse current trends and advance the two state solution on the ground, we have unfortunately seen just the opposite. Proceeding with this new settlement is another step towards cementing a one-state reality of perpetual occupation that is fundamentally inconsistent with Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state . Such moves will only draw condemnation from the international community, distance Israel from many of its partners, and further call into question Israel's commitment to achieving a negotiated peace. \nAs you can see on the official State Department website , that press release was issued on October 5th. \nAt the exact same time, Hurricane Matthew was rapidly gaining strength, and it ultimately became the first category 5 hurricane to form in the Atlantic since 2007. It proceeded to slam into the southeastern United States, causing billions of dollars of damage in the process. The following comes from Wikipedia ＃ \nPreparations began in earnest across the southeastern United States as Matthew approached, with several states declaring a state of emergency for either entire states or coastal counties; widespread evacuations were ordered for extensive areas of the coast. On October 6, U.S. President Barack Obama declared a federal state of emergency for Florida. [1] The federal disaster declaration was later extended to include Georgia and South Carolina. [2] In Florida, over 1 million lost power as the storm passed to the east, with 478,000 losing power in Georgia and South Carolina. \nWhen will we learn? \nFor decades the pattern has always been the same. Every time we come against Israel, the consequences are immediate and they are dramatic. \nUnfortunately, our leaders never seem to learn, and now we stand on the precipice of perhaps the biggest betrayal of Israel of all time. Here is more from the New York Times about why they believe it is important to put ※pressure§ on Israel in the form of a UN Security Council resolution＃ \nThe most plausible pressure would come from Mr. Obama's leading the Security Council to put its authority behind a resolution to support a two-state solution and offer the outlines of what that could be. That may seem like a bureaucratic response unlikely to change anything, but it is the kind of political pressure Mr. Netanyahu abhors and has been working assiduously to prevent. \nNo, such a resolution would not just be ※a bureaucratic response§. \nA UN Security Council resolution would be legally binding on both Israel and the Palestinians, and whoever is elected in November would not be able to go back and undo it. \nSuch a resolution would permanently divide the land of Israel, it would give formal UN recognition to a Palestinian state for the very first time, and it would hand East Jerusalem over to the Palestinians. \nAnd according to the Times of Israel , the UN Security Council could begin discussing these matters as soon as next Friday＃ \nThe Security Council is expected to hold a session next Friday under the official banner: ※The settlements as the obstacle to peace and a two-state solution.§ \nThe meeting, initiated by the Palestinians, is considered the opening salvo to a resolution condemning Israel for settlement activity. \nThis process could result in just a resolution condemning Israeli settlement activity, but there is also a tremendous amount of concern that Obama could use this as an opportunity to ※leave a legacy§ in the Middle East. Here is more from the Times of Israel ＃ \nIsraeli government members have been worried that Obama, before leaving office in January but after a successor is chosen in November, may seek to impose or advance a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, or at least set out parameters for how it should be solved, including through the Security Council by not using the US veto for any anti-Israel resolutions . \nAccording to a Channel 2 report Thursday, an Israeli official charged that the ※disproportionate criticism§ from Washington over the latest construction plans was ※an alibi§ to cover plans by Obama to take anti-Israel actions in the final weeks of his presidency. \nIf this happens, it will be the worst thing that Barack Obama has done during his entire time in the White House. \nWhether it is Barack Obama or someone else, the truth is that someday the U.S. government will have a major role in dividing the land of Israel, and it is one of the most important prophetic markers that we are watching for. \nBecause once the land of Israel gets divided, all hell is going to break loose in America. \nI have discussed the potential consequences for dividing the land of Israel on television , and in my new book I warn about all of the historic disasters that are coming to this nation. \nIf we get to January 20th and another president takes over and there has been no UN Security Council resolution, perhaps we can breathe a little bit of a sigh of relief. \nBut if Barack Obama does what the New York Times and so many others are urging him to do, the consequences for this country and for the world will be absolutely unimaginable. \nSo while you are keeping up with the latest insults that Trump and Clinton are hurling at one another, don't forget about Obama, because what he decides to do regarding Israel in the months ahead is going to have dramatic implications for all of us. \nAbout the author: Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream. Michael's controversial new book about Bible prophecy entitled ※The Rapture Verdict§ is available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon.com.* Russia Is Preparing For A Nuclear War With The United States ? watchmannonthewall \nLet's see: If I remember correctly, Mr. Obama's first visit to Israel came shortly after He was sworn in to begin his second term, about March of 2013. He never went there during his first term. \nHe went to Jerusalem and encouraged college students to stand up to the Prime Minister, to seek ※peace§ the way Obama wanted it done, not the way Mr. Netanyahu publically stated it needed to come about. He sent advisors to the opposition to try and prop it up to keep the PM from being able to again form a goverment when Netanyahu called for early elections, while helping Israel's enemies move right up to its borders in a number of places. He has been busy dividing the land of Israel, its people, for the last four years. Has anyone noticed he has done the same here, during the exact same period of time? Scipture says, ※Do unto others as you would have them do unto you§ and ※Love your neighbor as you love yourself.§ Those who don't care for scripture say it this way, ※What goes around, comes around.§ Either way, the outcome is the same! iris \nIt certainly appears that he has wanted Israel's demise all along. GIVVO6_B \nUnfortunately he doesn't and his Mentor Rahm Emanuel (ex Israeli soldier) would not allow it. A.S. \nIf G-f forbid, Israel is divided, I said this once and I said this again. When the Gaza expulsion happened, a day later Katrina happened. Around 10,000 Jews were lost their homes when expelled. Around 100,000 Americans lost their homes. \nThis time, it will not be 10x, but 40x. 40 is a mystical number in Judaism. It is the number that relates to punishment and repentance. The rain lasted for 40 days during the flood. Moses was up on the mount for 40 days. The Jews were walking the desert for 40 years. This time, G-d will use 40x. \nAccording to a google search: The total population of all settlements in the West Bank was nearly 400,000 in 2014, excluding East Jerusalem. As of December 2015, altogether over 800,000 Israeli Jews resided over the 1949 Armistice Lines (including east-Jerusalem neighborhoods), constituting approximately 13% of Israel's Jewish population. \nHowever, we are at the end of 2016 and I believe many people were accounted for, especially those that hold dual citizenship. I would put the number at about 1.25 million. If we take 1.25 M x 40 = 50 M. That is 50 million people that will lose their homes. So what may happen? \nCalifornia has about 50 million people. A 10.0 Earthquake could strike and destroying everything into rubble. The North East U.S. has about 50 million people. Another hurricane could strike, this time flooding everything by about 10 feet of water. The area around the New Madrid fault line has about 50 million people. The Earthquake could strike and destroy everything. Or maybe the Yellowstone volcano will erupt, burying by 10 feet of ash 1/3 of the U.S. That is way more than 50 million people, but G-d loves Israel and doesn't look at what happens from his vengeance. \nSo take your pick people. Who is willing to offer themselves to be the sacrifice? Will people in CA stand by Obama? They seem to be behind Hillary. Will people in the North East stand by Obama? They seem to be behind Hillary too! If you want to have your homes, schools, roads, malls, community, etc., then tell Obama ※NO NO NO. Dividing Israel will be the death of us.§ \nI hope Obama is listening. Because his legacy may just well be something like the state of California being turned into rubble. The North East being flooded with 10 feet of water. The midwest begin turned into rubble. 1/3 of the U.S. being buried with 10 feet of volcanic ash. How will Obama apologize for this? How will be come to the rescue? iris \nI agree with you, A.S., those who come against His chosen people and I believe that also includes those who have put their hope and trust in Yeshua of Bethlehem, will only curse themselves. It may not always be a physical torment or event, but I've lived long enough to see that hatred, arrogance and their associated behaviors, always end up destroying individuals, families, etc. He is faithful to all of His promises and His warnings are meant to be taken just as seriously. He is so much bigger than all of the theologies and doctrines man can come up with, greater than our challenges, fears, sins and sorrows. GIVVO6_B \nYou mean like the hatred shown by land stealing mass murdering Jews towards the Palestinian natives of Palestine. PK Hodges \nThe Palestinians, also known as Hamas, ISIS, Islamics, Syrian refugees, and many other names (but always Islamic by religion) are none other than ye old Canaanites. David described them in Psalm 83 (Plus allies).The ancient families who inhabited the land that God took from them because they served other gods, created ones, and not Him. He renamed this land ※The Promised Land.§ He took it and gave it to tiny Israel, His own people. This is the background. Now that we are in the very last pages of Revelation, and Jesus is coming back very, very soon (no, not someday. He's closer than someday. He's almost here.), they are back for revenge. They are the 10 horns on the Beast. These guys, these horns or kingdoms are described to John as ※was is not (Islam was not around in John's day. Neither were any other Canaanite kingdom), will be again shortly.§ I call them the One Hour Kingdom. That's what they are prophetically. They are here for one brief hour, but in that time, they will destroy wonderfully as Daniel puts it. You could say they are the Hitmen for the Beast because they have given the Beast their authority and power in exchange for the promise that they will again have a kingdom. Of course, the Beast cannot give what it doesn't have to give, but they are sure giving it a go. Don't you think? Theirs is a virtual kingdom in the devil's virtual fairytale kingdom of today, but it sure does look real, feel real and sound real. (The lie always does). Those refugees (often referred to as rapeugees) are pouring into Europe, and whereever they go, the Governments there are giving them full support. In fact, they are bending over backwards to please them: handing them money, food, clothing, the best places to live, and punishing any person who speaks against the chaos, the havoc, the riiots, the rapes, the murders that are happening in these nations. \nMeanwhile, back last year, on the last day of September 2015, two flags were symbolically raised together (united stand＃Well, okay, as united as kingdoms who love hate and hate love can be). The flags were raised over the UN building. Whose flags were they anyway? The two flags were none other than the Vatican, the small horn (smallest kingdom in the world, also known as a city-state), and Palestine (the kingdom that is a virtual kingdom for one hour). \nNest thing we know is that the world is preaching Islam even more than before. What I mean by preaching is that they are promoting it in every way, shape and form they can. Anyone that protests against Islam is called what? Islamaphobic or Zenophobic or Nazis. \nObama even gave the One Hour kingdom a big promotion in his most recent State of the Union address. Yep, they want the land god took from them back, but not by humbling themselves before the One true God and the Son He sent to save all whom call on His name. In fact, they point blank refuse to recognise the son of God as being the Son of God. No.They want to steal the land.. They want revenge. The leaders of Islam preach revenge. Tell me, if you've never had something in the first place, how could it be called as revenge? Revenge is trying to get even for something from the past. Revenge is trying to get back something that used to be yours. \nBut, are they settling for the area called the Promised Land. No, Siree. Why do that when a Caliphate, a world wide kingdom is so much bigger and better? Keep watching. The Word of God is being fulfilled and will be fulfilled to the letter. Do not believe every thing you are hearing in the world. Those guys speak with twisted mouths. Our bproblem is we've been taking the word of scientists and newsmen, the world's wisemen, as the gospel truth, and placing it above what God's Word says. Make sure you take every word, everything you hear and compare it to the what the Bible says about it. No conclusion jumping allowed. No opinions. There is only one truth. Not many versions of the truth. (Note: the Word of God is written by many men but inspired by One God who is not schizophrenic.) ※You'll shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.§ Get into the Word. Say it. Pray it. Believe it over anything you hear, see or feel. Believe it and do it (act on it, live it). And then?:Wait before the Lord. And Let Him show you what is truth and what is not. We cannot find truth in a world that is following a dragon who is the Father of lies, theories and opinions, and false predictions). God wants us to know the truth, so that we will be prepared. He will unlock His word and give us greater understanding so that we can endure in faith till the end and be saved. chief white eunuch \nYour comment is too long to read but the Islamics are descendants of Ishmael & Bible calls them wild.

JF, you probably know this, but the Brits double crossed Disraeli after he basically saved their behinds in the 1800s. All he asked for in return was a homeland for his people. He died in 1881 without that promise they made to him, being kept. Israel didn't get a homeland again until 1947, took effect in 1948. But, the Brits and others, conveniently chopped up areas of ※Palestine§, (even affected countries like Nigeria), all to do with natural resources of the countries they had overseen for so long, especially, oil (British Petroleum). I don't think they expected or probably even wanted, Israel to make it this long. I think they fully expected that the war which was instigated by surrounding Arab nations the day after Israel's statehood came into effect, would be quick and decisive. God had a different idea though, and has been fulfilling prophecy about the end times.

The earthly, anti-Christ state of Israel has no place in God's plan.

Today Christians are that people if they ※continue in His (God's) goodness.§ Rom. 11:22 . Jim Davis \nWho cares, indeed. If you care more about Israel's borders than you own country's borders, well, you might just be a cuckservative! iris \nYou cited Romans. According to Paul, and I believe the Old and New Testaments are inspired and authoritative, then if you are a Gentile Christian, you are grafted into Israel. Their olive tree bears you. If God has forsaken them, He could just as flippantly (according to your theology) forsake you, for your sin put Jesus Christ on the Cross, also. But He is faithful to His promises, and His unconditional election. According to Romans 11, He has concluded all under sin, so that He might show mercy to all. You have extrapolated in your isogesis, putting in a figurative Greek interpretation of something which is meant to be taken literally. iris \nYeshua, Jewish, also all of the apostles and the first evangelists. In Romans 11, Paul foretold of the fulfillment of prophecy which is to come, that all of Israel will someday come to faith in Him as Messiah, witnessed by Zechariah. There was much anti Semitism in place among Greeks during the 2nd century, when Supersessionism, also known as Replacement Theology, took hold. It insidiously made its way into the beginnings of the RCC, and its poison was pervasive in the European culture which influenced Luther and Calvin. That didn't make it canonical by any means. The Biblical concepts of God's love, election, grace and mercy are connected, not allegorical, not related to a flippant Greek mythological god. Yeshua still loves His people and when one dismisses them in the way that Replacement Theology does, God Himself is not only dismissed, it pierces ※the apple of His eye§. www.tomatobubble.com \nWhatever, keep on in your delusion. The Christian church is the true Israel, not the current earthly Israel. Jews can be saved by converting to Christianity, apart from that they are God's enemies. GIVVO6_B \nYeshua as you call him named the Jews as ※Whited walls, full of dead men's bones§ He also said they were of their father the Devil, who was liar and a murderer from the beginning. You don't really know anything about Christianity at all do you? It is certainly clear you do not read and understand what is written in the New Testament. carson \njohn 8:44 was summed up in john 8:42.. If God were your Father you would love Me..said Jesus. \nBut with the replacement'ers the gentiles/chinamen or those of mayan descent or south pacific islanders descent or african or anyone but jews..all get a free pass from having the devil as their father even though they too do not love Christ? Wake up and stop listening to what tickles the ears. \nalso if the church has replaced israel then joel 3:2 reads really odd..for my heritage Israel (for my heritage the church? Since you say the church/believers have replaced israel) whom they have scattered..(so the church was scattered?) and parted my land＃what? what land? the ＆land' doesn't matter per the replacement'ers theory, what land could God be talking about..etc etc. \nand romans 11:26-28..as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes, but as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers sake＃enemies for your? sake? Yet BELOVED? It's not hard to figure out when you read the whole chapter and the rest of the bible, the book of acts as another one, after Christ was hung on a cross and after He ascended keeps repeating how God is attempting to save israel/jews to that day, this is after the event of Christ supposedly shutting out israel/the jews for ever more, so if their shut out why is God still saving them in the book of acts and after and still to this day and the event/day that's coming due, that day of romans 11:26. \nit's clear the replacement'ers have it wrong just from 3 area's of verses not to mention the many more truths/verses. iris \nPerfectly said, thank you, carson. Only those who put their trust and hope in Yeshua of Bethlehem as God come in the flesh and their savior because of what He did for us on the Tree, have a reconciled relationship with God, but to reinterpret Scripture and state that God has annulled an irrevocable promise He has made, slaps Him in the face. carson \nHi iris..God bless you! \nIt's also odd and that people don't stop and think..in their youth they too walked in darkness and evil and ruined the world and ruined their surroundings, same stuff they blame only the jews for in smaller scale. And yet God had mercy and granted them faith in Christ (if indeed they be in Christ at all). iris \nAbsolutely. It amazes me that replacers have such an adamant faith in the doctrine of election, but can only apply it to themselves. I've shared your same observation about their concept of mercy; if they grasp the concept, but can't share it, that reminds me of Jesus' statement of not being forgiven if one does not forgive. White supremacy groups and radical jihadists share this same self righteous attitude against Jews and Israel, what does that say? Imo, it's a good example of a mental assent ※profession§ of Christian faith, but with no heart change; no empathy, no mercy, no love. \nIf there were a personal relationship with Him through faith in God's great grace, mercy and love, given for us all and displayed to us all by His reconciling, atoning death, and that, when we were all still His enemies, according the the very Jewish Paul, then thanksgiving, humility, awe and worship of God, would be quite evident. They would reflect Jesus and point to Him, not vaunt themselves and single out a people group for judgement and wrath according to their taken out of context understandings of Scripture. \nPerhaps they don't have much awareness of the depth of their own depravity, which ironically, replacers are also always talking about. They need to get a small glimpse of the pain they have caused their Jewish Messiah's heart by hating His people. He died on purpose for replacers, white supremacists and radical jihadists, too, however. God bless you, also, carson! carson \nHi iris, good observations and I've noticed the same, also how through many's own speech it comes out that their hearts are very much tied to this present world and it's kingdoms and as the world fails they pick up a scapegoat to blame for the worlds failing. Loving the world blinds a person and leads to scapegoating..hope they wake up to the devils snares and get free in Christ Jesus! Yep know them by their fruits. JF \nAnd he still loves his chosen people regardless of what man says. iris \nYep, He loves all people, and requires us to love Him with everything we have and are. If we really know Him, we'll love Him in return, love all people, and as we love ourselves. ※By their fruits, you shall know them§. Doesn't mean we approve or help when it comes to sinful attitudes and behaviors, but we'll love. JF \nAny real Christian recognizes our ties to Israel. Your church is definitely not a true church. The Jewish people are the ＆apple of God's eye' and God does not change his mind. www.tomatobubble.com \nRead Galatians 3:29. ※And if you are Christ's then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.§ \nThe vast majority of Jews are not in Christ and most likely never will be, so how can they still be Abraham's seed. iris \nThat verse is talking about a spiritual truth, and while you are so correct if you realize that personal faith in Messiah is tantamount, the same writer of Galatians also wrote Romans, and he stated that one day, although for now they are ※partially blinded§ to the truth, the whole nation of Israel will recognize Him as their Messiah. Then, the physical and spiritual, irrevocable promise God made to them as a people, will be manifested. He's not done with anyone, believer or not, until He calls it, and He hasn't called it. Why can't you have mercy on them, if He had mercy on you? Why can't you recognize that even now, Israel is the safest haven in the ME for Christians and other religions, including practicing Muslims, as long as they obey the n",

    "title": "Re: John Bolton Warns That Obama May Divide The Land Of Israel At The UN Before The Inauguration",
    "text": "Michael's Latest Video John Bolton Warns That Obama May Divide The Land Of Israel At The UN Before The Inauguration   20th, 2016 \nIs Barack Obama about to make the most catastrophic decision of his entire presidency? Former UN Ambassador John Bolton is warning that there is ※a lot of speculation§ over at UN headquarters right now about ※resolutions that recognize a Palestinian state or that try and set a boundary for Israel based on the 1967 ceasefire lines§. Of course this would have to happen before the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th , because Trump has already made it quite clear that he will not support any UN resolution of such nature. Knowing that Trump is about to take office, advocates of the ※two state solution§ are putting an immense amount of pressure on Obama to support a UN Security Council resolution that would permanently divide the land of Israel while he is still in the White House, and at this moment we do not know what Barack Obama's final decision will be. \nMost Americans have no idea that this drama is playing out behind the scenes, but those in the know are very much aware of what is happening. The Wall Street Journal recently published an article entitled ※ Obama's Israel Surprise? § that discussed the possibility of Obama supporting a UN Security Council resolution that would permanently divide the land of Israel, and the New York Times editorial board has formally endorsed such a resolution. \nThe rest of the UN Security Council is ready to agree to such a resolution, and at this point the only obstacle is getting Barack Obama's approval. That is why it was so exceedingly alarming to wake up on Sunday morning and read former UN Ambassador John Bolton's very chilling warning about what could soon happen at the UN. The following comes from an article on the website of The Hill ＃ \nFormer United Nations Ambassador John Bolton warned Sunday that President Obama should not take any actions before leaving office that could hurt Israel at the U.N. \nBolton said during an interview with radio host John Catsimatidis that there is ※a lot of speculation over in Turtle Bay at U.N. headquarters about resolutions that recognize a Palestinian state or that try and set a boundary for Israel based on the 1967 ceasefire lines.§ \n※I think that'd be very inadvisable for the president to do that,§ he said. \nJohn Bolton is still very tied in to the international community, and Donald Trump is reportedly actively considering asking him to serve as Secretary of State. \nNeedless to say, I would take what he is saying very, very seriously. \nSo what would this potential UN Security Council resolution look like? \nWell, it would likely accomplish three historic things＃ \n1. It would give formal UN Security Council recognition to a Palestinian state for the very first time. \n2. It would grant East Jerusalem to the Palestinians as the capital of their new state. \n3. It would establish the 1967 ceasefire lines as the basis for final negotiations for borders between the two states. \nUp until now, the U.S. government's veto power on the UN Security Council has always blocked anti-Israel resolutions from passing, but earlier this year the Obama administration said that such a ※parameters resolution§ was now ※on the table§. \nAnd at this point we still don't know what Obama is going to ultimately decide, but the Trump transition team is so concerned about this that they recently warned Obama ※against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office§ . \nBut no matter how much they object, the truth is that Trump and his team cannot actually do anything to stop Obama. \nIf Obama decides to betray Israel at the UN, it is going to happen. \nAnd of course the Israeli government is extremely concerned about what might take place as well. According to the New York Post , the Israelis asked Secretary of State John Kerry if the Obama administration would promise to veto any anti-Israel resolutions at the UN for the remainder of Obama's term, and Kerry flatly refused to make such a promise＃ \nIsrael faces a unique window of danger from Nov. 9 to Jan. 20: What might President Obama do in his final days in office to slam the Jewish state? \nStart with Secretary of State John Kerry's recent flat refusal to promise a US veto on any upcoming anti-Israel resolution in the UN Security Council . \nOn Saturday, Haaretz reports, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Kerry he's counting on Washington to stick to its policy of nixing anti-Israel resolutions. Kerry's reply: The administration has yet to make a decision on the matter . \nPerhaps equally as alarming is what Obama told the Palestinians. In October, Obama reportedly told them to wait until after the election for any action at the UN Security Council＃ \nOn the surface, the latest message to the Palestinian Authority from the Obama administration is no different from the past two decades of American policy: the U.S. will veto any resolution attacking Israel or demanding Palestinian independence without them first making peace with the Jewish state. But, as Haaretz reported , there was one significant caveat to the warning. They were told not to push for any such resolution until after the presidential election next month . \nSo why would it be so catastrophic if Obama decides to support a UN Security Council resolution that permanently divides the land of Israel? \nWell, John Kilpatrick, Shane Warren, Bob Jones and many others have warned that when we divide the land of Israel, our land will be divided too. \nWhether it is Barack Obama, Donald Trump or some other president that does it, someday this will happen. \nAnd when this happens, the floodgates will open and judgment after judgment will hit this nation. I have warned about many of these events in my latest book , and I hope to write much more about what is coming in the months ahead. \nSo right now we are in ※the danger zone§ until January 20th, 2017. \nIf we can get to January 20th and Donald Trump is peacefully inaugurated and the land of Israel has not been divided, perhaps we can all breathe a little bit easier for a while. \nBut if the land of Israel is divided between now and then, the consequences for this nation are going to be more severe than most people would dare to imagine.

I am in the ※don't know§ category. Have heard far too many preachers for 40 years proclaim this and that with no accurate results to show for it. Standing by. SurrealReality \nForget the preachers. Believe what the Bible says. Tatiana Covington \nIt's just a plot of ground. I've never seen what the BFD is about it.

Much better rainfall and way better beaches. ted j GayVet ;) \nDear Clueless with and opinion, Sometimes all it takes is for someone to open their mouth just to show how ignorant they are＃thanks for proving that it's still a relavent statement! Rusty Nale \n※I will also gather all nations, And bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; And I will enter into judgment with them there On account of My people, My heritage Israel, Whom they have scattered among the nations; They have also divided up My land.§ Joel 3:2 live in the light \nI agree, if president Obama decides to support or refuse to veto a united nations resolution to divide Israel then it will be very catastrophic. We have had people in our church years ago about fifteen years ago and some longer that saw in dreams and visions of a tsunami hitting the east coast and gulf of Mexico with water going all the way to the Rockies of northern new Mexico and Colorado and then coming down. The south was almost completely gone and all of east Texas from Dallas East and Louisiana was completely gone except a few islands there and in parts of east Texas where there was higher ground. I don't know if those dreams and visions were from the president betraying Israel but it was something they saw. One sister dreamed a huge asteroid hit the trans Atlantic ridge in the Atlantic ocean and when it did it shook the whole earth and the oceans moved back and forth like when someone sits down to fast in a bathtub. She said the devastation was beyond belief but then again I don't know if it was related to this event or not. live in the light \nI'm sorry I meant the ※mid-Atlantic§ ridge.",

Worse still, there may be reason to suspect he was fed the question in advance and gave a premeditated, Machiavellian answer. \nWhile talking to actress and rapper Gina Rodriguez on the Latin-oriented YouTube channel MiTu, Obama was asked, ※Many of the millennials, dreamers, undocumented, um, citizens 〞 and I call them citizens because they contribute to this country 〞 are fearful of voting. So if I vote, will immigration know where I live? Will they come for my family and deport us?§ Here was Obama's answer (video below): \nNot true.

    "text": "Around 300 civilians were killed in eleven airstrikes conducted by the US-led coalition in Syria, which Amnesty International investigated for its latest report. Amnesty says the US must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against Islamic State.\nAmnesty suspects that US Central Command (CENTCOM), which directs coalition airstrikes in Syria, a?may havea? carried out unlawful attacksa? in Syria , failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings.\na?We fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,a? said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty Internationala?s Beirut regional office.\na?Ita?s high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. Independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public.a?\nAmnesty investigated evidence, including eyewitness accounts, reports by human rights organizations and the media, photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery, related to 11 suspected coalition attacks in Syria. The group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as 300 civilian lives. So far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by CENTCOM.\nThe report published on Wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action a?could be as high as 600 or more than 1,000a? since the operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) started in Syria in 2014.\nOne of the strikes investigated by Amnesty took place in the early hours of December 7, 2015. The attacks hit two houses in the village of Ayn al-Khan, near al-Hawl in al-Hasakah governorate in northern Syria, killing 40 civilians, including 19 children, and injuring at least 30 others, the report said.\nAccording to an eyewitness account, an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship, which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors.\na?At this point I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop hima? I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved mea? My mother, aunt, wife and children a※ a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who Ia?d rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,a? the survivor said.\nThe strike is believed to have targeted IS fighters. But local Kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area.\nAmnesty said CENTCOMa?s failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in Syria, as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq, poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of Mosul, Iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from IS. The US-led coalition is providing air support for the offensive.\na?Given the likely increase in air strikes by the US-led Coalition as part of the Iraqi offensive to recapture Mosul, it is even more pressing that CENTCOM be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians. And it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure,a? said Maalouf.\nA similar operation to capture Manbij, Syria, which is far smaller than Mosul, killed more than 200 civilians, Amnesty estimated.\nMeanwhile, US State Department spokesman John Kirby said that the US a?takes seriously all credible allegations of civilian casualties.a?\na?Pentagon has a fairly comprehensive system for analyzing themselves what these allegations are and then, when they feel that they want further investigation, they do it. And unlike any other military in the world, they actually release the results of these investigations. And unlike any other military in the world, if the hold people accountable for their actions they [bring them to justice] too,a? Kirby said during the press briefing on Wednesday.\nAt the same time, he said that the Department of State is not aware of the Amnestya?s report about the US Central Command (CENTCOM) strikes in Syria and suggested contacting the Pentagon for that matter. He also welcomed the Amnestya?s a?inputa? and stressed that a?no military tries harder than the US military to limit, to prevent casualties to civilians or damage to civilian infrastructure.a?\na?We are not at all afraid to receive criticism about our efforts,a? Kirby added.\nThe 300 fatalities are those that Amnesty considers credible, but the number is likely around 900, the reporta?s author, Neil Sammonds, told RT. He said that while there were some indications that the Pentagon would try to improve the targeting of its strikes in Syria, so far this hasna?t happened.\na?Until now the big picture in Syria is that they are not investigating thoroughly enough, they are not aware as they should be of the amount of civilians they have killed, and it means that it is quite possible that they will be killing more civilians in their campaign to retake Mosul from Islamic State.a?\nHe added that Amnesty was focusing on other parties in the Syrian conflict, including the Syrian government, Russia, terrorist groups and armed rebels, who, he said, are responsible for more civilian deaths than the US-led coalition, which explains why the report didna?t come sooner.\nLast week, Amnesty International blasted Russia for civilian deaths in Aleppo. The Syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups, including the Al-Qaeda offshoot Al-Nusra Front. Russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city, derailing several attempts by Russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city.\nSource",

[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\nAccording to a Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) addendum to this MoFA ※urgent action§ report, the FBI was able to recover all of Hillary Clinton's once secret emails from the computer shared by her campaign vice chairman Huma Abedin and sexual deviant husband Anthony Weiner〞 both of whom are now under the protection of the FBI as ※cooperating witnesses§ against Hillary Clinton.\nTo exactly how all of Hillary Clinton's secret emails and documents ended up on the Abedin-Weiner laptop computer, the SVR explains, was due to its use of the Outlook and IMAP email protocols that will sync any folder, on any device, they are told to monitor and can be told to make local copies of emails 〞which simply means that Abedin used the laptop computer she shared with her disgraced husband to back up every communication Hillary Clinton ever made〞and that numbered 650,000 copies of emails, documents and other communications .\nUnbeknownst, however, to both Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, and everyone else aiding their criminality, this report continues, is that when the US Congress ordered all of these secret emails turned over to them, Clinton, in turn, ordered them all destroyed 〞but with her, and those aiding her, failing to realize that when these emails were ※bleached§ (a computer program used to destroy hard drives) from her secret private server they did so with it offline, meaning that it wasn't able to ※backtrack§ to the Abedin-Weiner laptop to destroy all of the backups emails, documents and communications discovered by the FBI .\nThough the exact contents of these now discovered Hillary Clinton secret emails it is not fully ※known/understood§ by the SVR, this report notes, the FBI agents who have been documenting their contents have become so horrified by what they're discovering they are now reporting to the American press that Hillary Clinton is the ※antichrist personified§ .\nEven worse, this report continues, with new Wikileaks showing that not only is Hillary Clinton and her criminal money laundering organization, known as the Clinton Foundation, being investigated by the FBI, nearly every other US intelligence and tax agency have, likewise, begun investigations too .\nThus leading, this report gravely explains, to a complete breakdown in the rule of law in the United States as the main investigators into Hillary Clinton's crimes are all now known to be her supporters who have received tens-of-millions of dollars in ※gifts/bribes§ to protect her 〞and that led former CIA agent and American diplomat Dr. Steve Pieczenik to personally notify President Putin this past week that the US intelligence community has now launched a counter-coup against Hillary Clinton .\n\nThis report concludes by noting that not only did Dr. Pieczenik take the extraordinary ※measure/step§ of informing President Putin of this US intelligence community counter-coup, he also posted his warning to YouTube for all of the American people to see too〞but that in spite of its extraordinarily being viewed by over 2.5 million of these peoples in less than 24 hours , the Hillary Clinton supporting global tech giant Google has suppressed this fact from its main trends〞 giving the top place, instead, to a video mocking Americans that has only 1.6 million views , and that stunningly doesn't include Dr. Pieczenik's warning video at all .\nSource",

[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\nAccording to this report, the practice of President Obama selling American government positions was first raised in 2013 by US diplomats who publically cried foul over this massive bribery scheme 〞and that hacked emails and documents proved was widespread, including bribes to become everything form ambassadors to assistant attorneys in the Justice Department .\nTo the largest known bribe to President Obama for a US government position though, this report continues, MoF banking regulators discovered in a Citibank Kazakhstan numbered (secret) account originally holding $20 million linked to the American leader by transfers made from it to his ※personal/private§ JPMorgan Chase account .\nTo how this discovery was made, this report notes, was through a MoF banking examination of the Republic of Kazakhstan who is seeking to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( AIIB ) that the Federation is the third largest shareholder in after China and India .\nDuring the MoF's examination of the Kazakhstan banking system on behalf of the AIIB, this report explains, a ※mysterious/suspicious§ numbered (secret) account (that originally held $20 million) was discovered at Citibank Kazakhstan in the name of a private American entity (not a non-profit) called the Haiti Development Fund LLC that was created by the Clinton Foundation criminal money laundering organization and was solely funded by Canadian mining mogul Frank Giustra and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim with the money being ※channeled/funneled§ through the Clinton-Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada).\nFrank Giustra, this report explains, is one of Hillary Clinton's main supporters who, so far, has given her over $100 million as well allowing her to use of one of his private luxury jets , while Carlos Slim has, likewise, pledged to give her $100 million 〞and who just months prior to Clinton announcing her run for the US presidency, in 2015, became the majority owner of the New York Times that throughout this American election cycle has turned this once internationally respected newspaper into nothing more than a Donald Trump ※destruction machine§ with it even shockingly admitting ※ that because Trump says things that are rude, politically incorrect, or debatable, and ※conducting his campaign in ways we've not normally seen,§ there is no need for news reporters to treat him to objective reporting §.\nWith the Carlos Slim's New York Times being the beginning of the ※ vast leftist echo chamber § created to defeat Donald Trump, this report says, its nearly all untrue articles about him are able to be parroted by hundreds of other news sites while at the same time ignoring the vast criminality of Hillary Clinton〞and that due to Wikileaks the Clinton campaign has been forced to admit, including Hillary Clinton illegally accepting millions in bribes from radical Islamic countries , and a staggering internal Clinton Foundation document admitting that it is not a charity, but a ※political operation§ that has broken the law .\nEqually as stunning to the self admitting facts that the Clinton Foundation is corrupt, this report continues, has been Carlos Slim's New York Times keeping from the American people the shocking truth relating to Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta's pedophilia〞and as evidenced by his home being filled with paintings, photos and sculptures of naked teenager children, and that the Washington Post attempted to cover up , but whose original story about this abhorrent crime against children can still be viewed online .\nAnd as if Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta's pedophilia isn't enough to shock normal human senses, this report says, Carlos Slim's New York Times covering up his fascination with human cannibalism is equally as concerning as new Wikileaks documents have revealed his satanic occult relationship with it is called ※Spirit Cooking§ whose sickening rituals include the use of blood, semen and breast milk .\nThough the MoF does note that the current war being waged by the FBI against Hillary Clinton ( and as we've previously reported on ) is, indeed, justified , this report concludes, their leaking to the New York Post elements of a Federation investigation isn't〞and that led Prime Minister Medvedev earlier today to state that relations between Russia and the United States ※ have now hit rock bottom §.\nSource",

    "title": "Obama Tells ILLEGALS to Go Out and Vote - SHOCK VIDEO",
    "text": "A NEW SHOCKING VIDEO is now leaving everyone stunned. Watch and see for yourself! Barack Obama is now openly calling on illegal aliens to vote in Tuesday's election so they can help Hillary Clinton.\nNo one in the media is making a big scandal of out this! Let's say the vast majority of those illegal immigrants would vote for Trump, would the media create a big scandal out of it then? Of course they would! What's even more shocking is that this interview was conducted on November 4th, 2 days ago so we only learned about it now. The media is trying to hide this damning interview where Obama is openly calling on people to break the law!\nObama said when you vote you become a citizen! What the hell is wrong this guy?\nReporter: Many dreamers and undocumented are scared to vote, can they vote?\nObama: When you vote you become a citizen and no one will investigate you!\nImagine yourself going to Japan or South Africa to vote in their elections, what the hell is this a banana republic?\nIt is over folks this just shows how desperate the establishment is. Its either Trump or revolution. The American people can not accept the results of a stolen election where millions of illegals were allowed to vote.\nThis whole lawless administration is lies at every turn, Obamacare, Benghazi, Hillary's private server and emails and now they are calling on illegal aliens to vote. This is the last chance the American people have to save their country and frankly the entire world. If Hillary wins now, Republicans would never stand a chance because she will bring tens of millions of more illegals who would always vote for Democrats.\nObama even has a website for illegals where he is teaching them how to vote: iwillvote.com\nGina Rodriguez asked Obama: \n※Many of the millennials, dreamers, undocumented, uhhh ＆citizens' and I call them ＆citizens' cause they contribute to this country are fearful of voting, so if I vote, will immigration know where I live, will they come for my family and deport us?§\nBarack Obama then answered: \n※Not true! And the reason is, first of all when you vote, you are a citizen yourself and there is not a situation where the voting rolls are somehow transferred over and people start investigating, etc. The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential in terms of who you voted for. If you have a family member who maybe is undocumented, then you have an even greater reason to vote.§\nNeil Cavuto of Fox Business was first to bring this video to the public on a major TV station, so we are eternally grateful about it because without him we wouldn't have known that the Obama regime is planning to allow and not go after illegals voting in these elections!\nThere is no way in hell they can freaking spin this one out",

    "title": "Trump Would Have Beaten Obama in 2012",
    "text": "Ita?s easy to glance at Tuesdaya?s popular vote a§ which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 a※ and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated.\nWhile she underperformed relative to Obamaa?s 2012 totals in several Midwestern states a§ Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin a§ Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. Whata?s more, she far surpassed Obamaa?s 2012 vote total in Florida, the countrya?s biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it.\nWhich brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college.\nThe math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nationa?s most critical battleground states.\nLeta?s look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals arena?t yet final because not all precincts have reported.\nFLORIDA a§ 29 EVs a§ 98 percent reporting \nObama 2012: 4,235,270\nClinton 2016: 4,485,745\nRomney 2012: 4,162,081\nTrump 2016: 4,605,515\nConclusion: Trump beats Obama by some 370,000 votes and wins Florida. (Note: Clinton herself won 250,000 more votes in Florida than Obama did in 2012.)\nPENNSYLVANIA a§ 20 EVs a§ 97 percent reporting \nObama 2012: 2,907,448\nClinton 2016: 2,844,705\nRomney 2012: 2,619,583\nTrump 2016: 2,912,941\nConclusion: Trump squeezes past Obama by a margin of some 5,000 votes and wins Pennsylvania. (Note: Clinton runs about 60,000 votes behind Obama, but woulda?ve had more than enough to defeat Romney in 2012.)\nOHIO a§ 18 EVs a※ 94 percent reporting \nObama 2012: 2,697,260\nClinton 2016: 2,317,001\nRomney 2012: 2,593,779\nTrump 2016: 2,771,984\nConclusion: Trump edges Obama by roughly 75,000 votes and wins Ohio. (Note: Clintona?s worst battleground state showing was Ohio, winning 380,000 [!] fewer votes than Obama.)\nStop right there and crunch the numbers: Florida (29) + Pennsylvania (20) + Ohio (18) = 67 EVs.\nRomney finished with 206 EVs. By protecting all of those, and then taking 67 from Obama, Trump would hit 273 and win the presidency.\nThe question: Did Trump 2016 defeat Obama 2012 in all of the states Romney won? Yes. Herea?s a look at the competitive ones:\na※ NORTH CAROLINA (98 percent reporting): Trump 2,339,603 a? Obama 2,178,388\na※ ARIZONA (73 percent reporting): Trump 947,284 a? Obama 930,669\na※ GEORGIA (93 percent reporting): Trump 2,068,623 a? Obama 1,761,761\na※ UTAH (78 percent reporting): Trump 360,634 a? Obama 229,463\nA review of the Romney 2012 states confirms that Trump, in this hypothetical matchup, would have carried every single one against Obama.\nIt doesna?t matter that Obama would have trounced Trump by nearly 300,000 votes in Michigan; by more than 200,000 in Wisconsin; by 175,000 in Virginia; and by 160,000 in Colorado. Ita?s similarly meaningless that Obama would have narrowly defeated Trump in Iowa, Nevada, and New Hampshire. The 44th president carried all of those states in 2012, and in this hypothetical contest, he would successfully defend all of them. But it wouldna?t be enough.\nThe electoral college would produce a razor-thin margin: Trump 273, Obama 265.\nAgain, this is an apples-to-oranges exercise. Ita?s impossible to know how the Obama campaign might have targeted certain voters in a contest against Trump, or whether Trump would have the same success in the three big battleground states against a more formidable opponent. But thata?s not the point here; the point is that ita?s not entirely fair to blame Clinton for depressing Democratic turnout when she ran even with him in five of the countrya?s most competitive states and ahead of him in a sixth, Florida, the single biggest swing state a§ and still lost the electoral college.\nSource",

    "title": "Comment on ObamaCare fallout: As premiums rise, so does cost to taxpayers by Glenn47",
    "text": "Going as planned . \nFrom Fox News : The Obama administration is trying to calm the panic over soaring ObamaCare premiums by pointing to subsidies many will receive to offset the cost 〞 but analysts and GOP lawmakers counter that those subsidies nevertheless will stick taxpayers with a rising bill. \nWith enrollment set to begin Nov. 1, the administration announced Monday that premiums are set rise an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market. Some states, such as Arizona, will see premiums jump by as much as 116 percent. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services officials are stressing that subsidies provided under the law, which are designed to rise alongside premiums, will insulate most customers from sticker shock. \nBut the rising cost of subsidies, which already totals tens of billions a year, would be passed on to the taxpayer. \n※Taxpayers are already in for a lot,§ Tom Miller, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told FoxNews.com. ※The cost doesn't go away, it just goes into someone else's pocket.§ \nIn a March report , the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that subsidies given to enrollees in 2016 would amount to $43 billion in 2016, and predicted the cost would rise to $106 billion by 2026 . It also said that over 10 years, ObamaCare provisions would reduce the deficit thanks to tax provisions and cuts to Medicare. That was before the latest announcement by the administration. It's unclear how exactly the looming premium hikes will affect that picture, though Republicans are now seeking new estimates. \nAnalysts say it's safe to assume taxpayer costs will rise. Miller noted that HHS reported an average subsidy of $291 per month in 2016. A 25 percent increase in premiums would theoretically translate into an extra $73 per month, or about $870 a year per person. \n※If you assume conservatively that there's 10 million people getting subsidies, that's an extra $8.5 billion in extra costs taxpayers are getting hit by going into next year,§ he said. \nOther experts warned this is likely to continue as long as premiums keep rising. ※Its real simple, premiums are going up and up, and subsidies are going to go up with them,§ Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former CBO director, told FoxNews.com. \nThe Department for Health and Human Services, when asked for comment by FoxNews.com, noted that the law's coverage provisions are set to cost 28 percent less in 2019 than the CBO originally projected, amounting to about $49 billion less than originally predicted when the law was signed in 2010. A spokesman also said the same office predicted that repealing the law would increase the deficit by approximately $350 billion over 10 years. \nHoltz-Eakin urged caution on the administration's analysis. ※It's been a mixed pattern, because the enrollments haven't been what they expected so it hasn't been as big of an impact financially,§ he said. ※The bad news is that spending per person is much higher than anticipated due to subsidy increases because of premium hikes.§ \nOne of the biggest ObamaCare costs to taxpayers has been absorbed into the Medicaid budget, paid for by both state and federal governments. As a sweetener to get states to go along with the plan, the federal government offered to pick up the cost of expanding Medicaid eligibility up to 133 percent of the poverty line. That siphoned low income 〞 and expensive 每 customers away from ObamaCare exchanges, seemingly contributing to its current solvency. But that cost 每 in the hundreds of billions 〞 also is borne by taxpayers. \nThe CBO projected in 2013 that, in part due to ObamaCare, federal Medicaid spending would more than double over the next 10 years , topping $554 billion by 2023. State governments pay another $160 billion toward Medicaid. ※Volume has been greater in Medicaid, and per person costs have been much higher than expected,§ Edmund Haislmaier, senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told FoxNews.com. \nSensing a spike in taxpayer costs, the Republican-led House Committee on Energy and Commerce has written to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demanding how much taxpayer money will be spent subsidizing the cost of rising premiums. \n※While the Administration continues to focus on premium ＆affordability,' it ignores the undeniable fact that federal taxpayers are subsidizing these premium increases through tax credits,§ the letter from Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., says. ※The Committee is concerned that the federal taxpayer continues to bear the burden of subsidizing the growing cost of health care insurance.§ \nThe committee is demanding estimates of the amount of money spent covering rising premiums by Nov. 7. \nDCG",

    "text": "Posted on July 4, 2014 by Dr. Eowyn | 37 Comments \nYesterday, after officiating at a wedding of two sodomites in New York, comedienne Joan Rivers outed the president and first lady of the United States as a homosexual and transgender, respectively. (See Steve's post here .) \nRivers was asked by an off-camera reporter: ※Do you think the country ＃ United States will see the first gay president or first woman president?§ \nThis is what Joan Rivers said, sounding weary and definitely not in a joking mood: \n※We already have [the first gay president] with Obama, so let's just calm down. You know Michelle is a tranny＃ a transgender. We all know. ※ We all know. \nOf course, by ※we,§ Joan Rivers wasn't referring to ordinary American people, aka the sheeple who pay the taxes that (barely) holds the U.S. government together, who pay the movie tickets that maintain the Hollyweirdos in their extravagant and debauched ※lifestyle§. \nSo who are those ※we§ who ※all know§ all along that Obama is ※gay§ and his ※wife§ Michael 〞 oops, Michelle 〞 is really a man? Clue No. 1 \nRemember that Newsweek cover of May 21, 2012, proclaiming Obama to be ※The First Gay President§? \nNewsweek ＆s orgasmic cover was prompted by Obama's reversal of the military's long-standing ※don't ask don't tell§ policy and his open support of ※gay marriage.§ \nThe weekly magazine's accompanying cover story was written by the political pundit Andrew Sullivan, a public (i.e., outed) homosexual who wrote that Obama's support of gay marriage had brought him to tears. (Lest you get all misty-eyed sentimental, he's the same Andrew Sullivan who once said ※gay marriage§ does NOT mean monogamy. As he put it oh so delicately : ※there is more likely to be greater understanding of the need for extramarital outlets between two men than between a man and a woman.§) \nAt the time, we the sheeple thought Newsweek didn't literally mean Obama is ※the first gay president§. \nThink again. \nHomosexuals pride themselves on their gaydar. They have to, in order to find each other because homosexuals constitute only 3% of the U.S. population, according to the Williams Institute , UCLA's LGBT research think tank. That means Andrew Sullivan already knew Barack Hussein Obama is a homosexual, just as another public homosexual 〞 conservative blogger Kevin Dujan of HillBuzz 〞 has known all along. Clue No. 2 \n7 months after the Newsweek cover, Candy 〞 the first transexual style magazine 〞 caused a brief publicity stir when it chose for its cover a transgender model, Connie Fleming, bearing a decided resemblance to Michelle Obama. (See DCG's post about this here .) \nIn the words of Daily Mail : ※A striking transgender model made up to look like Michelle Obama being sworn into office has been put on the front cover of a U.S. magazine＃. Fleming is dressed in typical First Lady fashion, down to the pearl necklace. Even the hair style is reminiscent of President Barack Obama's wife, Michelle. § \nFor Candy to do a cover story on a transgender U.S. president is bold enough, why pick a BLACK male-to-female transgender for its cover? And not just any black MtF transgender but one who resembles Michelle? Then have the model wear a wig just like Michelle's and a sleeveless dress just like Michelle's, exposing Fleming's toned muscular arms, of which Michael Obama is so proud and for which he is celebrated by all the Obama idolators in the MSM? Clue No. 3 \nFast forward 1? years to Time magazine's cover of June 9, 2014, proclaiming that we're at a ※Transgender Tipping Point: America's Next Civil Rights Frontier.§ (See my post, ※ Transgender surgery now covered by bankrupt Medicare ※.) \nFor its cover picture, Time could have chosen any number of transgenders 〞 male-to-female or female-to-male; white, black, yellow, brown. \nBut the magazine chose a BLACK male-to-female transgender, an obscure actor named Laverne Cox who also bears an uncanny resemblance to Michelle Obama. As observant FOTM commenter motherbarbarian noted: ※Looking at that Time cover photo, I am reminded of Michael Obama. Same sculpted arms and muscled legs.§ \nWink, wink. Nudge, nudge. \nFriends, we've been played. \n※We all know.§ They all know. \nJoan Rivers, Andrew Sullivan, Newsweek , Candy , Time , and all the denizens of the ※liberal§ media and Hollywood have known all along. \nSee our posts:",

I knew we were headed towards communism when the American electorate chose Clinton, not once, but twice. I knew because I'd gone to high school with Bill Clinton's wife, Hillary Clinton, and I knew her politics. It frightened me, but I thought we could recover. With the election of Obama, not once, but twice, we are now truly a communist nation. There are barely any threads of the Republic left to grab onto and the nation still sleeps. If we don't awaken the ※sleeping giant§ soon, the Gulags of Russia will become an American reality. KJLN \nA Russian government official bragged that Barack Obama was a KGB operative and that his presidency had been planned since birth, an American physicist and government contractor reports. Tom Fife, an American computer networking specialist and international businessman, reported the alarming facts about the Kremlin's connection to Barack Obama. The boast from a Communist Party official reportedly occurred during a business trip to Russia,16 years before Barack Obama was ushered into the presidency of the United States. ※It was like an elastic band snapping all the way from 1992,§ Fife shakily admitted, upon recall of the exact moment he realized the Communist official had been telling the truth. \n※It was a very, very scary feeling.§ \nFife, a physicist and computer engineer, had been traveling to Russia for a joint venture with a state-owned company when the shocking revelation was revealed to him. After several business meetings, Fife and his partner were invited to the company owner's home at the end of the journey for a farewell dinner. \nThe owner's wife was a Communist Party official and was ※climbing two ladders§, as Fife puts it, one ladder being the KGB and the other being the traditional Russian society and business ladder. As the evening wore on, the female Communist official became increasingly agitated over a perceived slight and her emotions spilled over. \n※You Americans like to think you're so perfect!§ she snarled. ※Well, what if I told you that very, very soon you're going to have a black president＃ and he's going to be a Communist!§ \nThe KGB operative was not finished. As she had now dropped this bombshell on the entire gathering, she felt compelled to continue. \n※His name is Barack,§ she sneered. ※His mother is white and his father is an African black. He has gone to the best schools, he is what you would call ＆Ivy League'.§ \nFife recalls being stunned and shocked at the words flowing from the Communist's mouth as she continued to rattle off an incredibly precise set of details about this Communist operative who was to supposedly become president of the United States. \nThe Communist official then stated that he was from Hawaii, but would very soon be elected to the Chicago state legislature. This has turned out to be an eerily prescient prediction, as Barack Obama was not elected State Senator until 1996, a full 4 years afterwards, as he took Alice Palmer's seat. \nIn 1992, Obama had recently graduated from Harvard Law School and accepted a position as a Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School. Perhaps the most shocking revelation is how deep the Soviet Communist network has embedded itself into American political and educational culture. A quick review of Obama's political ※career§ shows a track that was inexplicably greased, from his tuition payments at Columbia and Harvard, to a position at UOC Law School, to his eventual electoral ※victories§ at the Illinois State Senate, United States Senate, and U.S. Presidency. \nBarack Obama's parents ostensibly met in a Russian language class. This could have been where his mother was recruited by Barack Obama Sr, who could have already been working undercover for the KGB. In order to brainwash the child from an early age, they surrounded him with diehard Communists and fellow KGB agents, such as Frank Marshall Davis, a known Communist Party USA official. The Soviet KGB directly funded the CPUSA. This would fit directly into what the Russian Communist said about ＆Barack', boasting ※He has been raised to be an atheist and a communist.§ \n※He will be a blessing for world communism,§ Fife recalled her saying, after getting over the initial shock of hearing the current president was a KGB agent. The creepy prediction stayed with the physicist upon his return to the United States, although he paid it no mind until he began to hear of a swiftly rising political star named Barack Obama. When Fife learned that this same Barack was running in the2008 presidential election, everything snapped into place and he knew he had to tell someone. Today, Fife admits that it deeply disturbs him and that he has never been able to shake the ominous feeling of foreboding about what comes next, now that the KGB official's prediction has come true. \n※It never leaves you, having someone tell you that they've engineered the takeover of your country,§ he admits. ※It's really quite scary.§ \nSee also Dr. Eowyn's May 24, 2010's post on this, ※ Obama, A Sleeper Agent For World Communism .§ Rate this:",

    "text": "Posted on April 26, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 21 Comments \nObama recently was in London, lecturing the Brits against Brexit, their upcoming referendum on leaving the European Union, which deservedly got him a stinging rebuke from London mayor Boris Johnson. \nIn an op/ed for The Sun , Johnson recalls that in 2009 when Obama took over the White House, he removed a bust of Winston Churchill that had been in the Oval Office. Johnson writes: \n※Some said it was a snub to Britain. Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan President's ancestral dislike of the British empire 每 of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender.§ \nBy the way, in 2012 the Obama Administration first denied removing the bust, calling the story ※100 per cent false§ 〞 that the bust is still in the White House, but simply moved to Obama's private residence. Later, however, the Obama White House admitted that the Churchill bust in the President's residence is a different bust, and that the original one had indeed been removed. (Source: Independent ) \nWhile in London, in a townhall meeting on April 23, the POS also badmouthed North Carolina on barring so-called ※transgenders§ from using the restroom of their fancy instead of in accordance with their biology. That means, if NC's lunatic critics have their way, the state will be forced to let fully biological males with a penis to use a girl's restroom. \nIn the course of his hectoring on transgenders' right to use the bathroom of their choice, Obama also extolled same-sex marriage and attributed his change of stance to his daughters, Malia and Sasha. Then he said something very curious. \nAs reported and transcribed verbatim by The Huffington Post : \nThe president said that he initially didn't think the labels for same-sex couples really mattered as long as they had the same rights as heterosexuals. Sasha and Malia helped him see why that wasn't the case. \n※I have to confess my children generally had an impact on me ,§ he said during a town hall in London. ※ People I loved who were in monogamous same-sex relationships explained to me what I should have understood earlier, which is it was not simply about legal rights but about a sense of stigma, that if you're calling it something different it means that somehow it means less in the eyes of society.§ \nI found the full video of the townhall meeting of hundreds of young ※useful idiots§ drinking in the POS's words. This is what Obama said on same-sex marriage, beginning at the 40:13 mark: \n※On marriage equality, I was in favor of so-called civil unions. My notion was initially that labeling those partnerships as marriage wasn't necessary as long as people were getting the same rights, and it would disentangle them from some of the religious connotations that marriage had for lots of Americans. And that's where I think ＃ now, I have to confess, my children generally had an impact on me, people I loved who were in monogamous same-sex relationships explained to me what I should have understood earlier , which is it was not simply about legal rights but about a sense of stigma, that if you're calling it something different it means that somehow it means less in the eyes of society.§ \nBrian Anderson of DownTrend.com writes: \nMaybe that's just the worst segue ever, but right after he says his children helped him on the issue he says these people that he loves were in gay sexual relationships. He doesn't say his daughters and other people that he loves convinced him to support gay marriage, just that his daughters did. The entire point that he's trying to make is that Sasha and Malia were the ones that help him arrive at his opinion on the matter. \nI've read that thing a dozen times and I can't come up with any other interpretation. Obama is saying that his daughters, who are in ※monogamous same-sex relationships,§ are the ones that convinced him to support same sex marriage. If he was talking about anyone else, he would have put that in, but he didn't. \nWhat makes this really disturbing is that Obama changed his position on gay marriage in 2012. Malia would have 14 years old and Sasha only 11 . What we are left with is that Obama is claiming his young daughters, one who was pre-pubescent, were in committed gay sexual relationships. \nI found photos of Sasha Obama, 14, with a boy , allegedly her date to her high school's homecoming last October. I could find no reports of Malia, now 17, going on a date or having a boyfriend. \nH/t FOTM ＆s Glenn47",

    "text": "November 20, 2016 - Fort Russ News - \n\n-  902.gr , translated by Tom Winter - \n\n\n\"Behind the fiestas and the photo ops, Mr Obama, you came unwanted and you left unwanted\" said the statement of the Federation of Greek Women on the visit of the US President. The statement criticizes the fact that Barack Obama \"pronounced benedictions to our \"left\" prime minister for \"reforms that bled the Greek people\" and notes that \"the US has a major share of responsibility for the massacre, not only of our own people, but also the peoples of the world.\" Details of the Communication: Mr. Obama came to Greece reading beautiful words ... He came equipped with \"mirrors for the natives\" with shameless and cheap flattery for the sacrifices of the Greek people and with an Ode to Democracy 'made in Greece' dripping from his lips. The outgoing US president had good words for our \"left\" prime minister for the \"reforms\" that bled the Greek people, apparently recognizing in Mr. Tsipras a kindred spirit (albeit at a lower level). He certainly avoided telling us that the \"democracy,\" he so often mentioned has proved most convenient for exploiters of our toil.  It is the \"democracy\" soaked through in child poverty and misery.  It is the \"democracy\" of refugees and wars, the \"democracy\" of imperialist interventions from Ukraine to the Middle East and Africa.  It is the \"democracy\" of the employers' terrorism, labor flexibility, one job for each two and three employees.  It is the \"democracy\" that has many living on crumbs or the soup kitchens, while a trillion. euro of capital is concentrated in Greece on our slaving, and still looking to find where to invest to give more profits to monopoly groups.   It is the \"democracy\" that supports an alliance of wolves and a mutual extermination system.  This is the \"democracy\" concealed in the pat words of Mr. Obama And, of course, he shoved under the carpet what the Greek people know well, but that our Greek Prime Minister preferred to \"forget:\" that the US has a major share of responsibility for the massacre, not only of our own people, but also people of all the world, rapidly now extending to every corner of the globe.  No family woman should fall into their snare! We, the women of the radical women's movement do not want, and can not be fooled by, the supposed gifts that the former \"President of the World\" came to offer us. We are the first to know that the famous egalitarianism of \"democracy\" he praised us for does not mean equality of standing! Instead, it is the most deceptive wrapping of our occupational and social inequity. We, the women of daily toil not accept the lure of supposedly \"democratic\" and \"peaceful\" declarations serving only the imperialist plans in our region and creating an immediate danger to our lives and future. We, the women who participate in associations and groups of IAHS have had enough fine words from wherever they come from.   We will not succumb to the deadly lullaby of false hope and insidious complacency. We constantly exhibit with our participation in the daily struggle our desire for a life without exploitation and oppression, without wars, and without their attendant refugees.

    "title": "Obamacare Premiums Spike an Average of 25%!",
    "text": "Print \nSome worrisome news is breaking across the nation where most Americans are now preparing to deal with a major spike in their already astronomical healthcare costs. The AP is reporting that healthcare premiums are about to rise an average of 25% across the country, even as many American families are already struggling to pay their current premiums. \nPremiums will go up sharply next year under President Barack Obama's health care law, and many consumers will be down to just one insurer, the administration confirmed Monday. That's sure to stoke another ※Obamacare§ controversy days before a presidential election. \nBefore taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less. \nMoreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles. \n※Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period,§ said Larry Levitt, who tracks the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \nFox News took the time on Monday to hammer House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for her lies that Obamacare would make it easier for most Americans to get healthcare and that it would keep prices more ※affordable.§ \nPelosi's definition of affordable seems to be the exact opposite of what it actually means, because instead of slowing our rising healthcare costs, prices have actually been climbing higher, faster ! \nAdministration officials are stressing that subsidies provided under the law, which are designed to rise alongside premiums, will insulate most customers from sticker shock. They add that consumers who are willing to switch to cheaper plans will still be able to find bargains. \n※Headline rates are generally rising faster than in previous years,§ acknowledged HHS spokesman Kevin Griffis. But he added that for most consumers, ※headline rates are not what they pay.§ \nSenator Ben Sasse (R-NE) wants to hear the Obama administration and their Democrat allies apologize for the disastrous plan, because thus far it seems to have hurt the average American far more than its helped. ※We've reached this point because ObamaCare is built on the lie that Washington's bureaucrats are smart enough to plan health care for millions of Americans. At every turn 〞 whether it's CO-OPs collapsing, premiums skyrocketing, or big insurers bailing 〞 the American people have paid the price. More spin won't solve this 〞 it's time for the White House to admit that this law isn't working.§ \nThe people of Arizona woke up to even scarier news on Wednesday when they learned that their premiums would be rising by 116% this year! \nHowever, in Arizona, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark ※second-lowest cost silver plan§ will jump by 116 percent, from $196 to $422, according to the administration report＃ \nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called the Affordable Care Act a ※failure.§ \n※Arizona families are demanding affordability, accessibility and choice when it comes to their health care 每 not the expensive, restrictive and poor quality care that has been forced upon them by Obamacare,§ McCain said in a statement. ※Until President Obama and Congressional Democrats wake up to the law's failure, and until we repeal and replace it with solutions that encourage competition and put patients back in charge, the Washington-knows-best approach will continue to unfairly burden the Arizona families it was supposed to help.§ \nMeanwhile, it seems that Hillary Clinton hasn't gotten the memo about how bad Obamacare has been or about how much it's hurt our economy, because she's still out there running victory laps for the abysmal failure. \"You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/TfalVkgAgO \n〞 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 12, 2016 \nSomebody should probably tell her that the majority of Americans hate Obamacare and would prefer seeing it repealed. \nIn a summer that saw many insurers drop out of the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchanges, Americans' support for the healthcare law continues to be slightly more negative than positive. Now, 44% of Americans support the law, also known as Obamacare, and 51% disapprove of it 〞 similar to what Gallup measured last November. \n51% disapprove of Obamacare (or Hillarycare if you prefer), even worse about 1/3 of Americans say the law has actually HURT them, and long term most Americans think the law will end up either hurting their families or not making any difference at all. \nHopefully, the Trump campaign is paying attention and will begin hammering away on Obamacare. This is a winning issue for Republicans, and it could be the issue that helps us win in November. \nArticle reposted with permission from Constitution.com shares",

    "text": "Well, in a long list of documented lies, coverups and criminal activity , Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah continues to get busted, demonstrating that the man is a pathological liar , which makes him mentally unstable and unfit for office ( not that he was qualified in the first place ). \nFirst, let's review what Obama said. Michael Bastasch reports : \nThe White House knew President Barack Obama had emailed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email account that was run out of an unsecured server in her New York home, according to emails released by WikiLeaks. \nObama told CBS News in March 2015 he learned of Clinton's private server the way basically all Americans did, \" through news reports .\" But emails hacked from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's Gmail account suggest the White House already knew about Clinton's private email server. \n\"They know POTUS and HRC emailed,\" Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri wrote to aides in March 2015 〞 about a month before Clinton announced she was running for president in 2016. \nSo, how did Obama find out about Clinton's illegal email server ? The same way most Americans do, \"through new reports;\" at least that is the lie he told. \nSo, how do we know he's lying? First, his lips are moving. Second, is the documented evidence of a March 7, 2015 email from Josh Schwerin to Jennifer Palmieri, Kristina Schake, Nick Merrill, Jesse Ferguson, which reads, \"Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news.\" \nAnd what was the reply? \n\"we [sic] need to clean this up 每 he has emails from her 每 they do not say state.gov.\" \nThat reply came from none other than Cheryl Mills, who wrote to John Podesta. \nDoes anyone else think Josh had to change his cell phone number after this? \nThis is right along the lines of the lie Obama told when he said, \"If You Like Your Health Care Plan, You Can Keep It\" . \nAnyways, this is what we have come to expect from those who are supposed to serve the people in government, but we should not expect such and should not allow it to continue. Rather, we should be demanding that justice prevail in all things and deal with these people not just by getting them out of government, but by bringing a just punishment on them for what they have done and sending a message to anyone else that chooses to engage in this behavior while in public service that they will receive the same treatment. shares",

    "text": "Print \nMany look at the new healthcare system with their higher premiums and wonder what has happened. Why are their coverages shrinking and their premiums growing? Some have come to the conclusion that the system itself is to blame. They believe that Obamacare is broken? \nWhat they fail to recognize is that this is not the case at all. What we see as failing to make insurance better has made it worse, but it is simply a problem of ignorance. We just are not smart enough to know the truth. Higher premiums and less coverage is the point, it seems. \nBreitbart reports : \nOn Wednesday's broadcast of ※CNN Newsroom,§ MIT Economics Professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber argued that ※The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that, we need a larger mandate penalty.§ \nGruber said, ※Obamacare's not imploding. The main goal of Obamacare was two-fold. One was to cover the uninsured, of which we've covered 20 million, the largest expansion in American history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurers could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare.§ \nSo basically, everything that is being reported is not accurate. There is no reason to think that all of the insurers are bailing like rats on a sinking ship. It just appears that way. This is little more that fool's hope so that there will not be a mass exit from the exchange. \nBut, unfortunately, people no longer demand proof. They simply take a man like this at his word. So, he will get away with telling Chicken Little that the sky is not falling; even while it is coming down on his head. \nWhen you chase emptiness, God will let you catch it. \nArticle reposted with permission from Constitution.com shares",

    "text": "Print \nObamacare is once again in the news 每 this time for the massive rate hikes Americans have to look forward to in a few months. The right is decrying the hikes, as the left desperately tries to down-play them or just deflect and change the subject. \nCitizens already stretched to their budgetary limits are wondering how on Earth they will ever be able to afford the insurance premiums 每 some rising well over 50%. I personally fail to see how a family who is struggling to pay their current premiums will ever be able swing even a 15 or 20% increase, much less 50%. \nCombine the massive rate hikes with the availability of insurers, which shrink every year, and you have a recipe for mass financial disaster. Can you say a record year for personal bankruptcy? Yeah 每 I think so. And always remember 每 Obamacare is just shoddy health insurance. It is NOT healthcare, as everyone on the left consistently and purposely sells it. The left does like their word games. \nBut, as has been said a myriad of times from us on the right 每 Obamacare is a fiasco by design. It is a premeditated failure. A single-payer, entirely government-run system has always been the end. Obamacare was always intended to be the deceptive means to that end. \nAs a single-payer healthcare system is the want of the leftist statists, let me site yet another example of what the future holds for many in the good ole U.S. of A. \nJolly old England is said to have the ※best of both worlds§ 每 private and public healthcare; but in fact, only the wealthiest 5-7% can afford the private care, leaving the rest to the public option 每 which is far from adequate. \nInadequate care and hopelessly long wait times just to receive the sub-par care is the rule in England, not the exception. \nIn 2011, the UK Telegraph reported that, ※NHS [National Health Service] managers are deliberately delaying operations as they wait for patients either to die or go private in order to save money, according to an official report.§ That's right. In order to cut costs, bureaucrats at the NHS have become defacto ※death panels.§ Sound familiar? \nOne such poor sap who just recently ended up caught in the maze of the British healthcare bureaucracy is Paul Dibbins, a former British Army Lance Corporal. The father of three had suffered serious frost bite. After months of trying to heal his toes, he had developed gangrene. \nThe NHS scheduled surgery to remove his lower leg 每 below the knee. Without the surgery, the gangrene would spread, eventually killing him. A grim outlook either way, but having no lower leg is better than an agonizing death, he thought. \nUnfortunately for the former soldier, the NHS made him wait six weeks for the procedure. And then something happened. At the eleventh hour, NHS postponed the surgery yet again, for another six weeks 每 no doubt, in an attempt to cut costs. \nMr. Dibbins was desperate at this point and decided to do the only thing he could. He said: ※Knowing that it would take at least another six weeks to get me in front of a surgeon again, that's when I bit the bullet and cut off the toes.§ \nAnd that he did. Using no painkillers at all, Dibbins scraped away the dead flesh from his two blackened toes and proceeded to sever the tendons with the only thing he had available 每 a pair of nail clippers. The procedure took him about an hour to remove both affected toes. A surgeon later told him he was crazy, but that the home-style operation was ※textbook.§ \nSo, as we proceed further down the path of a single-payer, government run healthcare system, home surgery may also be in our future 每 as Washington bureaucrats and death panels decide which of us is worth saving. \nI better dust off my old game of ※ Operation § and start practicing. shares",

    "title": "Will Barack Obama Delay Or Suspend The Election If Hillary Is Forced Out By The New FBI Email Investigation?",
    "text": "Email \nJust when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails ※did not come from her private server§, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the ※emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry§, and according to some reports there may be ※potentially thousands§ of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? \nLet's take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ \nAfter recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ※appear to be pertinent§ to the email probe. \n※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,§ Comey wrote the chairmen. ※I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.§ \nAt this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton's closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton's Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ \nWe don't know what this means yet except that it's a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that's where we are＃ \nIs it a certainty that we won't learn before the election? I'm not sure it's a certainty we won't learn before the election. \nOne thing is, it's possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ \nIf the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? \nIt is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. \nSo those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. \nBut if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year's primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group's bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nIt would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. \nIn such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be ※fair§ until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. \nMeanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. \nAnd CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ \nAn artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. \nMogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. \nThe AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. \nWithout Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. \nSo if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. \nAt this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen. \nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare",

    "title": "Will Michelle Obama Be The Replacement Nominee If The FBI Email Investigation Ends Hillary Clinton's Campaign?",
    "text": "Email \nI realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre, but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen. We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. \nIn fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled ※ Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside ※＃ \nSo what should the Democrats do now? \nIf ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: \nThey would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. \nDemocrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. \nBut what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year's primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group's bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nSo if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. \nWho would they choose? \nLet's take a look at the top five options＃ \n#1 Tim Kaine \nHe would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton's running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. \nAnd at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. \nSo to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. \n#2 Joe Biden \nVice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run ＃ \nVice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. \nBiden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. \nBut according to the vice president, the short answer is ※no.§ The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. \nUnfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. \nBiden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn't have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. \nBiden would probably represent the ※safest§ choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. \n#3 Bernie Sanders \nBernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. \nFirst of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. \nSecondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. \nThirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be ※another McGovern§ and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. \nSo even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. \n#4 Elizabeth Warren \nElizabeth Warren would be very popular with the ※Bernie Sanders§ wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. \nSo she is definitely a possibility. \nBut she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as ※another McGovern§ because of her far left policies. \n#5 Michelle Obama \nOne recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. \nAnd these days Barack Obama's approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. \nSo the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. \nMichelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as ※the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign§ in a recent MSN article entitled ※ In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice ※＃ \nThe speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama's place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. \n※When you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,§ said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. ※We know she didn't like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.§ \nIf I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. \nOf course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. \nAnd I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. \nIn the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. \nAnd if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down. \nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare Don't forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter .

    "title": "Obama's DOJ is Blocking the FBI from Huma Abedin's Clinton Emails!",
    "text": "Email \nAmerica learned a worrisome bit of news on Sunday when mainstream media outlets began reporting that while the Department of Justice was in possession of tens of thousands (possibly hundreds of thousands ) of new (and unseen) emails pertinent to the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server, they were NOT allowing the FBI to have access to those emails ! \nThis is extremely frustrating news, as there is less than two weeks to go before Election Day and most Americans would like to know for sure if Hillary Clinton is indeed a crook before they go and pull the voting lever. Yahoo News reported that the FBI had not yet attained a warrant to see the emails, but this should be a moot point for two reasons 每 first, Anthony Weiner (the subject of the investigation that dug up the new Abedin/Clinton emails) has been cooperating and gave investigators clearance to all of his devices and electronic material. Secondly, Abedin previously swore to investigators that she had turned over all of her devices and all of her recorded emails. The discovery of a new device and thousands of new emails proves she lied to investigators and could be facing prison for doing so. (UPDATE: The FBI's warrant finally came through Sunday evening and they should begin combing through every email on the laptop soon.) \nWhile the DOJ may be stonewalling the FBI for now, Fox News' Bret Baier explained that the FBI doesn't need a warrant because Weiner has already given them permission to search the computer. I emailed that 2 sources say Weiner is cooperating w/ FBI- & co-owned laptop. Also NY FBI had info 4 a few weeks- pressure was building https://t.co/AHbQVtvQzg \nMore from the Daily Caller : \nAdditionally, the U.S. Attorneys offices and local law enforcement have access to the FBI laboratory , for example, to conduct ※scientific examinations of evidence for any federal, state, and/or local law enforcement organization in the United States.§ \n※With all of these law enforcement agencies, both local and federal, now looking into this case, it's a sign that they're really going after him,§ a law enforcement source told The NY Post back in September. ※They want to nail him.§ \nLess than two weeks ago, The Daily Mail reported that a federal grand jury was expected to hear the allegations against Weiner in the coming weeks. Weiner, as a result of the grand jury convening, already received a federal subpoena for his devices, as reported by CNN in September. The FBI confiscated Weiner's electronic devices on October 3, The New York Times reported . \nWhat does it all mean? \nThe FBI is going to get those emails, each and every one, the DOJ knows this, which means the only possible reason for belaboring the handoff to the FBI is to slow the course of the investigation ensuring that any new information is held until AFTER Election Day. This is corruption and election fraud of the highest order, coordinated by Obama's DOJ and executed by Attorney General Loretta Lynch. \nArticle reposted with permission from Constitution.com Don't forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter .

    "title": "Obama to Hillary - Under the Bus You Go",
    "text": "Email \nBarack Obama and Hillary Clinton are standing on a street corner waiting for a bus. As the bus approaches, Obama grabs Hillary and tosses her out on to the street, where she is then run over by the oncoming bus. \nOf course, this would never happen 每 literally. Neither Obama nor Clinton would ever be caught dead on a bus. Under it, yes - but not in one. \nNaturally, I'm kidding about Barack tossing Hillary under the bus. He has not the strength to do so. Again 每 kidding. These are the jokes. I'm here all night. \nBut seriously 每 it does appear that Obama has figuratively thrown her highness under the bus, again, for her ever-growing email scandal. I say again, for this isn't the first time the president has done so. \nIn 2015, when asked about Hillary's private server, Obama stated , ※The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the Blackberry I carry around, all those records are available and archived.§ Translation 每 I don't know what she has been doing, but I follow the law. \nMy buddy Tim Brown at Freedom Outpost reported that both Obama and Biden, prior to the 2012 election, threw Hillary under the bus over the Benghazi scandal. Both men claimed they had no knowledge that those in Benghazi requested more security prior to the attack. Biden stated during a Vice Presidential debate that year that, ※We [Biden and Obama] weren't told they wanted more security. We did not know they wanted more security there,§ effectively hanging it on Hillary. \nIt's common knowledge of the disdain the Obamas have for the Clintons, and vice versa. As far out radical as Obama is, I don't think he's a crook 每 or if he is, he is better at hiding it. Obama doesn't appear to have sold the White House to highest bidder the way Hillary did at State 每 or selling naked options on her potential to become president. \nAt this point, it seems Barack is probably tiring of constantly having to defend a woman he really can't stand, which is why, in my estimation, he is once again hanging her out to dry. \nJust yesterday, White House spokes-punk Josh Earnest said that the White House stood by FBI Director James Comey on Monday as a man of 'integrity' and 'principle' in the face of a Democrat-led assault on his character and intentions. This is a major blow to Clinton 每 one I'm sure she is furious over. \nThe Daily Mail reports Earnest stated at a daily briefing that, ※The president's assessment of his [Comey] integrity and his character has not changed. The president doesn't believe he's secretly strategizing to benefit one candidate or one political party.§ This, despite attacks on Comey's character by Clinton, her surrogates, and now ※Dirty§ Harry Reid. \nIn a rather surprising turn, Earnest even defended President George W. Bush for his selection of Comey. This is highly unusual, as it is this White House's historic M.O. to blame Bush for literally everything. \nI don't know why the White House seems to be separating itself from the Clinton camp. If I had to guess, beyond the hatred factor, I'd say that Obama has calculated that, at this point, his legacy is far more important than a president Hillary, and he does not wish to be forever connected to the scandal-ridden candidate. It's probably a fair calculation. That, and maybe by favoring Comey in this war, he might himself purchase some good will to keep his involvement under wraps.

    "text": "Email \nIt is never so clear cut in war as it is in the movies. There are no black and white hats that participants wear. So, we should not be surprised that in our war on terror we are sometimes forced to work with such bad people. But, there should be a line as to who we are working with. We should not be working with those who hate us as much as ISIS does. \nThis seems to be the case as the assault against Mosul in Iraq begins in earnest. Groups that have been supported by our enemy and dedicated to our downfall should be excluded from the list of those fighting alongside our coalition. But, this administration does not draw such a hard line. \nBreitbart reports : \nA Reuters report has confirmed that Shiite militias closely aligned with the Iranian government and the terror group Hezbollah are actively participating in the liberation of Mosul, Iraq, from the Islamic State, following repeated denials from the Pentagon. \nThe Shiite Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) have begun moving closer to Mosul, the capital of the Islamic State in Iraq and the nation's second-largest city. The Islamic State captured the city in 2014, and the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced an operation to liberate the city earlier this month. The Iraqi army has agreed to cooperate with Kurdish Peshmerga forces and the U.S. government in the endeavor. \nThese groups have been opposed to us and our allies. They are trained and paid by our enemy, Iran. And have committed atrocities against the Sunni citizens they were supposed to be helping. \nOnce again, the president has turned a blind eye to those he has helped to take our place in this region. \nArticle posted with permission from Constitution.com Don't forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter .

    "title": "Re: Trump Tells Media Secret Obama Story Behind 2016 Election",
    "text": "Email \nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been criticized for his response as to whether he'd accept 2016 election results. His exact words: ※I'll keep you in suspense.§ Several pundits think that statement cost him the election. But read more broadly, the way the subliminal mind does, and his response was brilliant, revealing his astute instincts emanating from the newly discovered unconscious super intelligence (which we all possess). \nHis word ※suspense§ implies an unfolding drama. Indeed, the depth of this drama is immeasurable. But Trump's telling America a secret story. \nHis story is told through his super intelligence which quick reads situations before telling what it perceives between the lines. Trump's super-intel is naturally attuned to other persons' subconscious confessions. They do so in the symbolic language of ※protests too much§ denial and ※log in your eye§ projection along with other key imagery. \nHis super-intel quick reads Hillary Clinton and the media and conveys his response indirectly in code. \nThere's far more to the media's insistence that Trump was violating rules by not accepting election results. The media asked, ※Are you going to play by the rules of prior presidential candidates?§ But the big picture behind this election focuses on presidents playing by the rules, specifically the rule of law. \nUnconsciously, Trump's answer implied that the candidacy of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, raises serious rule of law questions. \nFor two weeks the media harangued Trump complaining he'd not played by society's accepted rules of sexual conduct. That criticism continued while they ignored Hillary's longtime enabling of her husband's abusive sexual behavior and her documented harassment of his victims as well as her own sexual escapades. The media wanted to turn this sexual matter into the central rule of law issue while a far more important rule of law issue regarding the nation's foundation still sits on the table. \nAs Roger L. Simon of pjmedia.com wrote on March 23, 2016, ※The very backbone of our country was the rule of law. Without [it]＃ America as we know it does not exist.§ Simon declared Americans must be convinced that the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton's email matter was handled justly and that Obama dare not interfere. Neither condition was satisfied. Obama avowed long before the Department of Justice ruled that Hillary was innocent. \nThen FBI Director James Comey in July 2016 detailed many of Hillary's rule of law violations and in a denial confession〞reading through his ※protests too much§〞revealed she should have been prosecuted although Comey lacked the courage to see it through. (On October 28 th under pressure from newly discovered emails he reopened the investigation.) \nAs Simon warned, Democrats nominated an illegal candidate who should have been tried for breaking the law. Trump reiterated that Hillary shouldn't have been allowed to run. \nTrump also reading Obama's law-breaking Yet there's a deeper, far more powerful story Trump unconsciously hints at 〞one which terrifies Democrats and the entire political class. \nTrump demonstrates his subtle super-intel instincts. He's far ahead of the media's conscious take. Deep down, Trump focused on Barack Obama who facilitated Hillary Clinton's violation of the law in her email scandal. \nTrump alludes to a far more significant rule of law issue. His super-intel continues asking the greatest question regarding the legality of any presidential election in U.S. history: the question of Obama's citizenship in 2008 and 2012. \nFrom 2008 to 2015, Donald Trump stood strong, demonstrating presidential-type leadership by insisting on respect for the Constitution. He questioned Obama's failure to produce evidence of legal U.S. citizenship. When Obama produced his alleged birth certificate under pressure in 2011, Trump was aware that Sheriff Joe Arpaio's panel of document examiners declared it a phony . \nThe media buried the issue. Reporters abused millions of Americans, including Trump, by labeling them racist conspiracy theorists〞a basic projection reflecting that the PC media was itself ※enabling the Obama conspiracy§ at the expense of our Constitution. \nDon't believe Trump's no longer a birther. Only recently, to avoid media harassment, did he claim that he accepted Obama's U.S. citizenship. But besides the birth issue, Trump saw that Obama continually functioned as an illegal president . To America's detriment he repeatedly violated laws on a whim, for example by ignoring immigration laws. \nWhen Obama continually neglected to protect America's national security, Trump confronted him. Trump recognized Obama had increasingly enabled Islamic terrorists while simultaneously building up terrorist Iran, even giving them a nuclear bomb on a layaway plan and cash money to boot. \nFollowing the June 11, 2016 Orlando massacre perpetrated by an Islamic terrorist, Trump confronted Obama, observing that Obama wouldn't identify the enemy〞call them by their name, ※Islamic terrorists§〞and Trump suggested Obama unconsciously knew the many reasons he should resign the presidency. \nOn the surface, Obama became enraged, but unconsciously Trump elicited from Obama the most shocking confession imaginable. Secretly Obama wants the truth known. \nOn the heels of Trump's challenge, Obama explained between the lines of two speeches on June 12 and 14, that he was truly a mind-controlled Stockholm Syndrome prisoner of radical Islam, programmed at an early age in his own home. \nThe decoded details are described in my book, The Stockholm Syndrome President, How Trump Triggered Obama's Hidden Confession . \nAs he intuitively put together the story of his life, Obama learned the horrifying family secret that his Muslim father had wanted him aborted. \n(My scientific forensic profiling approach confirmed that Obama's super-intel imagery pointed toward a near abortion which matched his life's circumstances including a promiscuous 17 year-old mother unexpectedly pregnant from a casual affair.) \nHis father had also emotionally ※killed him§ by abandoning him. Obama felt that pain on a daily basis, and then he learned that his father physically abused his mother and two later wives in Kenya. \nThe near-death by abortion and constant death experience at the hands of his anti-American Muslim father became fixated in Obama's mind. He became frozen in terror〞suffering a deep early-childhood trauma〞terrified that his father would kill him at any moment. \nWhen he was a child, his father was radical Islam to him〞both one and the same. To stay alive Obama became an unconscious Stockholm Syndrome victim controlled by Islam〞explaining his repeated capitulations to them as president and his curious refusal to use that term. \nObama's Stockholm Syndrome remains buried deep in his psyche. Only his unconscious super-intel can tell his story in its psycholinguistic language. In his recent speeches, he unknowingly confessed in key images such as ※doing the terrorists' work for them§ or key denials ※then the terrorists would win. I'm not going to let that happen.§ \nBut Obama further confessed in his June 14 speech, that he was programmed as ※a radical Islam mole§ to carry out a major robbery from America〞 first by stealing the rule of law and running as an illegal president. \nIn fact, Obama has robbed America in many ways: economically with massive debt and hampering business; robbed us of our borders with massive illegal immigration; of gains in racial harmony; of safe communities, of police safety, of inner city safety, of affordable health care, of military power and of our world leadership role. All the while his policies have strengthened terrorist Iran and radical Islam. \nNow return to Trump's threatened refusal to accept the election results. Consider his brilliant super-intel message to the media: ※You keep America in suspense about how you avoid the rule of law both with Hillary Clinton and especially Obama, and I will keep you in suspense as to what I'll do about it.§ \nConsciously Trump may not yet fully appreciate his deeper plans, but he hints at them strongly. \nIf Trump wins he could appoint a special committee of document examiners to study Obama's birth certificate. As Obama and Clinton have reversed themselves on gay marriage, Trump could simply change his mind about the need to clarify Obama's birthplace. \nBut if Trump loses he could still rise to the occasion by putting rule of law money behind a renewed investigation. He could potentially mobilize an abused citizenry. Rule of law Americans could demand Congress take action and legally obtain Obama's birth records〞as Obama himself, the traumatized child, has unconsciously encouraged. Obama's super-intel, like Trump's and all others, fully espouses the rule of law. And the need for America to re-embrace its moral compass is the most significant story of the election of 2016.

    "title": "Obamacare Architect Jonathan Gruber: ※Obamacare Is Not Imploding,§ ※Working As Designed§",
    "text": "MIT professor Jonathan Gruber, a well-known architect of President Obama's Affordable Care Act, tells CNN that the law known as ＆Obamacare' is working exactly as intended. \nFull transcript, via CNN: \nJONATHAN GRUBER: Obamacare's not imploding. The main goal of Obamacare was two-fold. One was to cover the uninsured, of which we've covered 20 million, the largest expansion in American history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurers could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare＃ \nThe 22% increase [in health care premiums], let's remember who that applies to. That applies to a very small fraction of people, who have to buy insurance without the subsidies that are available. \n85% of people buying insurance on the exchanges get subsidies. And for those people, this premium increase doesn't affect them. \nNow, for those remaining people, that is a problem, and that's something that we need to address, but it's not a crisis. It doesn't mean the system's collapsing. And most importantly, it doesn't affect the 150 million Americans who get employer insurance, who have actually seen their premiums fall dramatically, relative to what was expected before Obamacare. \nCAROL COSTELLO, CNN: OK. So let's talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. And I just need you to be specific, because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would be one fix that would drive premiums down. \nGRUBER: Look, once again, there's no sense of oh it just has to be fixed. The law is working as designed; however, it could work better, and I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that we need a larger mandate penalty. We have individuals who are essentially free riding on the system. They're essentially waiting until they get sick and then getting health insurance. The whole idea of this plan which was pioneered in Massachusetts was that the individual mandate penalty would bring those people into the system and have them participate. The penalty right now is probably too low and that's something ideally we would fix. \nCOSTELLO: So somebody who is president could go to congress and say, ※You know what, lawmakers, this is a fix. Can you pass this?§ Is that what would have to happen to put that fix into place? \nGRUBER: Basically, it's hard to know what dramatic fix we could do without congress participating in the process. We could do things like a stronger mandate is one. We could do things like increasing the pressure on states to expand their Medicade programs, a horrible act of political malpractice where states have left millions of people of their lowest income citizens uncovered. We could do things like that, but a lot of that would involve congressional participation. It's hard to know what you can do just on your own as a new administration. \nCOSTELLO: What about the insurers who have fled the system? How do you convince them to come back or new companies to sign on? GRUBER: Once again, I think the press here has been misleading. Some insurers are leaving. Other insurers are thriving. I think what you have is a system where we've shaken up the status quo, exactly what we expect of new innovation, disruptive innovation if you will, to do. Insurers who were thriving in the old system are finding this new system sort of hard for them. Other insurers are doing really well and what's going to happen is the natural process as the market evolves. These premiums are going to increase. That's going to allow profitable opportunities for new insurers to enter they are(ph) and bring premiums back down. So we're just seeing the ups and downs of a new market. What you have to remember is that premiums in 2014 came in way below what we expected. In fact, where they are today is exactly where they thought they'd be today. It's just they came in lower than we thought and they rose faster than we thought. And that's just some of the unpredictability of a new market. That will settle down over time. And new insurers will enter. \nCOSTELLO: OK. So hindsight is 20/20, right? \nGRUBER: Yes. \nCOSTELLO: Looking back, is there one thing that you wish was done differently? \nGRUBER: I think there's really probably two things I wish was done differently. One is I wish the mandate penalty was stronger. The other, I wish the federal government had done more to get states to expand their Medicaid programs. I think that this is a fundamental flaw in our system that states are leaving so many systems uncovered and citizens who are sick who are coming into this exchange pool and making it more expensive. \nCOSTELLO: So realistically, you know, after the next president is put into office, what do you think will happen with Obamacare? \nGRUBER: I think nothing much is going to happen, to be honest. I think that basically a system that largely works , that the flaws your seeing now or the premium increase you're seeing now are just the natural dynamics of a market as it transitions to its new state, and I think that we're just going to let it go for a couple years and it's going to get better on its own. And basically I think it's a system which largely works. \nCOSTELLO: What if Donald Trump becomes president, he has a republican congress, and he does repeal it? What happens then? \nGRUBER: Well, first of all he won't repeal it. Remember, the whole argument and public debate against this law is that people didn't get to keep insurance they liked. Well, you're going to have 20 million Americans or more who are now getting insurance that they like. You're not going to take that away from them. And let's be clear, there is no replace. There is only repeal. There is no Republican alternative to this law, and the reason is because this is fundamentally a bipartisan legislation that was originally drafted on Republican principles, to be honest. And so there is no Republican alternative. And so his repeal and replace is just repeal and leave people uninsured. That's not going to happen.",

    "title": "Will Barack Obama Delay Or Suspend The Election If Hillary Is Forced Out By The New FBI Email Investigation?",
    "text": "The Economic Collapse 每 by Michael Snyder \nJust when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails ※did not come from her private server§, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the ※emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry§, and according to some reports there may be ※potentially thousands§ of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? \nLet's take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ \nAfter recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ※appear to be pertinent§ to the email probe. \n※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,§ Comey wrote the chairmen. ※I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.§ \nAt this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton's closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton's Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ \nWe don't know what this means yet except that it's a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that's where we are＃ \nIs it a certainty that we won't learn before the election? I'm not sure it's a certainty we won't learn before the election. \nOne thing is, it's possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ \nIf the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? \nIt is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. \nSo those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. \nBut if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year's primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group's bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nIt would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. \nIn such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be ※fair§ until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. \nMeanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. \nAnd CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ \nAn artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. \nMogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. \nThe AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. \nWithout Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. \nSo if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. \nAt this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.",

Now we have a snapshot of how that same bias worked with jobs. \nAccording to an email chain from 2008, John Podesta received lists of exclusively Muslims and Asians to be considered for jobs in the Obama administration. The email chain revealed that in this process, Middle Eastern Christians were purposefully excluded, or set aside in a separate list, with an aide writing, \nIn the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (of outside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be Muslim American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of uncertain religion (esp.

    "title": "Tom Hayden: From SDS and Viet Cong to Progressives for Obama",
    "text": "Reprinted from Spectator.org . \nTom Hayden, the Vietnam War protester and SDS founder, died this past weekend at age 76. \nHayden's journey was in many ways tragic. Born December 1939 in the Detroit suburbs, he was not, unlike many radical leaders, a red-diaper baby. His parents were Irish Catholics who named him after St. Thomas Aquinas and sent him to Catholic school. His father was a Marine who worked for Chrysler, and an abusive drunk. Hayden's parents had a rocky marriage and divorced when he was a boy, which affected him terribly. Hayden's friend and ex-radical, David Horowitz, observed that Hayden harbored what Irving Howe once described as an ※obscure personal rage,§ possibly from his estrangement from his father. ※Tom was indeed an angry man,§ wrote Horowitz, ※who seemed in perpetual search of enemies.§ \nHayden channeled that anger into a group that did much damage to America, and was the antithesis of anything that Thomas Aquinas would have ever imagined: SDS, Students for a Democratic Society. \nHayden will be forever young and forever a hippie in the memories of many Americans, the snarling activist who married ※Hanoi Jane§ Fonda and literally wrote the script for SDS. Hayden wrote SDS's manifesto, its founding Port Huron Statement, which Hayden's cream-puff obituary in the Washington Post generously referred to as ※an expansive utopian manifesto that extolled ＆participatory democracy' as an antidote to the complacency and conformity of the Eisenhower decade.§ \nRight. \nHayden's odd expressions of ※participatory democracy§ included another writing he scribbled: an infamous June 4, 1968 letter wishing ※Good fortune!§ and ※Victory!§ to the North Vietnamese colonels who were killing American boys in Southeast Asia 〞 using the same kind of artillery that Hayden's sweetheart Jane posed beside in her stint as a Viet Cong cover-girl. That was just one of countless disturbing actions by Tom Hayden at the time, all of which today's leftists merrily sweep under the rug as they uphold him as a crusader for civil rights and (of course) ※social justice.§ \nBut not etched in our memory was what might have been Tom Hayden's swan song long after his and his wife's cheerleading for the Viet Cong: namely, the document that he wrote for our President of Fundamental Transformation. Few know this, but Hayden was a founder of another group of destructive forces, a group called Progressives for Obama. \nThe group's members came together in 2008, coalescing around the only Democratic presidential nominee in their lifetimes who was far-left enough for them to support. They constituted a Who's Who of the '60s SDS crowd. Among the nearly 100 formal ※signers§ to Progressives for Obama were Mark Rudd, Carl Davidson, Jane Fonda, Thorne Dreyer, Daniel Ellsberg, Richard Flacks, John McAuliff, Jay Schaffner, and more. Columbia University was naturally well-represented, if not through the likes of Rudd, who shut down the campus in 1968, then through current faculty such as Todd Gitlin, a former SDS president who today is professor of journalism, sociology, and chair of Columbia's doctoral program in communications. \nWhereas the likes of Obama friends Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn were thrust into the national spotlight in 2008 by conservatives like Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, Progressives for Obama flew under the radar, largely unnoticed even by the right. \nAppropriately, spearheading Progressives for Obama was the man who had spearheaded SDS. Tom Hayden was one of the four ※initiators§ of Progressives for Obama, along with Barbara Ehrenreich, Bill Fletcher, Jr., and Danny Glover. \nIt is no exaggeration to say that the signers list of Progressives for Obama resembled the roster of SDS-ers called to testify before Congress in December 1969 for their subversive activities. Aside from the likes of Hayden, Rudd, and Davidson, other SDS-ers among Progressives for Obama were Bob Pardun, who was SDS education secretary from 1966-67, and Paul Buhle, a professor who has recently sought to revive SDS. \nAmong these names from the insane '60s, all were fired up in 2008 over the unique opportunity that a fellow far-left radical, one Barack Obama, offered. They saw Obama as a golden chance, a once-in-a-lifetime moment, and they got it on November 4, 2008. Obama won the day, and they at last won the day, too. \nAnd therein, among the Progressives for Obama, the testimony of leader Tom Hayden was especially revealing. \nUnderstand that after his early life establishing SDS, meeting with and expressing ※Good fortune!§ and ※Victory!§ to the Viet Cong, and vigorously protesting the American system, Hayden went into politics, professional activism, and education. Like his erstwhile SDS brethren, Hayden grasped the power of higher education (which they have pervaded), and served as a professor at Pitzer College and also at Obama's alma mater, Occidental College. \nLike Mark Rudd, like Bill Ayers, like Bernardine Dohrn (all of them now in higher education), Hayden had come to view a quick ※revolution§ of the system as too daunting, if not impossible. He had become much more patient, instead advocating a ※progressive§ evolution of slower, measured change . By 2008, he was seeking to advance the ※progressive§ cause within the established, mainstream Democratic Party. \nOf course, Hayden once helped blow up the Democratic Party's national convention in 1968. No matter: the party of 2008 was different and warmly accepted him. \nHayden was ecstatic over Barack Obama's presidential campaign. He jumped in with both feet, looking to assist wherever he could, with a rush of enthusiasm not seen since his days undermining America in Vietnam. Not one to tinker around, Hayden got to work on a formal organization and unifying statement, as he had done for SDS 〞 once again there at the creation. The man who drafted SDS's pivotal Port Huron statement got to work drafting mission statements for Progressives for Obama. \nDuring the 2008 campaign, a touched Hayden was moved to verse over the emergence of Obama. In one article, titled, ※Obama and the Open and Unexpected Future,§ written for CommonDreams.org, self-described as a website for ※Breaking News & Views for the Progressive Community,§ Hayden mused: \nI didn't see him coming. When I read of the young state senator with a background in community organizing who wanted to be president, I was at least sentient enough to be interested. When I read Dreams of My Father [sic], I was taken aback by its depth. This young man apparently gave his first public speech, against South African apartheid, at an Occidental College rally organized by Students for Economic Democracy, the student branch of the Campaign for Economic Democracy which I chaired in 1979-82. The buds of curiosity quickened. \nHayden saw in Obama a long-awaited vehicle for ※economic democracy,§ an instrument to channel an equal distribution of wealth 〞 ※economic justice,§ or ※redistributive change,§ as Obama himself had once put it. Hayden wished that, ※Win or lose, the Obama movement will shape progressive politics＃ for a generation to come.§ He also hoped that that progressive movement likewise ※might transform§ Obama as well. Both could reinforce and shape one another. \nHayden wrote that in June 2008. When Obama was elected later the following November, Hayden was beside himself with joy, surely shocked that the American electorate had finally voted for a president that Tom Hayden saw as his kind of president. Once upon a time, traditional Democrats like Hayden's parents had shaken their heads in disgust at what Tom and his pals did to their party's convention in Chicago in 1968, at what they did during the Days of Rage the next year, at what they did at Columbia during the student strike, and on and on. But now, by 2008, the Democratic Party was theirs. It belonged to the '60s kiddies. \nThe former SDS founder became particularly vocal in his praise for Obama once the election was over. During the election, the goal was to organize, raise money, but not speak too loudly, out of fear of driving away the moderates and remaining traditional Democrat moms and pops who had worked in the mines and the mills, who joined unions, who ※clinged§ to their God and guns, who prayed rosaries and filled churches, who were pro-life and anti-gay marriage. With the presidency now secured, Hayden could open up. Joined by his former comrades at the take-no-prisoners website of Progressives for Obama, he began regularly sounding off against Obama's critics 〞 those opposing ※single payer§ or the ※public option§ in ※healthcare reform,§ or government ※management§ of General Motors 〞 with the subtlety of a howitzer. \nWith the presidency won, Hayden and his allies were free to express themselves, to demonize health-insurance companies, the financial-services industry, AIG, the Big Three automakers, or whatever other capitalist ※reptile§ (Lenin's phrase) stood in the way of President Obama's desire for ※reform§ and mandate for ※change.§ \nIn the two-term presidency of fundamental transformation under Obama, Hayden and friends achieved many of their common dreams. \nBy this election cycle, in 2016, Tom Hayden must have been mesmerized by the revolution he and his fellow radicals had pulled off in the Democratic Party. \nAlas, it was fitting that Tom Hayden became seriously ill (his final stand) during a turn for the worse at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this past summer, where he was striving to ensure that the Democratic Party continue along the radical path of fundamental transformation that he and his allies had been unable to achieve via SDS and the Weather Underground. That path, in the hands of Hillary Clinton, is assured. \nToday, at long last, for Tom Hayden and friends, the new Democratic Party and the new America is theirs. He can rest in peace, assured that his mission is finally being accomplished.",

    "text": "Obama Votes Against US at UN October 27, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nObama's abstention from a UN vote against the US is a new low for the most anti-American administration in American history. Under Obama, our foreign policy has been reoriented toward damaging our own interests as much as possible. But actively opposing US policy at the UN is a new low. \nThe resolution A/RES/71/5 is on the \"Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba\". \nIt was introduced at the request of Cuba back in '91 with a memorandum that accused America of \"pursuing an aggressive policy against Cuba with the declared aim of imposing on it the political, social and economic order which the united States authorities consider most fitting. This policy has included direct military intervention, the threat of nuclear annihilation, the instigation and carrying out of countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate Cuban leaders.\" \nAs Obama's creepy toady Ben Rhodes tweeted, \"No reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose.\" \nExcept the failed policy is that of the United States. By \"we\", Rhodes means that Obama and the left aren't going to defend the United States in international forums when they disagree with the US. \nAll this is yet another reminder that the people running the country are not of the country. They're a hostile foreign ideology that sees itself as separate from the United States and does not believe it has any responsibilities toward the United States. \nAt the UN, Samantha Power took the anti-American positions to applause from a UN united with Obama against America. \n\"For more than 50 years, the United States had a policy aimed at isolating the government of Cuba. For roughly half of those years, UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain. [Applause.] Thank you. \" \nThis is treason.",

    "text": "ObamaCare is Great. We Just Need to Punish People for Not Using It October 27, 2016 \nBut...but... I thought we were trying to help people. \nObamaCare visionary Jonathan \"Stupidity of the American Voter\" Gruber is back. When last we heard from the man with the same name as the Die Hard villain, he was being ushered off the scene after explaining how stupid everyone was . \nAn architect of the federal healthcare law said last year that a \"lack of transparency\" and the \"stupidity of the American voter\" helped Congress approve ObamaCare. In a clip unearthed Sunday, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Jonathan Gruber appears on a panel and discusses how the reform earned enough votes to pass. \nHe suggested that many lawmakers and voters didn't know what was in the law or how its financing worked, and that this helped it win approval. \"Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,§ Gruber said. \"And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass.\" Gruber made the comment while discussing how the law was \"written in a tortured way\" to avoid a bad score from the Congressional Budget Office. He suggested that voters would have rejected ObamaCare if the penalties for going without health insurance were interpreted as taxes, either by budget analysts or the public. \"If CBO scored the [individual] mandate as taxes, the bill dies,\" Gruber said. \nNow the Gruber is back... and ready to explain why the only problem with ObamaCare is the lack of severe beatings . \n※There is no sense in which§ the law ※has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that, we need a larger mandate penalty. We have individuals who are essentially free-riding on the system, they're essentially waiting until they get sick and then getting health insurance. The whole idea of this plan, which was pioneered in Massachusetts, was that the individual mandate penalty would bring those people into the system and have them participate. The penalty right now is probably too low, and that's something I think ideally we would fix.§ \nIdeally we would penalize Gruber and everyone involved in inflicting this monstrosity on the public. But predictably Gruber's proposal is to offer up more beatings until morale improves. While pretending that anyone who isn't on ObamaCare is just a \"free rider\".",

    "title": "The Left in Power: Clinton to Obama",
    "text": "Search The Left in Power : Clinton to Obama David Horowitz explains how the Democrats became a leftwing party in Volume VII of the Black Book of the American Left. October 28, 2016 Richard Baehr \nBelow is Richard Baehr's review of David Horowitz's new book, The Left in Power: Clinton to Obama (reprinted from American Thinker with permission). The book is volume 7 of The Black Book of the American Left , a multi-volume collection of David Horowitz's conservative writings that will, when completed, be the most ambitious effort ever undertaken to define the Left and its agenda. (Order HERE .) We encourage our readers to visit BlackBookOfTheAmericanLeft.com which features Horowitz's introductions to Volumes 1-7 of this 9-volume series, along with their tables of contents, reviews and interviews with the author. \nEvery year, there is some report of the blissful ignorance of American history demonstrated by the supposedly best and brightest at elite American universities. Suffice it to say the collected writings of David Horowitz on the American Left, which constitute part of a solid foundation for understanding the last half century of American politics, are nowhere to be found on any college or high school reading list. \nHorowitz's latest book, The Left in Power: Clinton to Obama , is the seventh volume in his nine-volume collection, The Black Book of the American Left . This new volume provides a collection of his writings over the last quarter century, focusing primarily on the Left's control in our government and culture. As Horowitz reveals, even during the Bush years, conservatives were on the defense and leftists controlled the narrative as they attempted to destroy Bush and his chances for re-election in 2004. Their primary mode of attack was to undermine America's efforts in Iraq almost from the start of the conflict, when just months earlier a majority of Senate Democrats and near half of House Democrats had supported the President. The Left then destroyed Bush's second term with bogus charges of racist neglect in the handling of Hurricane Katrina. There was plenty of incompetence in the response to Katrina, but local and state officials 〞 all Democrats, of course, and many of them African American 〞 were the principal operators on the ground during the crisis. \nThe immediate abandonment of support for the Iraq war effort was a signal event in American history, sending a message that a large part of the Democratic Party was not remotely concerned about the morale of our men and women fighting overseas. The weak effort by some Democrats to hold onto an ounce of patriotic resolve -- ※end the war, support the troops§ -- was designed more for campaign speeches than any meaningful attempt to convey national unity for the effort underway by our armed forces. So too, the obsession with Abu Ghraib gave the lie to the Democrats' ※support our troops§ message, as a broad brush was used to paint the incident as somehow what you would expect from our military on a routine basis. \nHorowitz outlines this narrative, faulting the Bush administration for failing to fight harder to present its story of why we went into Iraq and the risks if we had done nothing. Regrettably, the Bush administration never had a chance to get a better defense of the Iraq war out to the media. Most in the media considered the Bush administration illegitimate due to its narrow victory in the 2000 presidential contest, a lie to be sure . Unfortunately, it is almost certainly true that the media today are far more in the bag for the left than ten or twenty years ago and work harder at pushing the left's agenda. The soft liberalism of Walter Cronkite has been replaced by cable and national network anchors who routinely bury stories embarrassing to their side and focus on those that can do damage to the other side. During the current Presidential election cycle, we have seen the most prestigious media organs explain why it is necessary and appropriate for them to be biased this year. It is a special time, they argue, because Trump is, in their view, a unique threat to the Republic. \nOn the other hand, the media have been loath to consider the damage to the country caused by Barack Obama -- the loss of respect abroad for America's will to fight, the degradation of our military readiness, the fraying of ties with allies, and the near obsessive outreach to America's enemies that led to agreements such as the nuclear deal with Iran, best described as an abject surrender of American interests that will lead to the funding of fanatical nuclear regime. About 85% of those supposedly sensible pro-Israel Democrats walked the plank behind their great leader on that deal, with no visible regrets to date. There was simply too much political risk to oppose the first black president of their party. The media were happy to parrot the administration's talking points for the nuclear deal, something the manipulators crowed over at the White House. \nAt least in the propaganda use of Abu Ghraib, the Left was honest in revealing what it thinks about the military. As Horowitz outlines in article after article, the Left is fighting a war that most Americans do not see, disguising its intentions through its aggressive, unceasing promotion of ※progressive§ policies ※to make America a better place.§ This commitment to deception emerges, Horowitz reveals, from the allegiance to the ideology of Saul Alinsky's ※Rules for Radicals,§ a formative doctrine for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The progressive goal is to achieve a new society that has never been seen before in this country, though it has been promised and has catastrophically failed in many places around the globe. In America, the Left is not only unconcerned with selling their program to the public, but also, Horowitz argues, it is fearful of the result of voters knowing what it is pursuing. One prime example was the admission of MIT professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber that health care law would never have made it through Congress if it had been presented honestly. \nThe Left is also busy at work making it easier for itself to win politically. Horowitz provides chapter and verse on the Left's efforts to rapidly change the composition of the voting pool -- motor voter registration with no birth certificate required, fighting every effort to combat voter fraud with charges of racism and ※turning the clock back,§ even when states were willing to pay for potential voters obtaining the needed documents to register, support for open borders, expansion of legal immigration, and amnesty and citizenship (and voting rights) for more than ten million already in the country illegally. Here the Left's mentor and financier is George Soros and his buddies, who have funded dozens of organizations which fight on multiple fronts every day to advance the left politically. And Horowitz has done a great public service by his Discover the Network listing of the people responsible for America's steady drift to the radical Left. \nThe Left uses the racism charge in many of the confrontations it creates. Of course, the problems of America's inner cities, all under complete control of one political party for half a century, have never been of even near equal interest to the Democrats as their ability to continue to win enormous majorities among inner city voters, particularly African Americans. The Left has fully endorsed the teacher unions' opposition to charter schools, and voucher programs, though both are popular with minority group parents and children. The two major teachers unions are simply too powerful a support group for the Democratic Party (campaign cash, votes, and volunteers) for the Left to support policies that might lead to a better future for kids as opposed to continued growth in expenditures for the teachers unions and their workforce. \nIn the last two years, the Soros-funded Black Lives Matter movement has created a near national hysteria over the alleged systematic effort by police to kill unarmed black men. Between two and three dozen unarmed blacks are killed by cops each year, many of them in situations where the §victims§ were almost certainly responsible for what happened to them -- Michael Brown in Ferguson is a prime example. One wonders where the news media are to report on the police shooting of unarmed whites, which greatly outnumber those of unarmed blacks. Perhaps because there are no riots, or looting, these incidents have no cachet. More likely, they do not fit the systemic racism charge now routinely thrown around by everyone from the current President to Hillary Clinton. \nIn Chicago in 9 months this year, over 400 blacks, mostly men, have been shot and killed, almost exclusively by other black men. By year end, over 4,000 Chicagoans will have been shot. One might think this was a bigger story of urban calamity and civil society breakdown than a shooting in Charlotte. Chicago's mayor says that police ※have gone fetal,§ avoiding making stops in crime ridden neighborhoods, with the ACLU looking over their shoulder demanding a report for every stop, and activists in the neighborhoods treating the police with scorn and abuse, following a bad police shooting captured on video and kept hidden from the public by Chicago's mayor to protect his re-election bid. Rahm Emanuel must also have read Alinsky, for he knows whose hide to protect first and foremost. The victims of the police pullback in Chicago, Baltimore, St, Louis and other cities, called ※the Ferguson effect,§ are many more dead black men, killed in crime waves that are reminiscent of the 1990s. Even the FBI Director admits the Ferguson Effect is real, when not covering for Hillary Clinton. \nHorowitz' latest book is full of insights and straight talk on the goals and the mission of the Left, and how it has advanced its cause this last quarter century. He provides the kind of arguments that keep his books from getting reviewed by the New York Times. And there is always a horrible slur available from the Left to describe a viewpoint that counters one of its missions. The Left chooses to ignore the argument and uses character assassination for the people making it. It argues that these are people (Horowitz included) unworthy of serious consideration, or respect. \nSilencing the critic or the dissident or limiting his visibility has been a long time weapon of the Left. So far, Horowitz keeps writing, and America is free enough that the Left, though it clearly wants to, cannot ban his books. George Soros and his family have another $20 billion to spend on changing America. The Alinsky acolytes have their mission laid out to make use of the funds and create an America where the smart bureaucrats can organize society and distribute its wealth, so results are all equal. And we can all sing along with the Pete Seeger songs as we turn away from any role overseas (where of course we have primarily been an agent of evil) and disinvest in defense every year. \nLet's hope that some of America's young will read Horowitz' books,and learn what their professors and teachers won't teach them.",

    "title": "Checkmating Obama",
    "text": "Originally published by the Jerusalem Post . \nIn one of the immortal lines of Godfather 2 , mafia boss Michael Corleone discusses the fate of his brother, who betrayed him, with his enforcer. ※I don't want anything to happen to him while my mother is alive,§ Corleone said. \nMessage received. The brother was murdered after their mother's funeral. Last week it was reported that the Obama administration has delivered a message to the Palestinian Authority. The administration has warned the PA that the US will veto any anti-Israel resolution brought before the UN Security Council before the US presidential elections on November 8. Message received. Open season on Israel at the Security Council will commence November 9. The Palestinians are planning appropriately. Israel needs to plan, too. Israel's most urgent diplomatic mission today is to develop and implement a strategy that will outflank President Barack Obama in his final eight weeks in power. Lobbying the administration is pointless. Obama has waited eight years to exact his revenge on Israel for not supporting his hostile, strategically irrational policies. And he has no interest in letting bygones be bygones. Before turning to what Israel must do, first we need to understand what Israel can do. A good place to begin is by considering what just transpired at UNESCO, where twice in a week, UNESCO bodies resolved to erase 3,000 years of Jewish history in Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. The fight that Israel waged at UNESCO is not the fight it needs to wage at the Security Council. The stakes at the Security Council are far higher. Like the UN General Assembly, UNESCO's decisions are non-binding declarations that have no legal or operational significance. As such, there is no reason to expend great resources to fight them. For Israel, the goal of the fight at UNESCO is not to defeat anti-Israel initiatives. That is impossible given the Palestinians' automatic majority. The purpose of the fight at UNESCO is to humiliate European governments that side with antisemitic initiatives, and to weaken the congenitally anti-Israel body itself. The government achieved both of these objectives. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's disavowal of his own government's abstention from the vote on the first resolution 每 like the similar position taken after the fact by the Mexican government 每 was a diplomatic victory for Israel. So too, the fact that UNESCO's own Secretary-General Irina Bukova felt compelled to disavow her own agency's actions by rejecting the resolution's denial of the Jewish people's ties to Jerusalem was a significant victory for Israel. Her statement was deeply damaging for UNESCO and its reputation. Finally, the fact that Tanzania and the Philippines voted against the resolution was a testament to Israel's capacity to convince other governments to abandon their traditional pro-Palestinian voting pattern. The Palestinians won the vote at UNESCO because they are more powerful diplomatically than Israel. They have an automatic anti-Israel majority. But they weren't empowered by their victory. To the contrary. They were bloodied by it. In a sign of their weakening hold on member nations, the Palestinians and Jordanians felt compelled to send a threatening letter to the members of UNESCO's World Heritage Committee lest they dare to vote against the resolution. Powerful players don't make threats. They don't need to. Israel's experience at UNESCO teaches us that there are governments that are open to counteroffers. Israel doesn't need to hide in America's shadow. It is capable of working on its own to blunt the impact of the Palestinians' automatic majority. And it will need to use all of its resources to fend off a US-backed assault at the Security Council. Unlike UNESCO, the Security Council can pass legally binding resolutions. Israel needs to be prepared to bring all of its resources to bear to prevent such a resolution from being adopted against it. Obama's intention to abandon Israel at the Security Council means that Israel comes to this battle severely hobbled. But there is one advantage to the US's betrayal. Over the years, Israel's ability to trust the US to veto anti-Israel resolutions at the Security Council was been a mixed blessing. On the one hand, the US has secured Israel from diplomatic assaults. But on the other hand, our ability to trust Washington has made us diplomatically lazy and ineffective. Safe in Washington's shadow, we have behaved as through all diplomacy is public diplomacy. That is, we have pretended that statecraft begins and ends with making the moral or strategic case for our side against the other guys. But public diplomacy is just one diplomatic tool. The Syrian regime, for instance, has no moral case for securing international support. Bashar Assad didn't convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to support him by arguing that he is better than alternative regimes. He bought Putin's support by offering him permanent air and naval bases in Syria. Then there is Morocco, another weak state with no public diplomacy case to make. Last March, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon outraged Rabat when he acknowledged the plain fact that Western Sahara, which Morocco occupies, is ※occupied territory.§ Morocco quickly secured the support of Spain and France and launched an all-out onslaught against Ban. How did Morocco manage? Morocco's most powerful diplomatic resource is its control over migration flows from North Africa to Europe. Anytime it wishes, Rabat can open the migratory floodgates just as easily as it can keep them shut. And the French and Spanish know it. In less than a month, Ban issued repeated abject apologies. Game. Set. Match. Morocco. From reports to date, it appears that shortly after the US elections on November 8, the Malaysians or Egyptians will submit a Palestinian-backed resolution that defines Israeli communities in united Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria as illegal. If the resolution is brought to a vote, the US will fail to veto it. Such a resolution, or a resolution obligating Israel to withdraw to the 1949 armistice lines, would cause Israel grave harm. So what resources does Israel have to prevent this from happening? Of course, we have public diplomacy. And that might work with some friendly nations. But it won't get us over the top. We need to learn from the Syrian and Moroccan examples and consider what we have to offer Security Council members in exchange for their support in scuttling the approaching onslaught against us. One such resource is the US Congress. Israel's allies in Congress are sickened by the Obama administration's devastating Middle East policies. A solid majority of lawmakers can be trusted to support actions that will reinforce Israel's position. Israel has other resources as well that we can trade on. We have natural gas. And we have technologies that the governments of the world require to surmount the challenges of the 21 century. There is no reason to give these resources away when we can trade them for diplomatic support. As for the Palestinians, as the UNESCO vote showed, they are less popular now than at any time in the past 40 years. All they have to offer is threats and antisemitism. Both are powerful weapons. But they are no longer invincible. Israel's goal must be to use our resources at the Security Council in a manner that will make it impossible for Obama to enable an anti-Israel resolution to pass. A method for achieving this goal has two components. The first component is to convince a friendly country on the Security Council to propose a balanced resolution that would counter the Palestinian-backed Israel-bashing one. Such a resolution could include four points. First, it could deplore efforts to deny Jewish history in Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Second, it can condemn the PA/PLO for their continued unlawful funding of terrorists. Third, it can urge Israel to restrain settlement construction in areas that in previous negotiations have been identified as likely territory for a future Palestinian state. Fourth, it can call on Israel and the PA to reinstate negotiations immediately without preconditions. Israel has friendly ties with a few Security Council members, among them Uruguay and New Zealand. In the final weeks of the Obama era, it is possible that Israel will be able to convince one of them to submit a balanced resolution along these lines. Obama would be hard-pressed to oppose such a resolution in favor of one that singles Israel out for rebuke. But that still is insufficient. Obama can make Uruguay and New Zealand a better offer if he wishes. And so we move to the second aspect of the plan. If we learn nothing else from the Obama era, we must recognize that the time has come for Israel to stop sufficing with just one Security Council veto. Most states have several. And we need a few more. Russia today is the best place to start our search for a second veto. Putin is a dealmaker. As his agreement with Assad showed, he is willing to consider attractive offers. Obviously, Israel won't offer Russia bases. But we do have other things to offer Putin in exchange for a veto. For instance, in exchange for a Russian veto at the Security Council, Israel can offer Putin to lobby the US Congress to cancel US sanctions against Russia over Russia's annexation of Crimea. Israel has no dog in that fight. And the sanctions are not getting the US anywhere. Putin might go for the deal for two reasons. First, by stepping into the breach and defending Israel against Obama, he will humiliate Obama. Second, if Israel succeeds with the Congress, he will reap economic rewards. For his part, Putin wouldn't even have to openly side with Israel. All he would have to do is announce that in the interests of regional stability, Russia will not support an unbalanced resolution on Israel and the Palestinians. If Putin supports a balanced resolution, Obama will be checkmated. His plan to take revenge on Israel for not following him off the strategic cliff will be foiled. Israel will have survived his presidency. None of this will be easy. And success is far from assured. There are many more ways for Israel to fail than succeed. Our diplomatic weakness remains a millstone around our neck. But as the UNESCO resolutions showed, attacking Israel is no longer cost free. We are not powerless in the grip of circumstances. We have cards to play. And now is the time to play them for all they are worth.",

    "text": "The Bundy Verdict is Another Defeat for Obama October 28, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nObama Inc. has a lot more luck with the media than it does with trials. Its lynchings of police officers have not gotten very far. Baltimore was the biggest and most resounding defeat. But it wasn't the only one. And the vastly differing treatment of the Bundy protesters and the Dakota pipeline protesters, from killing to government backing, have not had their intended effect. \nInstead Obama lost at trial. Again. \nThis time it's the Bundy case. That was when the left realized it hated civil disobedience, just before rediscovering it again when it came to environmental protests. But big gov lost this one . Again. \nA jury Thursday delivered a stunning across-the-board acquittal to the leaders and participants in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation and a remarkable blow to the federal government as it tries to tamp down a national movement led by a Nevada family to open public lands to ranchers, miners and loggers. \nThe verdicts finding Ammon Bundy, older brother Ryan Bundy and five others not guilty of a federal conspiracy drew elation from defense attorneys who spent five weeks arguing that the armed takeover amounted to a time-honored tradition of First Amendment protest and civil disobedience. \nThe high-profile case riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the isolated bird sanctuary in rural eastern Oregon. The jury's decision proved no less dramatic and sets up a showdown in the next stage of the land-rights movement. \nIt means that Big Green Gov will have to think twice next time around. Or do a much better job of picking a jury. \nThe Oregon prosecutors sat silently in front of their boss, U.S Attorney Billy Williams, and the head of the FBI in Oregon, Greg Bretzing, as the judge announced the \"not guilty'' pleas one by one. \nBut it was quickly back to more of the same. \nut the trial fireworks weren't quite over. A brawl broke out at the very end, when six to seven U.S. marshals surrounded Ammon Bundy's lawyer as he stood before the judge, arguing and shouting for his client to walk out the door a free man. They tackled him and stunned him with a Taser gun. As Mumford yelled, \"What are you doing?,'' U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown ordered, \"Everybody out of the courtroom!'' \n\"All I was asking for was papers,'' Mumford said after emerging from federal custody nearly two hours later. \"Just show me you have the authority to take Mr. Bundy into custody.''",

    "text": "Obama's UN Ambassador: Cuba is Right About Our Human Rights October 29, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nYou may remember Ambassador Samantha Power from the time she proposed invading Israel. Since then she's gone on to a glorious career of representing the Castro regime at the UN. Or is it the Obama regime. It naturally gets confusing when the US Ambassador to the UN sides with the enemy against her own country. \n\"For more than 50 years, the United States had a policy aimed at isolating the government of Cuba. For roughly half of those years, UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain. [Applause.] Thank you.\" \nUnder Obama, Power was told to abstain from opposing a resolution critical of the United States. And they say Obama is some sort of anti-American traitor. I don't see it. If he were, we would be seeing signs of it by now. \nAnyway, Power then went on to audition for the job of the UN ambassador from Cuba by claiming that critiques from a brutal Communist dictatorship about our human rights are well-founded... \n\"Let me be among the first to acknowledge 每 as our Cuban counterparts often point out 每 that the United States has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens. And we know that at times in our history, U.S. leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust.\" \nSomehow though siding with Communist dictatorships who are the enemy while betraying our allies in the region does not create any mistrust. Only opposing the left does.",

Remember those Hillary emails that have come up in the Weiner investigation? \nAs of Saturday night, the FBI had still not gotten approval from the Justice Department for a warrant that would allow agency officials to read any of the newly discovered Abedin emails, and therefore are still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen. \n※We do not have a warrant,§ a senior law enforcement official said. ※Discussions are under way [between the FBI and the Justice Department] as to the best way to move forward.§ \nThis is Michael Isikoff so the spin is an attack on Comey. Though if Comey couldn't get Lynch to sign off on a warrant, the public announcement could very well have been his way of pressuring the DOJ to do the right thing. Now that the emails are an election issue, the only way to move forward is to allow the FBI to review them. \nBut the Dems and the media are currently attacking Comey and the Isikoff piece is a typical example. Rather than tell the truth that the DOJ is obstructing the Hillary investigation, it's smearing the FBI instead. As so many have pointed out, imagine if Nixon had been a Democrat.

And Congress is meant to be kept in the dark. \nAttorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates disagreed with FBI Director James Comey's decision to notify Congress about his bureau's review of emails potentially related to Hillary Clinton's personal server, law enforcement officials familiar with the discussion said. \nThere was no direct confrontation between Lynch or Yates and Comey. Instead, the disagreements were conveyed to Comey by Justice Department staff, who advised the FBI chief his letter would be against department policy to not comment on investigations close to an election, the officials said. \nIt is in line with policy though for Lynch to have met with Bill Clinton. \nBut yes, a Hillary backer disagreed with a course of action damaging to her candidate. \nComeydecided to disregard their concerns and sent the letter Friday anyway, shaking the presidential race 11 days before the election and nearly four months after the FBI chief said he wouldn't recommend criminal charges over the Democratic nominee's use of the server. \nThe officials acknowledged there was little Lynch and Yates could do given the fallout over Lynch's controversial meeting over the summer with former President Bill Clinton. \nNote how the media is spinning this as Comey's drastic course of action while Lynch is just being a responsible public servant. The default assumption is that Comey is in the wrong for providing information to one of the major branches of government and the greater public.",

    "text": "Obama Donations Funneled Through Fake Bonuses   \nThis is some great investigative work. And it's the kind of story that flies under the radar and it's just a small component of the Democratic machine. But it is what the setup looks like . \nJon Tester didn't come all the way from Montana for the scrambled eggs and bacon. The US senator, virtually unknown in Boston, was in a conference room at the Thornton Law Firm that June morning to cash in at one of the most reliable stops on the Democratic fund-raising circuit, a law firm that pours millions into the coffers of the party and its politicians. \nTester, a massive, jovial man who raises livestock on his family farm, was more compelling than many of the other breakfast guests, all of them political candidates the firm hoped would defend the interests of trial attorneys. But the drill was basically the same. The personal injury lawyers listened politely for a few minutes, then returned to their offices. And Tester walked away with $26,400 in checks. \nBut a striking thing happened the day Tester visited in 2010. Partner David C. Strouss received a payment from the firm labeled as a ※bonus§ that exactly equaled his $2,400 contribution to Tester's campaign, the maximum allowed. A few days later, partner Garrett Bradley 〞 until recently the House assistant majority leader on Beacon Hill 〞 got a bonus, too, exactly matching his $2,400 gift to Tester. \nThat's quite a coincidence. \nFrom 2010 through 2014, Strouss and Bradley, along with founding partner Michael Thornton and his wife, donated nearly $1.6 million to Democratic Party fund-raising committees and a parade of politicians 〞 from Senate minority leader Harry Reid of Nevada to Hawaii gubernatorial candidate David Ige to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Over the same span, the lawyers received $1.4 million listed as ※bonuses§ in Thornton Law Firm records; more than 280 of the contributions precisely matched bonuses that were paid within 10 days. \nNo corruption to see here. Now let's move on to another fake scandal. \nThornton's lawyers were especially generous to Vice President Joe Biden, one of Washington's strongest advocates for trial lawyers, contributing more than $78,000 to his campaigns from 2003 to 2008. \nDuring President Obama and Biden's reelection campaign in 2012, Michael Thornton hosted a fund-raiser for the Obama Victory Fund at his house in Cambridge, where Biden was the guest of honor. Some of the biggest donors 〞 some Thornton partners gave $20,000 〞 were escorted into a private room and offered the chance to be photographed with Biden, said someone who was there. Thornton records show the lawyers were reimbursed for those donations. \nHope and change.",

    "text": "Obama Won't Vote With America at the UN Under Obama, the United States won't defend the United States. November 1, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nDaniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \nA generation ago the Communist tyranny in Cuba demanded that the United Nations condemn America for the embargo. The brutal Castro regime's rant accused the United States of threatening ※nuclear annihilation,§ ※countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate Cuban leaders.§ \nOn a cold day in October, the European left-wing activist serving as UN Ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the US at the UN. \n\"UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain,\" Samantha Power said. \n\"Thank you,\" she added, acknowledging the applause. \nUnder Obama, the United States would no longer defend the United States. A generation ago the Communists had been in Cuba. Now they were in Washington D.C. \nInstead of defending America, Obama's chosen representative agreed that our Communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy. \n※Let me be among the first to acknowledge 每 as our Cuban counterparts often point out 每 that the United States has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens. And we know that at times in our history, U.S. leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust,§ she said. \nIf the Cuban representative had been in her place, he could not have done much better. Communist Cuban propaganda was now being parroted by Ambassador Power. If the Castro dictatorship wanted to save money, it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to Washington D.C. \nThe Cuban ambassador boasted that Cuban Communists had ※rid ourselves of US imperialism§ and proclaimed that, ※We will never go back to capitalism.§ He declared that the resolution was a powerful message to ※the peoples of the world.§ The message is indeed unmistakable. \nBen Rhodes, the close Obama adviser who sold the media on the Iran sellout, curtly tweeted his justification, ※No reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose.§ \nWho is this ※we§? \nThe Cuban embargo is the ※law of the land§. It's the official policy of the United States. It's based on laws passed by Congress and implemented by President John F. Kennedy and his successors. \nThis ※we§ certainly isn't the United States government, its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one. \nOne member of the ※we§ must be Ben Rhodes because he tells us so. Who is Rhodes? An ※aspiring§ novelist who pushed Obama to back the Muslim Brotherhood takeover of Egypt, the Iran nuke sellout and now, apparently, choosing Communist Cuba over America. \nNo one has ever elected Rhodes to anything, but under left-wing rule, he outweighs Congress, President Kennedy, the law of the land and the national interests of the United States. \n※We§ is Obama who made the final decision. It's Ambassador Samantha Power. It's a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their power from a single elected official who is only one third of the government. This is the ※we§ that announced its treasonous opposition to the US at the UN. \nAmerica has a ※we§ problem. \nIf the ※we§ of the American left wants to vote its own way, it should secede to form its own country. \nWhen President John F. Kennedy proclaimed the ※Embargo on All Trade with Cuba§, he based it on authorization from ※the Congress of the United States§. That is how our system used to work. \nThese days El Teleprompte in D.C. decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with Iran, mandate transgender bathrooms, legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in Havana and he does so on his own authority. And Congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists. \nThat's not how America is supposed to work. That's how Iran works. That's how Cuba works. \nThe first word in the introduction to Obama's Presidential Policy Directive on Cuba after the date was ※I§. Obama's basis for his authority is his 2014 announcement. L'etat c'est moi. Obama is the State. \nJFK, no humble shrinking violet, mentions ※I§ only in the fourth paragraph, after Congress. What is the context of Kennedy's ※I§? ※Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority of section 620(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.§ \nThe ※I§ of JFK can only act as a servant, not a master. \nIn Obama's ※Directive§, Congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism. There is no source of authorization for anything other than Barack Obama. There is no law. Only Obama. \nNow the big ※we§ in Washington have decided that they will oppose America at the United Nations. But Ben Rhodes, who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives, made an unfortunate slip. Obama has been accused of Louis XIV's L'etat c'est moi mentality. But Ben Rhodes isn't saying, ※We are the state§. Instead he tells us that there are two powerful political entities in America. One is US. The other is We. \n※We§ does not yet entirely control the state. But ※we§ also feels no obligation to the United States. If ※we§ agrees with America, then ※we§ will vote with it at the UN. If ※we§ opposes America, then ※we§ votes against it. ※We§ will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests. Not ours. \n※We§ happens to run America. But it isn't America. It's the parasite humped on America's back. \nYou can call ※we§ by many names. Deep State is one. It's a coalition of left-wing special interests networking through politics, the non-profit sector and media corporations to control America. \nPresident Kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy . ※We are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice.§ \nKennedy was speaking after the recent Bay of Pigs crisis. The Foreign Assistance Act, mentioned by him, was passed by Congress that year. While the Cuban embargo limited the ability of the Castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world, it didn't stop the ※we§ in Washington D.C. \nIt is easy to sit here in the distant future of 2016 and wonder whether Cuba matters at all. But the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the Cold War. That struggle did not end when the Berlin Wall fell. It is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by ※We the People§ or by the nameless ※We§ of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the Nomenklatura of the left. \nBy backing away from America at the United Nations, the ※we§ have announced their independence from the laws, responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked. \nBut the ※we§ offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule. Instead they impose on us the collectivism of Yevgeny Zamyatin's novel ※We§ in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the One State that controls every aspect of human life. That novel inspired 1984. \nWhat ※we§ offer us is what Cuba's Castro, We's One State and every Communist regime offer us. It's what George Orwell in 1984 summed up as, ※A boot stamping on a human face 〞 forever.§ \nPresident Kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the ※one hundred and eighty-sixth§ year of ※the Independence of the United States of America.§ At the United Nations, Ambassador Power cheerfully declared America's enforced submission to the Communist demands for Cuba. \nThe Cuban people show no signs of winning independence from their Communist overlords. The question is will the United States of America be able to regain its independence from the ※we§?",

    "title": "Obama's Secret Muslim List",
    "text": "Obama's Secret Muslim List Why enemies of Israel and Iran's ※go-to guy§ appeared on the list. November 2, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nDaniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \nLike a warped Islamic version of Santa Claus, Obama had a secret Muslim list. And his people checked it at least twice. The list was of Muslims who were prospects for important jobs and appointments. \nIt included a Muslim who had described Israel as an ※Apartheid State,§ Iran's ※go-to guy in New York financial circles§ and a number of figures linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. \nIt was the ultimate religious test from an administration that had vocally rejected them. \nObama had claimed that having religious tests for migration was ※shameful§ and ※not American.§ \n※When I hear folks say that, well maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims,§ he huffed from Turkey. His Muslim host country was run by a bigoted sponsor of Islamic terror. \n\"We don't have religious tests,§ he insisted. \nExcept we did and we do. Obama also had religious tests. His religious tests excluded Christians and favored Muslims. That is why his Syrian refugees were between 98% and 99% Muslim with only 68 Christians and 24 Yazidis, even though both groups are real victims of the Muslim religious war. \nSyria is 10% Christian and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Yet only 68 have made it past Obama's iron curtain. That's either an Islamic religious test or the world's greatest coincidence. \nBut would the man who piously lectured us on the evils of religious tests really have a religious test? \nOf course he would. \nThe hacked emails include a list of ※Muslim American candidates for top Administration jobs, sub-cabinet jobs, and outside boards/agencies/policy committees.§ \nThe list was sent to John Podesta who headed the Obama-Biden Transition Project. It had been put together by a woman who had sat on the Commission on International Religious Freedom, but boasted that she had, ※Excluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian.§ \nHow ※shameful.§ How ※not American§ of Barack Hussein Obama. \n※Most who are listed appear to be Muslim-American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of uncertain religion (esp. Christian),§ she assured Podesta. \nReligious tests are only out of line when they exclude Muslims. Not when they exclude Christians. \nThat's the pattern which emerged from the Obama-Biden Transition Project and Obama's refugee policy. There has been a clear pattern of administration bias against Christians and Jews. And in favor of Muslims. That bias has been obvious in a foreign policy which backed Islamic supremacist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood over more moderate governments at the expense of non-Muslim populations. \nThis policy led to the displacement and death of countless Christians, and the persecution of entire communities, by an administration which then denied safe harbor to the victims of its own policies. \nAdministration bias replicated that same bigoted policy at home when it favored Islamic candidates. \nObama appointed Farooq Kathwari, the first name on the ※Muslim list§ sent to Podesta, to the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. \nThe ※Muslim list§ email had warned that, ※Kathwari's then 19-year-old American-educated son Irfan (aka Imran), was killed in 1992 fighting Jihad against the Russians in Afghanistan.§ The actions of his son, who may have been with the Mujahedeen but was also apparently outraged over India's defense of Kashmir, is of less relevance than Kathwari's appearance at an ISNA conference and another conference co-sponsored by the Muslim Students Association. Both groups are linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. \nHe co-chaired the American Muslim Task Force whose members included Salam Al-Marayati , Director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which has defended Hamas and Hezbollah, Yahya Basha, president of the American Muslim Council and a former board member of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, and assorted other Islamists . Its report complained that Muslims were inhibited from donating to ※charities§ run by Islamic terrorist groups such as Hezbollah. Yahya Basha also appeared on Obama's Muslim list. \nAlso listed was MPAC's Aslam Abdullah who had claimed that ※Zionists,§ Christians and Hindus were behind the War on Terror. He had described Israel as an ※apartheid state§ and a ※racist state.§ \nThe second Muslim on the list, Cyrus Amir-Mokri, was named assistant treasury secretary. He became the first Iranian to be named to such a high position and defended the Iran nuclear sellout. Mokri attended a meeting with members of the Iran Lobby at the White House. He also reportedly advised Obama on Iranian sanctions. \nObama had famously told NASA boss Bolden that one of his three tasks at the space agency was Muslim self-esteem. But Bolden almost didn't make it in. The Muslim list included two alternative candidates for NASA administrator. One of them, Dr. Charles Elachi of JPL was dismissed as ※possibly Christian.§ Indeed Elachi, who grew up admiring John Wayne and believes that American success is possible because it isn't \"held back by the long-standing, ingrained systems and beliefs found in the Middle East\" would have been a rather poor fit. But it is deeply shameful and un-American that his potential NASA appointment questioned his religion. That is an inappropriate religious test that Obama must apologize for. \nThe other name on the list however is Firouz Naderi, an Iranian board member of the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans which advocated in support of the Iran nuke sellout. \nEboo Patel, whose name would frequently appear on lists of Islamists in the Obama administration, first made an appearance on the Muslim List. Despite his Islamist ties, he got the posting at the Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships. Also listed were Keith Ellison, Andre Carson and Larry Shaw. Shaw sits on the board of CAIR. \nDilawar Syed, the first name to appear on the list of possible appointments, was named to Obama's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Syed is a co-founder and chair of the Asian Americans and Pacific Islander Victory Fund which has come out for Hillary Clinton. The secret Muslim list describes him as ※animated by policy issues relating to the Muslim world.§ A similar description is appended to the bio for Kashif Zafar who served as a Co-Chair of the South Asian American Leadership Council at the DNC. \nAlso on the list was Hamid Biglari. Bloomberg described Biglari as \"Iran's Man in New York§ and as the Iranian president's ※go-to guy in New York financial circles.§ Biglari was a key Iran Lobby figure. \nThe recently revealed secret Muslim list is deeply troubling. There should be no religious test for political appointments. Yet Obama had one. And his people sought to screen out Christians and favor Muslims. \nThis represents behavior that is in Obama's own words, ※shameful§ and ※not American.§ One can't help but conclude that, based on his own principles, Obama is shameful and not American.",

    "text": "Search form Search From Bad to Worse : Obama's Ransom Payment to Iran is Just the Tip of the Iceberg In his bid to pursue a legacy, Obama charts disastrous course with reckless abandon. November 2, 2016 Ari Lieberman \nMost of us, including several democratic lawmakers, cringed when Obama inked the Iran deal but those of us who are familiar with the malevolent nature of the Iranian regime, recoiled in horror when we learned that Obama transferred $400 million to the Iranians in exchange for four American citizens held captive by the mullahs on trumped up charges. The $400 million was part of a larger installment totaling $1.7 billion, ostensibly to settle claims Iran had against the United States stemming from aborted Iranian arms purchases dating back to the Shah. Obama claimed that this was money that was ※owed§ to Iran and the settlement, which included $1.3 billion in interest, saved the U.S. taxpayer ※billions§ because the Iranians were demanding even more at the Hague tribunal, where the claim was being adjudicated. \nThe timing and method of the cash transfers were disquieting to say the least and raised serious questions of legality as well as broader geo-political concerns. The Americans were freed only after Iran received its $400 million. The payment, which was airlifted in the dead of night in an unmarked cargo plane, was made in untraceable cash, stacked on wooden pallets. The Iranians demanded Swiss Francs and Euros rather than Dollars and a pliant Obama agreed to the Islamic Republic's dictates. Gleeful Iranian leaders were quick to announce victory and claimed that the payment was indeed a ransom, contradicting the administration's adamant denials. \nEven within the administration there was confusion about whether the payment was in fact a ransom. State Department spokesman Mark Toner came very close to acknowledging this fact when he noted that the $400 million was used as ※leverage§ to ensure the Americans' safe return. The White House however, quickly repudiated the State Department's characterization. \nEven if one were to believe the story peddled by the administration, the mere appearance of a quid pro quo payment potentially exposes the U.S. to extortion and hostage-taking. The Iranians certainly believed it was a ransom payment and more likely than not, every two-bit dictator on the planet saw it that way as well. \nBut there are deeper more troubling aspects to this convoluted story. In his January 17, 2016 address to the American people, Obama tried to put a positive spin on his dealings with the Islamic Republic but as noted by Rick Richman in an excellent article featured in Mosaic , the deal struck with the Iranians was rotten to its core and the administration deliberately kept the American people in the dark about various aspects of the shady arrangement. \nThe $400 million that the U.S. transferred to Iran came from Iran's Foreign Military Sales (FMS) account with the Pentagon. The balance of 1.3 billion ostensibly represented interest accrued since 1979. But Obama neglected to note that when Iran filed its lawsuit, the U.S. filed counterclaim against Iran for $817 million for Iranian breaches of its obligations under the FMS program. The U.S. could have conceivably won that counterclaim which would have meant wooden pallets of cash for the American treasury, courtesy of the Islamic Republic. \nMoreover, American plaintiffs maintained sixteen U.S. court judgments against the Islamic Republic stemming from that regime's involvement in terrorist activities. Those judgments totaled $3.9 billion in compensatory and punitive damages. \nSome plaintiffs sought to recover their Judgments directly from Iran's FMS account but their efforts were stymied by the Clinton administration. Instead, under a convoluted deal struck between Congress and the Clinton administration in 2,000, the U.S. treasury was to pay the holders of the judgments against Iran for the amount of their compensatory damages and 10 percent of their punitive damages up to the amount in the FMS fund. The judgments would then be subrogated to the United States, which meant that judgments became direct U.S claims against the Iranian government. \nIran ignored the Judgments and never paid any of the plaintiffs. Under U.S. law, the $400 million sitting in the FMS account should have gone back to the U.S. treasury, which had already paid the judgment holders. But the U.S. treasury never collected a dime on the subrogated claims since Obama shipped the money off on wooden pallets to Iran. Essentially, the U.S. taxpayer ended up footing the bill for Iran's terrorism while the Iranians were never held accountable for their maleficence. \nObama's actions represented blatant disregard for the law, for the victims of terrorism and for the American taxpayer. His claim of saving the taxpayer ※billions§ represents the zenith of mendacity. \nObama claimed that the payments had to be made in cash because existing sanctions prohibited normal banking procedures. But as noted by Richman, the sanctions regimen expressly permits payments made to settle Iranian claims instituted at The Hague, exposing yet another lie by the Obama administration. \nThere was one, and only one reason why the Iranians requested cash and all but the most disingenuous know what that reason is. The Iranians are the world's foremost state-sponsors of international terrorism. They finance terrorist groups and proxy militias throughout the region and internationally but can only do so through illicit means that circumvent normal methods of financing. Hence, they demanded untraceable cash. The misery that we are currently witnessing in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere is due in no small part to the Obama administration which provided the Iranians with the cash necessary to keep operations flowing. \nIn addition to the $1.7 billion in cash, Obama also authorized the release of seven convicted Iranian felons and expunged warrants on 14 others. But this aspect of the transaction seems almost trivial when considering the sheer mendacity and illegality of nearly every other aspect of the deal. \nLastly, the transfer of such a large sum to Iran in ※settlement§ of an alleged legal claim required the attorney general's approval but the administration has yet to produce any document bearing Loretta Lynch's signature authorizing such payment. On October 7, Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) presented Lynch with a series of questions seeking clarification of various aspects of the deal. Lynch, whose tenure as attorney general is proving to be as corrupt and partisan as her predecessor, has inexplicably refused to answer the lawmakers' queries. \nIn a desperate attempt to establish a legacy, Obama pursued the Iran deal with reckless abandon, forfeiting positions previously regarded as red lines and signing the worst deal in U.S. diplomatic history. The ancillary deal struck with the Iranians concerning American hostages was laced with outright lies and enabled the Iranians to continue their reign or regional terror. More importantly, it may also have been in violation of existing U.S. law and Lynch's stonewalling only lends credence to that notion.",

    "title": "Obama DOJ: Handmaiden of Clinton Corruption",
    "text": "Go to Article \nThe Obama Department of Justice has been corruptly aiding and abetting the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, to escape legal accountability for her actions. From Attorney General Loretta Lynch on down through the Justice Department's political ranks, the Department has blocked the FBI from searching for the truth and following the evidence of potential criminality to its logical conclusion. Whether it is Hillary's use of a private e-mail server while serving as Secretary of State or her involvement in the pay-for-play Clinton enterprise known as the Clinton Foundation, the Obama administration is applying a banana republic-style double standard to pervert justice and the rule of law in order to shield her. \nLynch and President Obama were reportedly furious with FBI Director James Comey for sending a letter to Congress on October 28 th indicating that new evidence potentially pertinent to the e-mail case had come to light, which required further investigation. This evidence consisted of a batch of e-mails FBI investigators had found on one or more computers belonging to Anthony Weiner, Clinton confidante Huma Abedin's estranged husband, while they were searching for evidence in an unrelated case involving Weiner's alleged sexting to an underage girl. Comey sent his letter after months of agonizing over his previous decision to let Hillary off the hook in the e-mail case last July. He was said by a source close to him to have been particularly disturbed by the mounting number of resignation letters from FBI agents who felt betrayed by that decision. \nDepartment of Justice officials had leaned on Comey not to send the letter to Congress, claiming that it would violate Department protocols and procedures against taking any action that could be perceived as interfering with the upcoming presidential election. To his credit, Comey ignored the Department officials' objections, claiming he had an obligation to keep the Congress and the public informed of any potentially significant new developments in the case. \nDemocrats, who had lavished praise on Comey for his July decision, lashed out at Comey for sending his letter updating Congress. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid went so far as to make the baseless charge that Comey may have violated the law by informing Congress, because, Reid argued, he appeared to be taking sides in an election. The disgraced former Attorney General Eric Holder, held in contempt of Congress for withholding information relating to the Fast and Furious scandal, said about Comey's action, ※I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI. It is up to the director to correct his mistake 〞 not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the American people.§ \nSince when has Holder been genuinely concerned about protecting our system of justice and best serving the American people? Holder had already contributed to the erosion of public trust, with his blatant politicization of the Obama Department of Justice. As evidenced by the Obama Department of Justice's handling of the multiple FBI investigations involving Hillary Clinton, the Department has continued its slide into the muck of corruption. It interfered with both the normal course of criminal investigations and the election by stacking the deck in Hillary's favor, ensuring that no indictment would occur to derail her path to succeed Obama and preserve his legacy. \nFirst, the Department of Justice reportedly refused to empanel a grand jury in either the e-mail case or in connection with the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play allegations. ※The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,§ former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said . ※That's the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I'm sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.§ \nKallstrom's belief that Lynch acted to influence the results of the FBI probes in Hillary's favor is buttressed by Lynch's 30 minute private tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton shortly before FBI Director Comey faced the cameras on July 5 th with his exculpatory announcement. \nSecond, at least five immunity agreements were handed out in the e-mail case, including to Hillary's lawyer and confidante Cheryl Mills and to Platte River Networks' Paul Combetta. It appears that Combetta had previously lied to government investigators 每 a crime in itself 每 while trying to cover up the fact that he had evidently Bleachbited e-mails to delete them, even though they had been subject to a previously issued Congressional subpoena. The immunity agreements garnered nothing in return, but had the effect of blocking access to the computer devices of the immunity beneficiaries in the FBI's separate Clinton Foundation investigation. Apparently, the Department decided against the alternative option of subpoenaing the computer devices or seeking a search warrant, rather than granting useless immunities, in order to obtain any evidence relevant to the e-mail investigation that might have been contained in those devices. \nThird, the Department and FBI did not conduct their last minute interview of Hillary Clinton under oath and allowed Cheryl Mills 每 herself a material witness 每 to sit in during Hillary's interview. They did not ask pertinent follow-up questions. There was no verbatim transcript of the interview to use in checking the veracity of Hillary's statements during the interview against her sworn Congressional testimony or her many public statements. \nFourth, the Department of Justice reportedly refused to allow the FBI to issue subpoenas to gather more evidence in connection with its investigation of the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play allegations. In fact, senior Department officials reportedly would not authorize a more thorough FBI investigation because they claimed there was not sufficient evidence gathered thus far to justify going further. Such a circular argument was a mere cover to prevent seasoned career investigators from learning the full extent of foreign government donations while Hillary was Secretary of State, their true motivations and any favors extended by the State Department in return. \nFinally, the cross-connections between the Clintons and some high level Department of Justice and FBI officials cry out for recusal. But not so in this administration. For example, the wife of the deputy FBI director who was involved in the laggard Clinton Foundation investigation, Andrew McCabe, just happened to have received a large donation from close Clinton ally Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to her 2015 run for the State Senate. \nTo make matters worse, the Obama Department of Justice assigned Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik, a close friend of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta, to communicate with Congress about what Kadzik promised would be a ※thorough§ review of the newly discovered e-mails from Anthony Weiner's online account. \nPodesta praised Kadzik in an e-mail to an Obama campaign official back in 2008 as a ※Fantastic lawyer,§ and said about his pal, ※Kept me out of jail.§ Their history together goes further back than that. During the waning days of Bill Clinton's presidency, it was Kadzik, then representing the infamous billionaire fugitive Marc Rich, who lobbied Podesta, then serving as Bill Clinton's chief of staff, for a presidential pardon on his client's behalf. Kadzik's lobbying effort, no doubt helped along by contributions to Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign and to Bill Clinton's presidential library, paid off. Bill Clinton delivered the requested pardon on his last day in office. \nKadzik joined the Department of Justice in April 2013, first as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs, and then as the Principal Deputy. With the Podesta connection intact, Kadzik has served as a highly placed Clinton campaign mole in the Department. An e-mail dated May 19, 2015 from Kadzik to Podesta, released by WikiLeaks , proves the point. Bearing the subject heading ※Heads Up,§ Kadzik advised Podesta about upcoming Congressional testimony by the head of the Department's Civil Division, and about another filing in the Freedom of Information case that would mean ※it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails.§ Podesta forwarded Kadzik's heads up e-mail to several senior Hillary Clinton campaign officials with the admonition: ※Additional chances for mischief.§ \nExploiting his coordinating role in the re-opened e-mail investigation and contacts with FBI investigators, Kadzik will now be in a position to relay inside information to his pal Podesta and to provide inside information to the Clinton campaign's supporters in Congress as well. \nThe Clintons manage to turn virtually everything they touch into a cesspool of corruption. The Obama Department of Justice is no exception.",

    "title": "Obama's DOJ Issued \"Stand Down\" Order on Clinton Foundation Investigation",
    "text": "Obama's DOJ Issued \"Stand Down\" Order on Clinton Foundation Investigation November 3, 2016 \nThere have been various insider reports on the Clinton Foundation and the Hillary email scandal on FOX. \nBut the curious thing about this Wall Street Journal report is that it's clearly aimed at defending Hillary Clinton and smearing the FBI in the battle with Obama's DOJ officials who wanted to shut it down due to their support of Hillary Clinton. \nWhich means that its information that damns its own side gains more credibility. \nJustice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions. \nFollowing the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to ※stand down,'' a person familiar with the matter said. \nA stand down order. Much like the one in Libya. \nAnd remember McCabe, whose wife's Democratic political campaign received major cash from a Clinton ally? \nAmid the internal finger-pointing on the Clinton Foundation matter, some have blamed the FBI's No. 2 official, deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation. \nNot a surprise either. \nThe FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn't tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out. \nFBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors, and some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. \nAs prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn't seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly. \nAnd that's what blew up when Team Hillary lashed out at the FBI. It was a covert war between Hillary's DOJ allies and the FBI coming out of the cold. And they pushed so hard even McCabe was disgusted. \nAs a result of those complaints, these people said, a senior Justice Department official called the FBI deputy director, Mr. McCabe, on Aug. 12 to say the agents in New York seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions, these people said. The conversation was a tense one, they said, and at one point Mr. McCabe asked, ※Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?'' The senior Justice Department official replied: §Of course not.§ \nOf course.",

    "text": "Obama's Weighs Options for His Final Stab at Israel In his twilight months in office, Obama seeks to undermine America's closest ally. November 4, 2016 Ari Lieberman \nIsraelis and the pro-Israel community at large will breathe a collective sigh of relief when Obama leaves office. During Obama's tenure, relations with Israel were caustic at best. Barely five months after taking office, he publicly launched a scathing attack against Israel 每 where he perversely insinuated a moral equivalence between Israeli and Palestinian actions 每 and did so in one of the most virulently anti-Semitic countries on the planet. He later skipped over Israel despite the fact that Israel was a mere 20-minute plane ride away. That was Obama's opening salvo against America's closest ally. It was only downhill from there. \nObama utilized high-level administration sources to leak negative information about Israel to sympathetic members of the press. In one such instance, an administration official 每probably Ben Rhodes 每 referred to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a ※ chicken-Sh*t .§ In another instance, Obama voiced concurrence with French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, when Sarkozy characterized Netanyahu as a ※ liar .§ \nOften, the Obama administration would subject Israeli dignitaries to humiliating treatment during official state visits. Israel's defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, was shamefully transformed into a persona non grata. In the most notorious incident, Obama left Netanyahu out in the cold while having dinner with Michelle and his daughters. One commentator dryly noted that Obama treated Netanyahu as though he was the president of Equatorial Guinea. \nUltimately, Obama crossed the line and received significant pushback from Democratic lawmakers and donors. Obama got the message and toned down the rhetoric but his deep-seeded animus against Israel never dissipated and relations with Israel's prime minister remained toxic. \nTensions surfaced again during Israel's counter insurgency campaign against the Gaza-based terror group Hamas. Obama held up a shipment of Hellfire missiles to Israel and then tried to strong-arm Israel into accepting a suicidal ceasefire agreement brokered by Turkey and Qatar, two despotic nations that support Hamas and gave aid and comfort to Islamic State terrorists. \nObama saw Netanyahu's opposition to the JCPOA, the so-called Iran deal, as a personal attack and allowed his petulant nature to further sour relations. The so-called ※settlements§ were another point of contention. Obama disregarded a letter of assurance to Israel provided by the Bush administration specifying that ※In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population[s] centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949＃§ \nBush gave implicit recognition to existing settlement blocs and the right of Israel to build within those blocs. It is also important to note that no new settlement was created during Obama's term of office and Netanyahu had even agreed to an unprecedented 10-month moratorium on construction within the disputed territories. But nothing was ever enough for Obama who never wasted an opportunity to excoriate Israel at every turn. His parting shot was at the United Nations General Assembly. During a recent address to that contemptible body, he explicitly singled out Israel for criticism but heaped praise on the xenophobic nation of Indonesia. Obama's moral compass had gone completely awry. \nDespite the fact that Obama is in his twilight months, he can still inflict immeasurable harm on Israel. According to a report featured in the Wall Street Journal , Obama is contemplating several options, each with significant negative implications for Israel. The report noted that he will only implement those options during the transitional period after November 8, so as not to harm Clinton's presidential prospects. \nHe may seek to remove tax exempt status for organizations supportive of Israeli communities living in East Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria. Perhaps more ominously, he may seek to impose dictates on Israel utilizing the U.N. Security Council. \nIn one such scenario, Obama may seek to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and declaring Israeli communities situated in Judea and Samaria to be illegal. Alternatively, the administration may seek formal recognition of the ※State of Palestine§ even though such a state has no formal boundaries and rejects Israel's existence as a Jewish state. Lastly, he is said to be considering the possibility of setting up the parameters of a future peace agreement that would entail significant Israeli territorial concessions. \nThe United States does not have to actively support any UNSC resolution to see the successful passage of anti-Israeli measures. It merely has to fail to exercise its veto powers. France, facing significant problems of its own in connection with its growing radicalized Muslim population, has historically been the fiercest advocate for the Palestinian Arabs. It is likely that the administration would seek to have the French submit a draft resolution and the United States would simply abstain while the permanent and non-permanent members voted, thus guaranteeing passage. \nIsrael has few friends on the Security Council and American collusion with a body that could arguably be considered today's greatest purveyors of anti-Semitism, would be an act of extreme betrayal. It would also represent bad policy and would significantly complicate efforts to broker a future peace agreement. \nBut Israel is not without recourse. There is strong bipartisan support for Israel in Congress and lawmakers from both sides of the political divide have already expressed to the White House their strong opposition to U.N. involvement. \nSome, like the Jerusalem Post's Caroline Glick, have suggested that the Israelis can reach out to the Russians with carrots in an effort to counter Obama's nefarious plans but this option seems to be a stretch. Moscow has always been in the pockets of the Muslim bloc and its recent vote at UNESCO in support of a resolution denying the Jewish nexus to Jerusalem, serves to reinforce this view. Moreover, even if Russia can be persuaded, relying on Putin for favors is akin to borrowing money from the Mafia and would come with a steep price. \nIt is ironic that with the multitude of problems currently facing the administration 每 spiraling healthcare costs, racial discord, cyber breaches, Russia's seizure of Crimea and eastern Ukraine, ISIS, the meltdown in the Arab world, Iranian terrorism, China's expansion into the South and East China Seas, the migrant crisis, immigration reform 每 Obama would choose to focus his negative energies on harming the Mideast's only democracy and America's staunchest ally. That fact, in it of itself, speaks volumes about the man.",

    "text": "Obama Should Just Pardon Hillary for Every Conceivable Crime November 4, 2016 \nDon't look now, but #PardonHer talk is growing. \nJust as the Clinton campaign and its media allies rage against the FBI, some are looking for a pardon solution. And a way to spin that pardon as something other than a straight admission of guilt. How about political reconciliation and a way to defy those mean Republicans and take the issue of all the crimes that Hillary committed off the table? Here you go. \nIt does not take much clairvoyance to predict that Clinton's most strident opponents may seek to extend the use criminal investigations as a political tactic to undermine her presidency if she wins the election next week. That prospect triggers a startling idea: Should President Barack Obamasimply pardon Clinton if she wins the election?... \nA presidential pardon could short circuit some of this maneuvering. The Constitution gives the president the power \"to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States,\" and it could be used here. The public is aware of the allegations against Clinton, yet she has continued to lead in election polls. If voters choose her for the presidency, their decision that the allegations are not disqualifying deserves respect. A presidential pardon could ratify that assessment. \nYes, but what should Obama pardon Hillary Clinton for? Corruption, bribery, abuse of classified information? How about everything. Let's just print up a list of every possible crime and pardon Hillary for all of them. It would save time, energy and raise Hillary above the law. It would be a clear statement that she could get away with murder. \nLiterally.",

    "text": "EMAIL US: CONTACT@GOVTSLAVES.INFO Home ? POLITICS ? WILL BARACK OBAMA DELAY OR SUSPEND THE ELECTION IF HILLARY IS FORCED OUT BY THE NEW FBI EMAIL INVESTIGATION? WILL BARACK OBAMA DELAY OR SUSPEND THE ELECTION IF HILLARY IS FORCED OUT BY THE NEW FBI EMAIL INVESTIGATION? 0 SHARES \n[10/31/16] MICHAEL SNYDER -Just when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a game changer into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails ※did not come from her private server§, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the ※emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry§, and according to some reports there may be ※potentially thousands§ of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? \nLet's take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ \nAfter recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ※appear to be pertinent§ to the email probe. \n※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,§ Comey wrote the chairmen. ※I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.§ \nAt this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton's closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton's Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ \nWe don't know what this means yet except that it's a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that's where we are＃ \nIs it a certainty that we won't learn before the election? I'm not sure it's a certainty we won't learn before the election. \nOne thing is, it's possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ \nIf the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? \nIt is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. \nSo those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. \nBut if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year's primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group's bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nIt would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. \nIn such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be ※fair§ until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. \nMeanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. \nAnd CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ \nAn artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. \nMogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. \nThe AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. \nWithout Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. \nSo if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. \nAt this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.

    "text": "B y BAR executive editor Glen Ford B arack Obama tried to woo Republicans into a ※Grand Bargain§ that would have gutted Social Security. Bill Clinton let loose the banks. But Donald Trump's destruction of the Republican Party will allow Hillary Clinton to ※gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle.§ The rich are about to get their best deal yet. ※The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class.§ When Donald Trump took a wrecking ball to the Republican Party he provided the unexpected catalyst for completion of the corporate project begun by Bill Clinton, Al Gore and other white Democrats in the 1980s, with the founding of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). To counter relentless attrition of whites to the GOP in their home states, these beleaguered, mostly southern Democrats sought national corporate funding to turn their party decisively to the right. They reckoned, correctly, that a steady stream of corporate capital would allow them to control the new wave of Black voters and politicians that had been mobilized by Rev. Jesse Jackson's two presidential campaigns, while strengthening the hand of the South in national Democratic Party calculations. Bill Clinton became the first DLC president in 1992, and moved swiftly and methodically to narrow the ideological differences between the duopoly parties. He completed much of Ronald Reagan's agenda, claiming it as his own; destroyed welfare ※as we knew it§; vastly expanded the mass Black Incarceration regime; pushed NAFTA through Congress over the objections of majorities in his own party; engineered the corporate monopolization of broadcast media; and removed the last safety straps from Wall Street banks. ※Clinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo.§ In foreign affairs, Clinton initiated what was to become the doctrine of ※humanitarian§ military intervention, dismantling and partially occupying the socialist nation of Yugoslavia. In the process, Clinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo, thus keeping operational the network created by the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Pakistan during the previous decade in Afghanistan. In Africa, Clinton conspired with Uganda and exiled Tutsi rebels to overthrow the Hutu majority government in Rwanda, setting off a bloodbath in 1994, followed two years later by an invasion of Congo that has killed more than six million people 〞 and still counting. Barack Obama was the second DLC president (although he lies [3] about his membership). He, too, moved with unseemly haste to reach a ※Grand Bargain§ with the GOP 〞 not of necessity, since he had won a huge electoral mandate with the overwhelming financial backing of Wall Street, but as a matter of ideological principle. In January of 2009, before even taking the oath of office, Obama told the editorial boards of the New York Times and the Washington Post that all ※entitlements,§ including Medicare and Social Security, would be ※ on the table [4] § for cutting in his administration. Obama's first project, now considered the centerpiece of his legacy, was to resurrect the rightwing Heritage Foundation's corporate health insurance scheme, adopted by Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole in 1996, and made into state law by Republican Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, in 2006. Obama's Affordable Care Act was, literally, written by lobbyists for the insurance and drug industries, and is now collapsing like a poorly constructed house at the end of its mortgage. ※For the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his ＆Grand Bargain.'§ With the Democratic majority in Congress in no mood to tamper with Social Security and Medicare, Obama tried to maneuver the targeted entitlements into a financial crisis trap. He named two dependable reactionaries, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, as co-chairmen of his National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility, also called the Commission on Deficit Reduction. They dutifully recommended $4 trillion in budget cuts, mostly to social programs, including cuts to Social Security. Although the full commission did not endorse the chairs' recommendations, and the Congress failed to pass bills modeled on the document, Obama used the Simpson-Bowles formula as a basis for negotiating what he hoped would be a ※bipartisan§ (GOP plus Obama and a minority of Democrats) massacre of entitlements. For the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his ※Grand Bargain.§ Congressional Black Caucus chairman Emanuel Cleaver, of Kansas City, called the deal a ※ Satan's Sandwich [5] ,§ but Obama continued to pursue a political marriage made in hell until the 2012 reelection campaign clock called a halt to the spectacle. ※A de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie.§ The quest for a Grand Bargain was Barack Obama's failed attempt to best Bill Clinton in erasing the distinctions between the two major parties 每 to create a de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie. It was the Republicans who ran away from the altar. And the Democrats did eat much of the Satan's Sandwich, through sequestration and austerity that ravaged social programs by other means. Why did the Republicans reject the deal? Although both halves of the duopoly ultimately answer to Wall Street, the Republicans, like any other party, have an institutional interest in winning office. It is true that Obama had crafted a deal that any Republican would love, but it was still his deal, and he planned to run for reelection as an historical dealmaker. Probably just as importantly, the Republican Party is the White Man's party, meaning, white supremacy is its organizing principle, central to its identity among much of the masses. To embrace Obama, no matter how advantageous to their big business patrons, was a hug too far for the GOP. Racism doomed the Grand Bargain 每 Hallelujah! A New, Bigger Bargain Recently released Wikileaks emails reveal Hillary Clinton speaking to bankers at Morgan Stanley in 2013, a year after the debacle. ※The Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right,§ she said. Thanks to Donald Trump's demolition of the Republican Party, the conditions have been created for Hillary Clinton, as DLC President #3, to achieve what #1 and #2 could not: gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle. With most of the ruling class and its attendants having vacated the building, the Republican Party has been reduced to Donald Trump and his ※deplorables,§ as Hillary calls them. Trump's opposition to corporate trade deals violated the Holy Grail against prohibiting capitalists from moving money and jobs around the world as they see fit, and his reluctance to support regime change as an inherent right of American exceptionalism has frightened and outraged the military industrial complex, the national security establishment, and all sectors dependent on the maintenance of empire. ※An inherently unstable arrangement.§ Clinton's Big Tent is not a temporary, election season dwelling. It is how she plans to govern. The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class, while at the same time the party nominally represents most of the folks who are abused and misused by that ruling class. It is an inherently unstable arrangement, and will soon be wracked by splits, as a post-Trump GOP attempts to lure its fat cats back and the darker and poorer constituencies consigned to the latrine area of Hillary's high class tent break to the Left for air. But in the interim, Clinton will have a unique opportunity to cut grand austerity deals with all the ※big elements§ of Simpson-Bowles, to renege on her corporate trade promises, and to wage war with great gusto in the name of a ※united§ country. Ever since the Democratic National Convention it has been clear that the Clintonites are encouraged to consider everyone outside of their grand circle to be suspect, subversive, or depraved. Their inclusive rhetoric is really an invocation of a ruling class consensus, now that Trump has supposedly brought the ruling class together under one banner. In Hillary's tent, the boardrooms are always in session. Source URL: http://blackagendareport.com/hillary_big_tent_grand_bargain",

    "title": "Obama: Hillary Clinton Pardon Could Heal Divided Nation",
    "text": "Note to President Obama: a Hillary Clinton pardon could heal a divided nation. After all, if it was good enough for Richard Nixon, it is certainly good enough for Clinton. The difference being that Tricky Dicky was actually guilty of the crimes insinuated against him, whereas the former Secretary of State, who was thoroughly investigated and cleared of any criminal wrongdoing twice, continues to be maligned and persecuted by the right-wing establishment, as well as politicos with decades-old grudges who view the Clinton witch hunt as their opportunity to exact revenge on the woman who should be America's first female President of the United States , and proved it by carrying the nation's popular vote if not the antiquated electoral college.\nAs originally proposed by one-time presidential hopeful, Rev. Jesse Jackson, the nation should call upon President Barack Obama to issue a blanket pardon to the twice-exonerated Clinton, in order to call an end to the drawn-out attack on every aspect of the former New York senator's character once and for all. In the 21st century, it is unthinkable to believe that U.S. citizens are so narrow-minded and circumspect that they seek to stop an empowered, idolized public servant from holding the highest office in the nation simply because she is a woman.\nWhile it is abominable and heartbreaking to lend credence to this theory, there is strong evidence to support its existence, especially when considering some examples from other nations who have female world leaders:\n〞 Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (1966-77; 1980 to Oct. 31, 1984 (her assassination))\n〞 British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1979-90). Thatcher was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and first woman to have held the office.\n〞 Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (1969-74)\n〞 German Chancellor Angela Merkel (2005-present)\n〞 Queen Elizabeth II of United Kingdom (U.K.), Great Britain, and Northern Ireland (1952-present)\n〞 South Korean President Park Geun-hye (2013-present)\n〞 Prime Minister Theresa May of U.K., Great Britain, and Northern Ireland (2016-present)\n〞 Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed of Bangladesh (1996-2001; 2009-present)\nFrom countries great and small, these women and countless others have achieved the ultimate seat of power in their respective nations. Some of these countries have a long, storied legacy of woman leaders that spans decades and even generations, while others are relatively new to welcoming a female presence as their central figurehead. Nonetheless, women all over the globe have been given the opportunity to lead their countries into a new era and provide their citizens with a different perspective, with the glaring exception of the United States, a nation that could benefit immensely from female influence at the helm.\nPresidential pardons are not a foreign concept. Every U.S. president has the authority to grant pardons, which is also known as clemency, to anyone of their choosing. However, unlike most executive powers, presidential pardons are unchecked by Congress and cannot be blocked, overturned, or reviewed. The purpose of this power exists to help ease tensions, correct historic injustices, and heal political wounds. If any situation calls for its implementation, this scenario could not be more fitting. Yet, this authority does not come without controversy. In addition to President Gerald Ford's pardoning of Richard Nixon in 1974, other controversial acts of clemency include President Bill Clinton's pardon of Symbionese Liberation Army sympathizer and publishing heiress Patty Hearst in 2001, President Richard Nixon's offer of clemency to Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa in 1971, and President Jimmy Carter's commutation of Watergate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy's prison sentence in 1977.\nAs evidenced by the vitriol of the 2016 Campaign and subsequent General Election , a Hillary Clinton pardon by President Obama could be the only way to end the vicious cycle of recrimination and violence observed throughout the so-called Democratic process , which has encountered its own foibles and criticisms. Namely, the ongoing debate about the necessity of the electoral college and its all-or-nothing allotment, which many consider unjust and obsolete. Instead, many believe the winner of the popular vote should be elected as U.S. commander in chief, which would have resulted in President-elect Clinton occupying the Oval Office. In the aftermath of the controversial election results, a blanket pardon for the veteran politician could be the first step in healing a divided nation, which has truly demonstrated its fractured populace via the chaotic antics and disdainful actions observed throughout the extended 2016 Campaign cycle, as well as in the aftermath of its divisive conclusion.\nOpinion Written and Edited by Leigh Haugh\nSources:\nPersonal Opinions and Observations of the Author\nDetroit Free Press 每Obama Should Pardon Hillary Clinton, Jesse Jackson Says\nNew York Times 每Hillary Clinton, in Emotional Speech, Implores Supporters to Keep Believing in America\nMTV 每We Need Female Politicians Now More Than Ever\nWashington Post 每Here Are the Dozens of Democracies That Have Elected a Female Leader\nAll Article Images Courtesy of WikiMedia Commons 每 Creative Commons License clinton , Donald Trump , Hillary Clinton , jesse jackson , President Barack Obama , Presidential Pardons",

    "title": "Obama Legacy: Medical Tyranny? New Order Issued for Detainment and Quarantines",
    "text": "Forced vaccinations are already common around the world, and President Obama's Executive Order may make this a reality in the U.S. also. Photo courtesy of Dawn.com . \nby Paul Fassa Health Impact News \nAlmost on the eve of the 2016 presidential election, outgoing president Barack Obama issued an executive order that is intended to coordinate all the world's health agencies in alignment with the CDC's intention to increase detainment and quarantining guidelines enforcement worldwide. \nExecutive orders (EO) are legally binding as laws, though an incoming president can issue EOs to cancel or revise some of those issued by the previous president. They are handy for an administration to avoid Congressional delays and conflicts, which can create unfavorable amendments or nullifying it completely. \nCongress can also amend executive orders and the Supreme Court can nullify them. But those are lengthy and give the administration involved time to enforce the executive order through the executive branches several agencies, including the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services. \nThe executive branch can end-around Congress to create statutes and enforceable policies with executive orders, euphemistically called ※presidential memoranda§ these days. Executive Order to be Used Against Vaccine Resistance? \nThis recent executive order is of grave concern for advocates of health freedom. It is called ※Advancing the Global Health Security Agenda to Achieve a World Safe and Secure from Infectious Disease Threats,§ and it was signed and issued on November 4 th , 2016. \nIt seems innocuous at first glance, but one set of initials shows up often, GHSA . It stands for Global Health Security Agenda. \nThis term first appeared in a CDC proposal in 2014, during the Disney measles outbreak. This proposal focused mostly on its ※vaccine package.§ It rested comfortably on the nationally orchestrated outcry against vaccination resistance . Some journalists even suggested jailing parents who did not have their children vaccinated. \nSeveral state legislators jumped in with proposals to create laws mandating vaccinations by removing exemptions previously allowed and not allowing kids to attend school without vaccine compliance. Fortunately for the rest of the nation, only California succeeded completely with State Senator Pan's push of SB 277 despite strong grassroots opposition. \nThe hysteria made it into presidential politics. Congressional Senator Bernie Sanders, who was vying to become the Democratic presidential nominee, declared in so many words that unvaccinated children are killers prior to his attempted run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. \nDemocratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton openly declared: \n※The science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and vaccines work. Let's protect all our kids.§ \nAll this innocently ignorant or pharmaceutical industry rewarded hysteria was perfect timing for the CDC to set the goals expected to be implemented within five years of 2015. Here is some of their 2014 ※suggested§ policy that is now framed within Obama's recent Executive Order: A functioning national vaccine delivery system that is able to respond to new disease threats. At least 90% coverage of the country's fifteen-month-old population with at least one dose of measles containing vaccines. Note: The CDC's doctored Atlanta children vaccine 2004 study threw out evidence proving children under three years of age were vulnerable to autism from the MMR, per testimony and original documents provided by CDC whistleblower Dr. William Thompson . The CDC claimed in this document that their emphasis on measles serves as a proxy for what they consider ※vaccine preventable disease (VPD)§ compliance. It also helps that most of the nation was swept up in pro-vaccination hysteria after the not so large Disney measles outbreak that resulted in no deaths. In other words, the CDC is seeking absolute 90 percent plus compliance eventually with all VPDs, even as records of outbreaks among highly vaccinated populations prove vaccines are not so effective after all. A fact denied is how extremely dangerous vaccines are and how they create lowered health among those spared serious acute vaccine injuries. (Source) \nThis late 2014 CDC document is the root of Obama's recent (November 4, 2016) executive order that grants worldwide government health agency cooperation and police power, even from Interpol (The International Criminal Police Organization (ICPO). \nAlso mentioned as sources of policing the unvaccinated and suspected disease carriers in this are the Department of Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security. Serious policing, indeed. More CDC Vaccination Policy to Bolster Their 2014 Policy ※Suggestions§ \nTo bolster the initial 2014 vaccine package, the CDC issued a proposed directive for isolating and quarantining suspected disease carriers in August of 2016. This time it was a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) in the Federal Register to amend the Public Health Service Act, which governs public health law. \nIt's uncertain if public feedback, allowed until October 14th, 2016, had any influence on this CDC proposal to amend public health policy or not. \nNational Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) founder Barbara Loe Fisher was on the forefront of public feedback, leading an NVIC petition to the CDC. Over 15,000 comments overall were sent to the CDC, mostly protesting this latest move toward medical tyranny. \nOften the FDA, USDA, or CDC's opening for public commentary is merely a procedural formality that has little to no effect on the outcome. This has apparently happened once again. \nThe CDC's recent NPRM makes it possible for anyone, including those who are employed in travel services, to be a snitch and report suspected illness . Isolation can extend to a 72 hour detainment to determine one's potential or actual disease level and enforce treatment or vaccination as a condition for being released. \nAfter you've been released, you could be electronically monitored. As usual, the viral shedding of vaccinated individuals that spreads disease is ignored. Jail time and large fines can be used against those who refuse to cooperate. \nPage 32 of this 88 page NPRM document gives examples of quarantining passengers of commercial aircraft and ocean going vessels under the heading of CONTACT INVESTIGATION (CI) CRITERIA BY DISEASE. \nSeveral life threatening diseases are mentioned, including Ebola, MERS, SARS, TB, and others, as well as measles . Most CIs thus far are measles cases. According to this document, CIs should be isolated according to their proximity of an individual with symptoms of any of the diseases listed. How they're handled is advised in the column with the heading ※Recommended activities.§ \nHere's the recommended activity for those in proximity of traveling measles cases (verbatim): ※MMR vaccination if unvaccinated and <72 hrs since exposure; immune globulin if indicated and within 6 days of exposure.§ (Source) False Media Fear Hysteria Helps Promote Medical Tyranny \nThere's a chain of historical events that demonstrate the disaster of enforced vaccination policies, starting with the cowpox vaccine for small pox in England and elsewhere, excerpted from NaturoDoc.com. \n＃ compulsory smallpox vaccination campaigns in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that played a major role in decimating the populations of Japan (48,000 deaths), England and Wales (44,840 deaths, after 97 percent of the population had been vaccinated), Scotland, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, Holland, Italy, India (3 million 〞 all vaccinated), Australia, Germany (124,000 deaths), Prussia (69,000 deaths 〞 all re-vaccinated), and the Philippines. The epidemics ended in cities where smallpox vaccinations were either discontinued or never begun, and also after sanitary reforms were instituted (most notably in Munich 〞 1880, Leicester 〞 1878, Barcelona 〞 1804, Alicante 〞 1827, India 〞 1906, etc). [Emphasis added] (Source) \nFast forward to the Swine Flu episode that led to legislated vaccine industry exemption from liability lawsuits. This episode occurred in 1976, where one Army boot camp trainee fell ill, but went on a forced full pack march and died. His was the only death from that flu. But many died or were paralyzed from the vaccine rather than the flu. Here's that story . \nMore recently, another Swine Flu scare was exposed as false by intrepid CBS News producer Sharyl Attkinson, author of the book Stonewalled . \nHer investigative pursuit for actual facts regarding vaccines may have helped force her ※resignation§ from CBS. She and her team were investigating the 2009 and previous year's Swine Flu, which was classified as a pandemic or worldwide epidemic based solely on the numbers of purported stricken victims. \nAfter the CDC announced they were no longer tracking Swine Flu incidents and deaths, Sharyl and her team wanted to know why, but the CDC refused to respond. \nUsing Freedom of Information Act's (FOI) provisions, they went to each state's Board of Health agency and discovered the actual count of H1N1 Swine Flu cases was incredibly low, single digits in some states. The majority of actual cases were not even any version of the flu. \nThe CDC responded by publicly claiming there were a million or more H1N1 cases in the USA alone, and millions worldwide. The CDC and WHO simply lied about the whole thing and got away with it. (Source) \nCDC and WHO epidemics are psy-ops (psychological operations) designed to create hysteria and have everyone roll up their sleeves to receive those shots that enrich vaccine makers' coffers. And flu shot adverse reactions are the most commonly represented in the government's vaccine court , the legislatively designated ※buffer§ protecting the vaccine industry from direct lawsuits. \nWhat large scale death toll has occurred from any of the several contagious diseases covered by mainstream media over the past few decades since that 1976 Swine Flu debacle? None. \nYet whether Ebola or Zika or SARs or MERs or Bird Flu or Swine Flu, the hysterical fear mongering has its way on mainstream media as though it's factual, actual, and pressing. \nThe original 1956 movie ※Invasion of the Body Snatchers§ and its 1978 remake of the same name, both of which coined the term ※pod people,§ were about humans overtaken and recreated in pods, which then become obedient drones for the masterminds of invading aliens. \nThey are beyond Sci-Fi.

    "text": "http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/bombshell-obama-clinton-podesta-soros.html The following information is a new and chilling piece of the Podesta-Clinton email puzzle. It has even stronger connections to pedophilia and Satanism and connects some of the most influential people in the US, including: Barack Obama, George Soros , John Podesta , Tony Podesta, convicted billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and James Alefantis who is \"one of DC's 50 most powerful people\". You will learn that George Soros donated $20k to 'Comet Ping Pong' pizza restaurant, owned by James Alefantis and where Obama goes frequently and even held a fundraiser. According to one email, Barack \"Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party.\" Lady Gaga (left) also attended Marina Abramovic's (right) Spirit Cooking Satanic \"dinner\" (it involves a mixture of blood, semen and breast milk) Pizza and [hot-]dogs are alleged pedophile codes for \"young girls\" and \"young boys.\" You will see more references for yourself and, put into a wider perspective, the codes make sense. In the following infographic, by connecting the people in the 'Podesta Emails' and their alleged 'pedophilia codes' you will see strong references to: sex with children of both sexes and various ages ( pedophilia codes , such as: pizza = young girl, hotdog = young boy, etc.) images from the Satanic 'Spirit Cooking' dinner hosted by \"artist\" Marina Abramovic and attended by John Podesta and his brother Tony, James Alefantis, Lady Gaga, etc. leaked picture of John Podesta making reference to \"elite\" god Osiris, which was murdered and chopped into 14 pieces: references to Moloch, the god of child sacrifice multiple references to murder and cannibalism shady images of children posted by James Alefantis with the already mentioned pedophilia hashtags business logos that are very similar to symbols used by pedophiles to identify sexual preferences pizza restaurants that are possibly connected to this alleged Satanic network of pedophiles and child killers pictures of a metallic coffin pictures of an empty underground room containing the hashtags #killroom and #murder And let's not forget the \"Sacrificing a Chicken to Moloch\" email , where \"chicken\" is believed to be a code-word for \"child.\" You can study the infographic here .

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/obama-pushes-fake-news-talking-point.html This piece can be seen as a continuation of \" Red Alert: The War on Alternative Media Has Begun .\" As Democrats and Hillary Clinton supporters come to terms with a Donald Trump administration, the ＆fake news won him the election' talking point was pushed to new heights as the outgoing president suggested ＆fake' media websites are undermining the political process. ※If we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not＃ if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,§ Obama said during a news conference in Germany. Obama suggested that ＆fake news' affects voter opinions of candidates ※in an age where there is so much active misinformation, and it's packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or turn on your television.§Yes folks, the alternative or ＆fake' media is now able to look the same as CNN, which interviews its own camera people and tells viewers that they are protesters. ※If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won't know what to protect,§ Obama said. ※We won't know what to fight for.§ In other words, Obama is saying that the rigged playing field has now been leveled, and that's a problem for the establishment. ※Part of what's changed in politics is social media and how people are receiving information,§ he went on to say, adding ※It's easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communicate complex policies. But we'll figure it out.§ Yeah, because the mainstream media certainly doesn't engage in negative attacks or simplistic slogans. As we have documented, the ＆fake news' talking point originated with a far left SJW writer , who spread around a list of websites to avoid if you want ＆real news'. The list included Infowars and Breitbart News. The idea is to attempt to force Google & Facebook to censor conservative websites. The talking point also dovetails with Twitter promising to purge numerous accounts belonging to members of the ＆Alt-Right', egged on by partisan groups like The Southern Poverty Law Center. Other web tools, such as Quantcast jumped on the bandwagon and introduced tools to identify the so called ＆fake news' sites. However, the move has rapidly backfired , as people quickly realized the whole talking point is part of a bitter backlash tantamount to censorship . Meanwhile, the Mainstream Media has been caught faking news countless times, which had serious consequences worldwide:",

    "text": "For those of us too ensnared in the Trumpster fire to pay attention to anything substantive, a majorly screwed up thing was happening to our fighting men and women. The LA Times broke the story that the Department of Defense has been ordering almost 10,000 one-time National Guardsmen from California to pay back enlistment bonuses due to an error over a decade ago. Horror stories began pouring in of soldiers being notified that they MUST pay back the money or face wage garnishments, tax liens and interest charges. \nThis, of course, prompted the Obama administration to take immediate action while our do-nothing Republican Congress focuses on such important issues as defunding Obamacare. \nDefense Secretary Ash Carter announced today that the Pentagon will suspend efforts to recoup bonuses overpaid to troops more than a decade ago. ※There is no more important responsibility for the Department of Defense than keeping faith with our people. That means treating them fairly and equitably, honoring their service and sacrifice, and keeping our word,§ Carter added. \nOf course, Republicans love to wear the biggest flag pins they can find and feign love for the troops come reelection time, but really put their words into action. This might explain why they did NOTHING to stop this. \nIt seems the California National Guard told the state's members of Congress two years ago that the Pentagon was making every effort at taking back its promised re-enlistment bonuses from thousands of soldiers. In fact, the California National Guard went so far as to develop a plan to assuage the problem. However, being the greedy do-nothing leaches that they are, the Republican-led Congress didn't lift a finger. \nOnce again, the Obama Administration is forced to step in and help the very people Republicans claim to love so much. \nFeatured image via Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Share this Article!",

When he sat down with the host of Full Frontal this week, the result was simply priceless. \nBee took a few shots at him for his age, asking if he would consider an appearance on Antique Roadshow and pointing out the white in his hair. Obama reminded her that he was still president, after all, but Bee was hell bent on making this an interview to remember. \nShe finally asked Obama if he would ※mess§ with Donald Trump once he was done serving as Commander in Chief. \n※After you leave office, have you thought of just whispering in Donald Trump's ear, ＆You were right, I wasn't born here,' just to, like, mess with him?§ Bee asked. \n※I think it's fair to say that I will be organizing my post-presidency where I'm not close enough to him to whisper into his ear,§ Obama shot back. \nThey did discuss some important issues, such as young voters and the struggles that Hillary Clinton may face as the first woman to serve as President of the United States.

Suffice it to say, Obama had the best reaction to a protester ever. Hands down. So, of course, Trump had to start lying about what happened. \nSpeaking to a crowd in Hershey, PA, Trump said that the president had done quite literally the exact opposite of what he actually did . \n※You saw it today on television, right? He was talking to the protester, screaming at him, really screaming at him. By the way, if I spoke the way Obama spoke to that protester, they would say, ※He became unhinged!

When the protester interrupted him, the crowd was not having it. He struggled to quiet them as they chanted ※Hillary,§ and when he succeeded, he began by reminding them of all the reasons they should treat this man with respect. Obama defended the protester's First Amendment rights and then told those in attendance that this is what he means when he says they aren't ※focused.§ He concluded with his now trademark phrase, ※Don't boo, VOTE!§ \nWatch President Obama show how to handle a protester with class, here: Obama just lost control of the crowd in North Carolina which was shouting down a Trump supporter; Obama defended the guy's right to protest pic.twitter.com/bTjHPvadcj \n〞 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) November 4, 2016 \nFeatured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images and Joe Raedle/Getty Images Share this Article!",

    "text": "November 7, 2016 Michelle Obama Warns That ＆Playing Around With A Protest Vote' Will Lead To A Trump Win (VIDEO)   \nSpeaking at Hillary Clinton's rally in Philadelphia on the eve of the election, Michelle Obama had a warning for American voters: Choosing not to vote or casting a protest vote will put Donald Trump in the White House. \nThe first lady also tried to make sure that the voters listening to her speech, whether in person or on television, understand just how important their vote really is. \n※And here's the beauty of it all, this election is on us. It is on us. If we get out and vote tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will win,§ she said. ※But, if we stay home or if we play around with a protest vote, then Hillary's opponent will win. Period. End of story.§ \n※Look, it is important to understand that presidential elections are breathtakingly close. They are decided by just 5, 10, 15 votes per precinct,§ she added. \nMichelle Obama's passionate plea comes after a long and contentious campaign. Some people are convinced their vote doesn't matter. Some people are still pouting because their favorite candidate didn't win the primary. Others have swallowed the kool-aid and believe both candidates are the same. But Michelle Obama is right, not voting or voting for a third party candidate is the same as casting a vote for Trump. Quite frankly, there is just too much at stake for that this time around. \nWatch Michelle Obama give warn Americans about the importance of their vote, here: \nFeatured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Share this Article!",

    "text": "In what amounts to the first pang of just how profound America's Election Day screw up truly was, Trump's campaign is reportedly already working on a plan to scrub that last eight years of progress out of existence on Trump's very first day in office . No Obama accomplishment will remain. They even have a name for the plan: The First Day Project. \nOrganized by the Heritage Foundation, the goal is to deprive Obama of any lasting effect to his time in office. It's a perverse sort of vengeance from a group of clowns who have spent the last decade smearing the president at every possible step of the way. \nTrump aides are organizing what one Republican close to the campaign calls the First Day Project. ※Trump spends several hours signing papers〞and erases the Obama Presidency,§ he said. Stephen Moore, an official campaign adviser who is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, explained, ※We want to identify maybe twenty-five executive orders that Trump could sign literally the first day in office.§ \nThinking back over Obama's list of wins 每 from gay rights to healthcare to the economy 每 the idea that these achievements can be erased by a collective of spiteful, bitter men in a matter of hours is almost too much to bear. The suffering to the people whose rights will surely be rolled back will be immense. \nAnd on a separate, but equally terrifying front, Trump's campaign surrogate Omarosa told reporters that Trump has been compiling an ※enemies list§每 an assortment of people on the right and left who openly stood against him 每 and he plans on punishing those on the list when he gets to office. \n※I would never judge anybody for exercising their right to and the freedom to choose who they want. But let me just tell you, Mr. Trump has a long memory and we're keeping a list.§ \nErase his predecessor, punish his enemies. In this way, with pen and sword, Trump plans to dismantle a democracy. The oldest, greatest one in the world 每 up until the point when it wasn't. \nFeatured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Share this Article!",

    "text": "Trump spent five years spreading racist lies meant to convince people Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States. He spent the 2016 election calling him the worst president of all time. And upon finally meeting President Obama face-to-face＃ he now says he likes him? \nIn one of the oddest tweets Trump has ever sent, the president-elect said he had a ※really good meeting§ and ※great chemistry§ (what?) with Obama. He added that his wife really liked Michelle Obama, as well. A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot! \n〞 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 \n※Chemistry?§ Really? What a creep. \nThe feeling did not appear to be mutual. After the meeting, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that the two men had views that were so radically different from one another that neither man even tried to discuss them during their first meeting. Obama also reiterated that he stood by calling Trump ※ unfit § for office. \nAsked whether the President still considers Trump ※temperamentally unfit§ and ※uniquely unqualified§ after the pair met for the first time Thursday morning, Earnest said that Obama stood by those remarks. \n※Look, the president's views haven't changed,§ Earnest said. ※He stands by what he said on the campaign trail. He had an opportunity to make his argument. He made that argument vigorously. He made that argument in states all across the country. But the American people decided.§ \nIt was also reported that the Obamas decided to cancel a photo op with Donald and Melania Trump scheduled for after the meeting. (The White House denied that anything was meant by the cancellation, naturally.) \nTrump's sudden aboutface on Obama only reinforces what many had suspected all along. His nasty remarks, his damaging rhetoric, his vicious smears on the president were all lies he used as a blunt force instrument to convince his base to vote for him. He knew they were lies when he said them, he simply didn't care if they were being used to destroy Obama's reputation to get what he wanted. Now that he's won the election, those lies have outgrown their usefulness. \nBut lest one think this represents a ※pivot§ to maturity, just eight minutes later, he promptly descended into a temper tantrum unbecoming of a president. Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! \n〞 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 \nThe man who up until the day of the election was screaming about rigged voting machines and illegal voters suddenly thinks protesting his election is ※very unfair.§ He also tapped into his favorite few scapegoats 每※professional protesters§ (i.e. Democrats) and the media. In one tweet, we get a glimpse at just how ugly Trump's administration will be. People who criticize him will be publicly attacked by the president himself. The media who covers him will be demonized. And Trump will spend more time whining than governing. \nPathetic. \nFeatured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Share this Article!",

    "text": "By Jameson Parker Election 2016 , Politics November 10, 2016 Obama Just Did Something To Spite Trump On The President-Elect's Very First Visit To The White House   \nNobody is more disgusted and disappointed in the election results than President Barack Obama, whose legacy of progress is poised to be undone overnight by a belligerent con man. And apparently the first meeting between current and future presidents was off to a rocky start 每 culminating with Obama abruptly breaking with tradition and not giving Trump the satisfaction of a publicity win on this sad day. \nAccording to reporters at the White House , Obama cancelled a planned ※photo op§ with Trump shortly after meeting him, depriving the president-elect of the chance to appear alongside the current president and gain an air of legitimacy. \nThe Obamas canceled a photo-op of the current and future first couples outside the south entrance of the White House. In his first visit to the White House after the 2008 election, Mr. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama posed for the cameras alongside President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush. The decision not to participate in this tradition illustrates how bitter the campaign was, particularly for Mrs. Obama who delivered some of the most emotional arguments against electing Mr. Trump. \nIt may also suggest that Obama's first meeting with Trump went about as badly as expected. The president had hoped to press Trump on the importance of governing the country with a semblance of dignity, as well as making the case that spending his first day in office signing a bunch of executive orders to erase Obama's legacy out of spite would be a horrific start to his time in office. It appears that Trump was not in the a mood to listen. \nMr. Earnest said Mr. Obama would go through with Mr. Trump the policies he has implemented that he hopes his successor won't undo. But Mr. Trump is expected to attempt to unravel much of Mr. Obama's legacy, with plans to reverse his policies on health care, climate change, immigration and government regulations, and to dramatically shift his foreign-policy approach. \nThe fact that Obama would break this tradition 每 a symbolic gesture of the peaceful transition of power 每 implies he is keenly aware that the man about to take over is a walking, talking disaster. A pathological liar and narcissist who has surrounded himself with a team of goons that he can count on to tell him what he wants to here and claw their way up his coattails at every chance. No photo op is going to change this tragedy from unfolding. \nFeatured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images Share this Article!",

    "text": "0 comments \nThe White house is refusing to deny the rumors that President Obama claimed he will relocate to Canada if Donald Trump is elected as his successor in November. \nThe rumor began when Canadian satire website The Burred Street Journal ran a fictional story titled ※Obama Declares His Family Will Move To Canada If Trump Is Elected.§ \nThe story was complete with a fake statement from Obama which read, ※It's something Michelle, the kids and I have discussed as a potential solution to the Donald. I have also spoken with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau who outlined Canada's generous immigration policy for wealthy individuals, so we'll see.§ \nThe story was immediately picked up by American newsrooms, who ran it with headlines like ※Obama Just Said He's Moving If Trump Is Elected, Sounds Good To Us!§ \nWhen asked about the rumors, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would not say outright that Obama is not considering a move to Canada should the American people elect Trump. \n※He's working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn't support,§ said Earnest, according to MRC Blog . \nWhile this all originated as a rumor, the White House's decision not to categorically deny the reports had any validity only makes it appear as though Obama may actually consider moving out of the country if Trump is elected. \nDo you think Obama would ever leave the US?

    "text": "0 comments Obama was speaking to donors at a private fundraiser in California when he railed against former House Oversight Committee Chair Darrell Issa for calling his administration corrupt. \n※Here's a guy who called my administration perhaps the most corrupt in history 〞 despite the fact that actually we have not had a major scandal in my administration,§ Obama said! \nObama has had more scandals than any president in history! Just because the MSM refuses to report on them does not mean they do not exist! \nBreitbart reports : \nIssa was the key figure in several investigations of the Obama administration, including the Fast and Furious debacle with Attorney General Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton's failure in Benghazi, the failures in the Veterans Affairs department, and the IRS using its power to target conservative Tea Party groups for investigations. \nObama accused Issa of wasting taxpayer money ※on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere.§ \n※This guy has spent all his time simply trying to obstruct, to feed the same sentiments that resulted in Donald Trump becoming their nominee,§ Obama said. \nWe could list 77 scandals, but here are just 7 of the biggest! \n1.) IRS Targeting Scandal \nIn 2013, Lois Lerner, former director of the IRS Exempt Organizations division, admitted that officials in the IRS' Cincinnati office acted improperly. 2.) VA Waiting List \nThe Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general first noted the waiting list problem at a Phoenix clinic in 2014 and then found other clinics with similar problems. Veterans were placed on phony waiting lists, and some even died while waiting for care. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned from his position. 3.) GSA Spending Spree \nIn 2012, Martha N. Johnson, the administrator of the General Services Administration, resigned after the federal procurement agency was engulfed in a controversy. The department was accused of allowing excessive spending on travel and conferences for the agency and employees. 4.) Attack on the Benghazi Compound \nOn Sept. 11, 2012, weeks before a presidential election, terrorists attacked U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya. Obama administration officials initially blamed this attack on a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim YouTube video that spun out of control. 5.) Clinton Emails \nIt was the Benghazi committee that first discovered that before, during, and after her time as secretary of state, Clinton maintained a private email server. This prompted the FBI to investigate questions of whether Clinton violated the law in terms of storing classified information. 6.) Fast and Furious Gun Walking \nOperation Fast and Furious was a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives program, meant to be a sting operation. It allowed about 2,000 guns to flow to Mexican drug trafficking organizations under federal supervision before authorities lost control of the guns. 7.) Solyndra Subsidies \nThe Energy Department provided a $535 million loan guarantee to the politically connected solar panel firm Solyndra as part of the 2009 stimulus bill. Not long after building its factory, the California firm filed for bankruptcy protection and an FBI investigation ensued. The company did not find a buyer and eventually closed down. So Barack Obama＃just shut up!",

    "text": "0 comments \nEarlier this year, in a speech to the African Union while in Ethiopia, President Obama said, ※I actually think I'm a pretty good president. I think if I ran again, I could win. But I can't. The law is the law, and no one person is above the law, not even the president.§ \nObama may say he is not above the law, but it is abundantly clear that he thinks he is. He may need his head examined, though, if he actually believes he has been a ※good president.§ ISIS is running rampant worldwide, the national debt has skyrocketed, and Obamacare has been a massive failure, just to name a few things. \nNow, the American people have spoken out in a poll. Apparently, they are not very happy that the president took it upon himself to assume they would vote for him a third time around. News flash, Mr. President, but many of us DID NOT vote for you the first or second time to begin with! \nAccording to the Rasmussen Reports poll, only one-third of Americans would vote for Obama if he ran for a third term, assuming that was constitutionally possible. Perhaps the president needs a refresher course on fractions, because one-third isn't exactly a majority＃ \nThe results of the poll get worse for Obama, though. The amount of Democrats who would vote for him a third time is only 57 percent. That's just a little better than half of the members of his own party. Turns out, we're not the only ones who can't wait for him to vacate the White House! \nThe Conservative Post reports that Rasmussen also showed that 63 percent of all likely voters would not support a third term. Even among independents, 68 percent would vote for another candidate. 93 percent of Republicans would not vote for Obama for a third term, and we're a little worried about that other 7 percent. \nSHARE this report if you think Barack Obama is one of the WORST presidents in the history of America, NOT one of the best!",

    "text": "0 comments \nA bit of good news to kick off your weekend＃ \nIn an interview on the ＆Sway in the Morning' radio show on Friday, President Obama stated unequivocally that his wife will ※never run§ for political office. \n※She will never run for office,§ said Obama of the 52-year-old First Lady. ※She is as talented and brilliant a person as there is, and I could not be prouder of her, but Michelle does not have the patience or the inclination to actually be a candidate herself. That's one thing y'all can take to the bank.§ \nMichelle Obama has become Hillary Clinton's most effective surrogate on the campaign trail this election season, delivering powerful speeches on behalf of the Democratic nominee whom she hopes will become her husband's successor. \nThe First Lady's success on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton has only led her supporters to push for her to launch her own political career, though she has long denied that she has any desire to run for political office. \nIndeed, it seems Michelle Obama is much more content living the high life, jet-setting around the world on expensive vacations, using only the most luxurious of accommodations, and paying for none of it herself. That's for the lowly taxpayers like you and me to do＃ \nWhy hold a job or work to curry favor with the American people when your lavish lifestyle has been handed to you on a silver platter? Considering this, it's really no surprise Michelle Obama does not wish to run for office after her husband's term is over, and for that, we are grateful. \nSHARE this report if you are glad to hear that Michelle Obama will not seek political office after she vacates the White House in the coming months＃ Haven't we had enough of her?!",

    "text": "0 comments Obama was speaking to donors at a private fundraiser in California when he railed against former House Oversight Committee Chair Darrell Issa for calling his administration corrupt. \n※Here's a guy who called my administration perhaps the most corrupt in history 〞 despite the fact that actually we have not had a major scandal in my administration,§ Obama said! \nObama has had more scandals than any president in history! Just because the MSM refuses to report on them does not mean they do not exist! \nBreitbart reports : \nIssa was the key figure in several investigations of the Obama administration, including the Fast and Furious debacle with Attorney General Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton's failure in Benghazi, the failures in the Veterans Affairs department, and the IRS using its power to target conservative Tea Party groups for investigations. \nObama accused Issa of wasting taxpayer money ※on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere.§ \n※This guy has spent all his time simply trying to obstruct, to feed the same sentiments that resulted in Donald Trump becoming their nominee,§ Obama said. \nWe could list 77 scandals, but here are just 7 of the biggest! \n1.) IRS Targeting Scandal \nIn 2013, Lois Lerner, former director of the IRS Exempt Organizations division, admitted that officials in the IRS' Cincinnati office acted improperly. 2.) VA Waiting List \nThe Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general first noted the waiting list problem at a Phoenix clinic in 2014 and then found other clinics with similar problems. Veterans were placed on phony waiting lists, and some even died while waiting for care. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned from his position. 3.) GSA Spending Spree \nIn 2012, Martha N. Johnson, the administrator of the General Services Administration, resigned after the federal procurement agency was engulfed in a controversy. The department was accused of allowing excessive spending on travel and conferences for the agency and employees. 4.) Attack on the Benghazi Compound \nOn Sept. 11, 2012, weeks before a presidential election, terrorists attacked U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya. Obama administration officials initially blamed this attack on a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim YouTube video that spun out of control. 5.) Clinton Emails \nIt was the Benghazi committee that first discovered that before, during, and after her time as secretary of state, Clinton maintained a private email server. This prompted the FBI to investigate questions of whether Clinton violated the law in terms of storing classified information. 6.) Fast and Furious Gun Walking \nOperation Fast and Furious was a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives program, meant to be a sting operation. It allowed about 2,000 guns to flow to Mexican drug trafficking organizations under federal supervision before authorities lost control of the guns. 7.) Solyndra Subsidies \nThe Energy Department provided a $535 million loan guarantee to the politically connected solar panel firm Solyndra as part of the 2009 stimulus bill. Not long after building its factory, the California firm filed for bankruptcy protection and an FBI investigation ensued. The company did not find a buyer and eventually closed down. So Barack Obama＃just shut up!",

    "text": "0 comments Can this really be happening? Michelle Obama has been campaigning for Hillary Clinton for some time. She touts Hillary's accomplishments while denouncing Donald Trump as a misogynist and all-around scumbag. Just five days ago, the First Lady Of The United States and Hillary Clinton appeared together on stage in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. They held hands, they worked the crowd. Michelle presented a rousing statement: a??There are some folks out there who are commenting that it is unprecedented for a sitting first lady to be so actively engaged in a presidential campaign, and that may be true,a?? said Mrs. Obama, a reluctant campaigner who has nevertheless emerged in recent weeks as Mrs. Clintona??s most compelling surrogate. a??But what is also true is that this is truly an unprecedented election, and thata??s why Ia??m out here,a?? Mrs. Obama added, arguing that Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, was working to discourage people in the crowd from voting by making a??this election so dirty and ugly that we dona??t want any part of it.a?? What a difference a few days makes. Only a few moments ago, Michelle Obama made an earth shattering move on Twitter. Multiple outlets are reporting that Michelle deleted all references of Hillary from her Twitter feed, and all Tweets from the last three years. Yesterday @donnabrazile removed picture of Hilary from her profile. Today @FLOTUS and @MichelleObama removed all tweets mentioning Hillary. pic.twitter.com/e8Ebc53tlu \na?? DJ Weiner ???????? (@jeitoapp) November 1, 2016 \n5.5 million followers and no longer a mention of Hillary Clinton? \nAre Michelle Obama and the Democrats distancing themselves from the embattled Democrat nominee? \nIt sure looks like it. \nRemaining close to Hillary Clinton, with 650,000 insider emails reported to be exposed seems to be risky business. \nLet's not forget: WikiLeaks and Anonymous have not weighed in yet in they blockbuster ways that they have promised. \nOf course, it could be a technical error or coincidence. \nAfter all, Democrats are good at deleting things.",

Just when you start to think that there is nothing more Obama could say to become more a dirt bag than he's already proven himself to be, he goes and pulls something OFF THE CHARTS stupid! \nIn his efforts to push Hillary into the White House he spoke at a recent rally for her. What he had to say, was an insult to American men. \nSee for yourself! \nHe says he wants to be honest? He lacks the integrity to do so. So basically when men don't vote for Hillary, it's not because they are intelligent enough to recognize she is a corrupt snake whose greed and hunger for money and power will leave our country hanging by a string. It's not because they have a mind to think for themselves and decide whether she's the person for the job or not. \nNope＃according to Obama, it's because American men are racist. \nInfuriating..isn't it? \nIt's just too much stupid, and we all know we shouldn't engage with it because it will drag us down to its' level and destroy us with experience in stupidity＃but still. \nSometimes I wish we could mute the stupid. Just long enough to regain our sanity back to endure through it. \nWhat an idiot.",

Obama even went as far as to say that the KKK will return! \nPresident Barack Obama wants people in North Carolina to vote for Hillary Clinton, so he's warning them that Donald Trump would tolerate the support of the Klu Klux Klan if he's elected president. ※If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers 〞 the Klan 〞 and hesitate when asked about that support, then you'll tolerate that support when you're in office,§ he said. \nObama added that Trump would ※disrespect§ the Constitution as president, citing the Republican nominee's vow to put Hillary Clinton in jail. \n※[Y]ou threaten to throw your opponent in jail without any due process ＃ then imagine what you'll do when you actually have the power to violate the Constitution along those lines,§ Obama warned. \nObama made his remarks at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill on Wednesday, saying that the fate of the world rests on their shoulders. \n※I hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the Republic rests on your shoulders,§ he said as the audience laughed. ※The fate of the world is teetering, and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction.§ \nObama dismissed all of the negative ads and bad news that hurt Hillary Clinton as ※noise§ and ※distractions,§ that they should put aside. \n※Every day is just hysteria and over-the-top coverage,§ he said, admitting that even he was getting tired of politics. ※I understand the feeling, I promise you.§ \nHe argued that the choice for president was simple, because Trump was a con artist who was unfit and not ready to be president. \n※I mean, it's strange how, over time, what is crazy gets normalized,§ Obama said, referring to the multiple controversial statements made by Trump during the campaign. \n※That is not the voice of America. That's not the better angels of our nature,§ he said. \nIf you thought things couldn't get any more ridiculous, you're wrong.

This is what he had to say, as noted by The Washington Examiner: \n※Number one, as a human being, I like to see people 〞 it's inconceivable that, you know, people are sick, like you get sick, or I get sick, or the kids get sick, and you bring 'em to a doctor, inconceivable that, you know, 31 or 33 million people can't do that,§ Trump told host Joy Behar. ※So on one level, I think something had to be done.§ \nTrump continued, saying the law is ※really going to cost a lot of money in terms of competitiveness with this country§ and said it would cost a friend's company ※over $200 million a year.§ \nHere is what Trump recently tweeted: Obamacare is a disaster - as I've been saying from the beginning. Time to repeal & replace! #ObamacareFail pic.twitter.com/5CvoMbVceT 〞 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2016 \nDid Trump say it was a ※disaster from the beginning,§ or ※on one level, I think something had to be done§? \nPerhaps, we turn to another tweet he had, drawing on the popular hashtag #ObamaCareInThreeWords: REPEAL AND REPLACE!!! #ObamaCareInThreeWords 〞 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2016 \nIt turns out that Donald Trump is a fan of ※repeal and replace,§ but his political track record before he ran for president as a Republican shows that what he means by that is ※single-payer§〞the goal of the Obamacare architect all along. \nWhen it comes to Trump's solution for Obamacare〞making it more competitive for insurance companies〞this runs antithetical to the goal of single-payer, which is the government (i.e. taxpayers) paying for everyone. \nOne can draw their own conclusions about what Trump actually means right now, because no one can be one hundred percent sure. Yet for a man who styled himself as an outsider and not at all like a ※politician,§ his statements on Obamacare show himself very much to be similar to one.",

    "title": "When Obama Admin Went After Banks, It Forced Them to Give Big Money to Some...Questionable Groups",
    "text": "Share on Twitter \nA new study shows that after the Obama administration's Department of Justice (DOJ) collected billions in settlement money from U.S. banks after the mortgage collapse of 2008, it directed millions upon millions of dollars to several non-government organizations. \nPeter Schweitzer, author of the book ※Clinton Cash§ and founder of the Government Accountability Institute , told Fox News's Megyn Kelly that tens of millions of dollars from the record-breaking settlements in the bank deals were sent to these ' charitable' groups , some of whose jobs would be to get out the vote for... Democrats: \n※The banks are obviously eager to settle [and not go to trial]. [P]art of that settlement... will go to the victims of the crime you committed, but some of the money will go to pay restitution in the form of giving that money to non-profit organizations. These are non-profit organizations that are overwhelmingly progressive and serve as an adjunct to the Democratic party.§ \nOne group he mentioned on ※ The Kelly File § was fairly benign-sounding: \n※One organization that has received millions of dollars is in New York called the Asian Americans for Equality. Sounds like a great idea, right? The problem is, when you look into this organization which got money from banks via the Department of Justice, this is an organization affiliated with the Communist Workers Party. I didn't even know the Communist Workers Party was around anymore and, in fact, the organization that received this money is sympathetic to the North Korean regime.§ \nIndeed, the New York Times reports that many of the founders of Asian Americans for Equality (AAE) were active members of the Communist Workers Party, though AAE has since distanced itself from any modern-day ties. \nIn August, Andy Koenig of the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce wrote in The Wall Street Journal about the giveaways by the DOJ to friendly groups, or as he put it, ※a handout to the administration's allies§ [emphasis added]: \n\"Some groups on the list〞Catholic Charities, for instance〞are relatively nonpolitical. Others〞La Raza, the National Urban League, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition and more〞are anything but. \nMany of these groups engage in voter registration , community organizing and lobbying on liberal policy priorities at every level of government. They also provide grants to other liberal groups not eligible for payouts under the settlements. Thanks to the Obama administration, and the fungibility of money, the settlements' beneficiaries can now devote hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to these activities.\" \nJudicial Watch began an investigation in 2012, and here's what it said about how the Obama administration ladled out the vast amounts of money: \n※The Department of Justice (DOJ) will determine which 'qualified organizations' get leftover settlement cash and Democrat-tied groups like the scandal-plagued Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) and the open-borders National Council of La Raza (NCLR) stand to get large sums based on the hastily arranged deal which got court approval in just a few days.§ \nThe disgraced ACORN , the group that used protests to pressure banks into giving mortgages to people who couldn't qualify , was among those receiving Obama justice department funds. The group is now known under its new name, Mutual Housing Association of New York. \nThe DOJ also gave funds to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which carries the very name of the legislation signed into law by Bill Clinton 〞 The Community Reinvestment Act 〞 believed by many to be responsible for the implosion of the mortgage-lending industry. \nSome additional groups receiving the bank settlement money included: \nMinneapolis High Rise Representative Council [ACORN affiliate] \nLa Raza",

    "title": "Putin-Obama Trust Evaporates      : Information",
    "text": "Putin-Obama Trust Evaporates\nWhile the U.S. is investigating a potential covert Russian plan to throw a digital wrench in the 2016 election, one nominee has regularly praised their president Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama has expressed concern about cybersecurity to Putin amidst negotiations to curb common enemies in Syria. Sept. 9, 2016.\nRay McGovern\nOctober 31, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" Baltimore Sun \" - How did the \"growing trust\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his \"working and personal relationship with President Obama \" change into today?s deep distrust and saber-rattling?\nTheir relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the \"feverish\" state of international relations and lamented: \"My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.\" He complained about \"people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice\" and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a \"common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.\"\nA month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, \"My good friend John Kerry is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry?s] assurances that the US commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief.\"\nDo not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire ? not to mention statements at the time by the most senior US generals ? were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia.\nRelations between the US and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft ? including any stealth aircraft ? over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft.\nIt seems possible that the US air force will challenge that claim in due course ? perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, \"I wouldn?t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground.\"\nInjecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia?s warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a US or coalition aircraft.\nMeanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the US is contributing \"a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team\" as a \"major sign of the US commitment to strengthening deterrence here.\"\n\"This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,\" he explained, referring to NATO?s July summit meeting in the Polish capital. \"The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany.\"\nOn Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the \"myth\" of a \"Russian military threat,\" calling this a \"profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders.\"\nMyth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia?s borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against \"saber-rattling,\" adding that, \"We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation.\"\nSpeaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two and a half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d?谷tat in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia?s reaction in annexing Crimea. Americans malnourished on the diet served up by \"mainstream\" media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev, during which \"Yats\" (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington?s choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev.\nThis unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, \"really the most blatant coup in history.\"\nIt?s time for Western politicians and media to learn their lesson and pay attention to the statements coming out of Russia. Ask yourselves: Why all this hype now?\nRay McGovern, like Sam Adams, began a career as a CIA analyst under President Kennedy; working on Vietnam, they became close associates. Sam was too straight-arrow to go to the media about the unconscionable fraud regarding the number of Communist forces. Ray knew that and rationalized not doing so himself. So, while a close associate of Sam Adams years ago, Ray fell short of the standard set by the above awardees, who deserved to be honored by Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence.",

    "text": ". Mr Netanyahu has presented this as a rebuff to those who accuse him of jeopardising Israeli security interests with his government?s repeated affronts to the White House.\nIn the past weeks alone, defence minister Avigdor Lieberman has compared last year?s nuclear deal between Washington and Iran with the 1938 Munich pact, which bolstered Hitler; and Mr Netanyahu has implied that US opposition to settlement expansion is the same as support for the ?ethnic cleansing? of Jews.\nAmerican president Barack Obama, meanwhile, hopes to stifle his own critics who insinuate that he is anti-Israel. The deal should serve as a fillip too for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic party?s candidate to succeed Mr Obama in November?s election.\nIn reality, however, the Obama administration has quietly punished Mr Netanyahu for his misbehaviour. Israeli expectations of a $4.5bn-a-year deal were whittled down after Mr Netanyahu stalled negotiations last year as he sought to recruit Congress to his battle against the Iran deal.\nIn fact, Israel already receives roughly $3.8bn ? if Congress?s assistance on developing missile defence programmes is factored in. Notably, Israel has been forced to promise not to approach Congress for extra funds.\nThe deal takes into account neither inflation nor the dollar?s depreciation against the shekel.\nA bigger blow still is the White House?s demand to phase out a special exemption that allowed Israel to spend nearly 40 per cent of aid locally on weapon and fuel purchases. Israel will soon have to buy all its armaments from the US, ending what amounted to a subsidy to its own arms industry.\nNonetheless, Washington?s renewed military largesse ? in the face of almost continual insults ? inevitably fuels claims that the Israeli tail is wagging the US dog. Even The New York Times has described the aid package as ?too big?.\nSince the 1973 war, Israel has received at least $100bn in military aid, with more assistance hidden from view. Back in the 1970s, Washington paid half of Israel?s military budget. Today it still foots a fifth of the bill, despite Israel?s economic success.\nBut the US expects a return on its massive investment. As the late Israeli politician-general Ariel Sharon once observed, -Israel has been a US ?aircraft carrier? in the Middle East, acting as the regional bully and carrying out operations that benefit Washington.\nAlmost no one blames the US for Israeli attacks that wiped out Iraq?s and Syria?s nuclear programmes. A nuclear-armed Iraq or Syria would have deterred later US-backed moves at regime overthrow, as well as countering the strategic advantage Israel derives from its own nuclear arsenal.\nIn addition, Israel?s US-sponsored military prowess is a triple boon to the US weapons industry, the country?s most powerful lobby. Public funds are siphoned off to let Israel buy goodies from American arms makers. That, in turn, serves as a shop window for other customers and spurs an endless and lucrative game of catch-up in the rest of the Middle East.\nThe first F-35 fighter jets to arrive in Israel in December ? their various components produced in 46 US states ? will increase the clamour for the cutting-edge warplane.\nIsrael is also a ?front-line laboratory?, as former Israeli army negotiator Eival Gilady admitted at the weekend, that develops and field-tests new technology Washington can later use itself.\nThe US is planning to buy back the missile interception system Iron Dome ? which neutralises battlefield threats of retaliation ? it largely paid for. Israel works closely too with the US in developing cyber-warfare, such as the Stuxnet worm that damaged Iran?s civilian nuclear programme.\nBut the clearest message from Israel?s new aid package is one delivered to the Palestinians: Washington sees no pressing strategic interest in ending the occupation. It stood up to Mr Netanyahu over the Iran deal but will not risk a damaging clash over Palestinian statehood.\nSome believe that Mr Obama signed the aid package to win the credibility necessary to overcome his domestic Israel lobby and pull a rabbit from the hat: an initiative, unveiled shortly before he leaves office, that corners Mr Netanyahu into making peace.\nHopes have been raised by an expected meeting at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday. But their first talks in 10 months are planned only to demonstrate unity to confound critics of the aid deal.\nIf Mr Obama really wanted to pressure Mr Netanyahu, he would have used the aid agreement as leverage. Now Mr Netanyahu need not fear US financial retaliation, even as he intensifies effective annexation of the West Bank.\nMr Netanyahu has drawn the right lesson from the aid deal ? he can act against the Palestinians with continuing US impunity.\n- See more at: http://www.jonathan-cook.net/2016-09-19/palestinians-lose-in-us-military-aid-deal-with-israel/#sthash.fL4Eq28N.dpuf Obama Loses It: Goes Off On Audience Video\n?Listen Up ?

    "text": "Obama Admin Targets Soldiers' Bonuses, Lets Bad VA Employees Keep Theirs Pentagon asks troops to repay bonuses, VA rewards employees after widespread problems Morgan Chalfant | Free Beacon - October 26, 2016 Comments \nThe federal government is trying to recoup enlistment bonuses given erroneously to thousands of California soldiers despite routinely allowing poor-performing VA employees to keep their bonus checks. \nThe Los Angeles Times reported last week that the Pentagon demanded that thousands of California soldiers repay bonuses they were given to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department asked the soldiers to repay the bonuses, which amounted to $15,000 or more each, after audits revealed they were overpaid by the California National Guard. \nBut the practice stands in contrast with that of the Obama administration's Department of Veterans Affairs, which has failed to take back hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to high-ranking bureaucrats who have been scrutinized for bad behavior or poor management. \nFor instance, the VA said last year it would not collect over $400,000 in bonuses paid to two senior executives who manipulated the agency's hiring system to take new jobs with less responsibility and receive relocation benefits. The VA, which acknowledged that the employees abused the system, said it did not have the legal authority to recoup the money.",

Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree.

ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,§ points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldn't come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people.

    "text": "VIDEOS Will Barack Obama delay or suspend the election if Hillary is forced out by the new FBI email investigation? An A.I. system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of #Hillary By Michael Snyder - November 3, 2016 \nJust when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails ※did not come from her private server§, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the ※emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry§, and according to some reports there may be ※potentially thousands§ of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? \nLet's take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN ＃ After recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ※appear to be pertinent§ to the email probe. ※In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,§ Comey wrote the chairmen. ※I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.§ \nAt this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton's closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton's Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered ＃ We don't know what this means yet except that it's a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that's where we are＃ Is it a certainty that we won't learn before the election? I'm not sure it's a certainty we won't learn before the election. One thing is, it's possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her＃ \nIf the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? \nIt is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. \nSo those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. \nBut if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason＃ If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year's primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members 每 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group's bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nIt would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. \nIn such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be ※fair§ until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. \nMeanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. \nAnd CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November＃ An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. \nWithout Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. \nSo if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. \nAt this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.",

    "text": "Mainstream media in shock after a solid Trump victory; Clinton concedes; will Obama go quietly into the night? Liberals infuriated; people chanting \"lock her up, lock her up [...]\" By Shepard Ambellas - November 9, 2016 ( INTELLIHUB ) 〞 Early Wednesday morning Donald J. Trump accepted the Presidency of the United States like a true gentlemen, even thanking Hillary Clinton for her long-winded service to the country. \n※Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. [＃] It is time for us to come together as one united people.,§ Trump said. \nTrump also reached out to those who chose not to support him in the past for their ※guidance and help§ to make America great again. \n※It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will.§ \n[＃] \n※Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country,§ Trump said. \n※We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again.§ \nAt a victory party Trump supporters could be heard chanting ※lock her up, lock her up [＃],§ Tom Llamas told ABC News, pointing out that Hillary Clinton's problems may not be over just yet. Not to mention how such rhetoric infuriated liberals nationwide. Chants of ※LOCK HER UP!§ at Trump party raise the necessary Q: Will Trump appoint a special prosecutor to take on Clinton, as promised? \n〞 McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) November 9, 2016 \nAs the night went on most mainstream figureheads and pundits went into panic mode as the results started to flip, showing overwhelming favor of Trump. They just couldn't figure out how or why Mr. Trump won. It's as if they actually believed their masters fake polls that they were airing the entire race. \nLet me also mention that in many documented cases, people who voted ＆all Republican' across the board had issues at the polls with the machines actually switching their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. Interestingly enough, despite the fact that a number of Soros deployed voting machines were likely rigged, Trump still won with some lead. \n〞 TheAngryOne (@The_AngryGuy) November 8, 2016 \nIt makes you wonder what the actual numbers were. In fact they probably were consistent with many Intellihub polls which have shown Trump vs. Clinton at an 60/40 to and 80/20 split, like the following poll taken on Election Day which shows Trump at 62% over Hillary's 33. \nWe are in the midnight hour #ElectionDay , who will win \n〞 Shepard Ambellas (@ShepardAmbellas) November 8, 2016 \nIt was also noted by an analyst friend of mine that the Hillary campaign likely was devastated by what they thought was going to be a guaranteed victory and that we will likely see some corrupt politicians flee Washington D.C., like ＆rats in the streets.' \nThen we have to contend with the fact that Trump does not take office until Jan. 20, 2017, which may give the rats in D.C. enough time to conduct a counter strike on the Trump campaign. Will Obama go quietly into the night? \nThe short and simple answer is: no, he will not. At minimum we can expect more executive orders and the pardoning of connected individuals on his way out. Not to mention that Obama likely has a trick up his sleeve. \nThere is always a ＆Plan B,' which is essentially orchestrated chaos which would allow Obama to then suspend Trump's inauguration. In fact, all that Obama needs to make it happen, legally, through executive order, would be for a crisis of some type to occur in between now and the inauguration 〞 it's that simple. \nEven an ＆act of God,' such as a ＆ devastating space weather event ＆ could trigger such action and may. \nWe can also expect pockets of unrest, especially in major cities. \nThe bottom line is: the elites do not want to loose their power and are not going to wait another four years to regain it. \n#RemainVigilant \n#MAGA Shepard Ambellas is an opinion journalist, filmmaker , radio talk show host and the founder and editor-in-chief of Intellihub News & Politics.

( INTELLIHUB ) 〞 The Establishment elite are in panic mode after their rigged elections backfired in their face when vast seas of patriotic Americans took to the polls in favor of Donald J. Trump, giving America's new President-elect the electoral votes needed to win. \nLast Thursday, during a meeting held at the White House, between Donald Trump and President Barack Obama, you could just see how irked Obama was knowing that he was sitting beside a truly patriotic soul; a man with a raging fire burning inside him; a man with the spirit to facilitate making America great again. Not to mention Trump was the man that brought Obama's birth certificate issue to the forefront. The look on @POTUS face when he met @realDonaldTrump #priceless \n〞 Shepard Ambellas (@ShepardAmbellas) November 12, 2016 \nIn fact, during the meeting Obama was so threatened by Trump's presence that his 8-year-long legacy likely flashed before his very eyes as the President of the United States realized that on day number one of Donald Trump's presidency, a president Trump, at that point, could simply nullify any and all executive orders signed by the then would-be former president Barack Obama during his tenure as POTUS . What will happen if Trump nullifies all of Obama's executive orders once POTUS? Ted Eytan/Flickr Does this mean no more ＆transgender bathrooms?' \nAbsolutely. Imagine that; a normal world, how it always was for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Naval History & Heritage Command/Flickr Does that mean Americans can keep their guns? \nSure does. America would not be America if we did not have the right to bear arms and work to undo what anti-gunners have done in Washington D.C. over the past two decades and what Obama has done over the past 8-years against the U.S. Constitution . Fibonacci Blue/Flickr Does that mean the repeal of Obamacare or major failed portions of it? \nYes it does. Does that mean the preservation of our civil rights and liberties per the Constitution? \nSure does. Does that mean implementing a sensible immigration policy; possibly building a wall? \nYes it does. After all, the Russians are now using advanced killer robots at their border, ones that can engage and kill humans from over 6 miles away. Nancy <I'm gonna SNAP!/Flickr Does that mean putting an end to dangerous geoengineering programs that our affecting all living things on the planet and our weather? \nOne can only hope. \nBut you can see where I am going with this. The Establishment elite simply do not want to lose their power and in my opinion will likely do anything to keep it. Remember, they have built a legacy and plan to protect it at all costs. \nSo in other words; will Donald Trump actually take office against all odds? \nPlease comment below and share your opinion on this highly important issue. \nShepard Ambellas is an opinion journalist, filmmaker , radio talk show host and the founder and editor-in-chief of Intellihub News & Politics.

    "text": "VIDEOS President Obama leaves behind a deplorable civil liberties legacy An article published yesterday highlighted some of the extremely illiberal policies perpetrated by so-called ※liberal§ champion, Barack Obama By Michael Krieger - Tuesday, November 15, 2016 8:48 AM EST \nMore disappointing than the Obama administration itself (which was very disappointing), were the seemingly endless hordes of fake liberals constantly justifying and making excuses for his well documented litany of civil liberties abuses. Naturally, I likewise expect countless Trump supporters to instinctively make similar excuses for Trump if he should end up naming former Goldman Sachs Partner, and overall finance miscreant , Steve Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary. This is a huge part of our problem as a nation. Rather than having well defined principles and defending them, we tend to pick personalities we like and then cheer them on as uncritically as our favorite sports teams. \nMoving along, a New York Times article published yesterday highlighted some of the extremely illiberal policies perpetrated by so-called ※liberal§ champion, Barack Obama. \nHere are a few key excerpts: Over and over, Mr. Obama has imposed limits on his use of such powers but has not closed the door on them 〞 a flexible approach premised on the idea that he and his successors could be trusted to use them prudently. Mr. Trump can now sweep away those limits and open the throttle on policies that Mr. Obama endorsed as lawful and legitimate for sparing use, like targeted killings in drone strikes and the use of indefinite detention and military tribunals for terrorism suspects. And even in areas where Mr. Obama tried to terminate policies from the George W. Bush era 〞 like torture and the detention of Americans and other people arrested on domestic soil as ※enemy combatants§ 〞 his administration fought in court to prevent any ruling that the defunct practices had been illegal. The absence of a definitive repudiation could make it easier for Trump administration lawyers to revive the policies by invoking the same sweeping theories of executive power that were the basis for them in the Bush years. Two decisions by Mr. Obama in 2009 set the tone for his leave-it-on-the-table approach. They involved whether to keep indefinite wartime detentions without trial and to continue using military commission prosecutions 〞 if not at the Guant芍namo prison, which he had resolved to close, then at a replacement wartime prison. Told that several dozen detainees could not be tried for any crime but would be particularly risky to release, and that a handful might be prosecutable only under the looser rules governing evidence in a military commission, Mr. Obama decided that the responsible policy was to keep both the tribunals and the indefinite detentions available. The president refused to use either power on newly captured terrorism suspects, instead prosecuting them in civilian court. But by leaving the options open, he helped normalize them and left them on a firmer legal basis . Mr. Obama followed a similar course with several national security practices that became controversial during his first term. After his use of drones to kill terrorism suspects away from war zones led to mounting concerns over civilian casualties and other matters, he issued a ※ presidential policy guidance § in May 2013 that set stricter limits. They included a requirement that the target pose a threat to Americans 〞 not just to American interests 〞 and that there would be near certainty of no bystander deaths. But the Obama administration also successfully fought in court to establish that judges would not review the legality of such killing operations, even if an American citizen was the target. Mr. Trump 〞 who has said he would ※bomb the hell out of ISIS,§ beyond what Mr. Obama is doing, and go after civilian relatives of terrorists, prevailing over any military commanders who balked 〞 could scrap the internal limits while invoking those precedents to shield his acts from judicial review. Similarly, after a surge of criminal prosecutions against people who leaked secret information to the news media and bipartisan outrage at aggressive investigative tactics targeting journalists, the Obama Justice Department issued new guidelines for leak investigations intended to make it harder for investigators to subpoena reporters' testimony or phone records. It also decided not to force a reporter for The New York Times to testify in a leak trial or face prison for contempt. But the Obama administration also successfully fought in court to establish that the First Amendment offers no protection to journalists whom the executive branch chooses to subpoena to testify against confidential sources. Mr. Trump, who has proposed changing libel laws to make it easier to sue news organizations, could abandon the Obama-era internal restraints and invoke the Obama-era court precedent to adopt more aggressive policies in leak investigations. Well done Obama.",

    "text": "VIDEOS Obama, Clinton, and Sanders could stop the riots but they just watch If Obama, Clinton, and Sanders really loved America, these three would use their influence to ease the transition By Daisy Luther - Friday, November 18, 2016 1:21 PM EST \nIs it just me or have you also noticed that Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and President Obama have been silent about the protests? \nThe very people who have the power to stop these protests and riots with just a few well-spoken words have been completely silent on the issue. Hillary Clinton \nDuring her concession speech , Clinton said, ※We must accept this result, and then look to the future. ＃ Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.§ \nAfter that, she has been mum on the entire thing. \nHillary Clinton could have asked her followers to stop this nonsense, and they probably would have listened out of respect for her. (Misplaced respect but that's a whole different article.) Instead, her silence makes me think that she is hidden away, relishing the chaos. That she has done nothing to attempt to calm the situation underlines the fact that she was not fit to govern. A leader would look out for the best interests of a country they love, rather than watching from afar to apply balm to her wounded ego. \nInstead, her Twitter is full of Bible quotes (huh?) and mentions nary a word about the protests. It has not been updated since the day after her failed bid. Bernie Sanders \nBernie Sanders, the one from whom the Democratic primary was fraudulently stolen, the one who backed up Hillary Clinton anyway, has also been uncharacteristically silent, especially for an aging peace-and-love hippie kind of guy. \nHe hasn't once asked the protesters to be peaceful or to give Trump a chance, but he has fueled the fire with his cries for them to remain vigilant. He's already opposing Trump before the guy even gets inaugurated. \nEven in his essay for the NY Times yesterday, entitled ※ Where Do Democrats Go From Here? § he did not gently suggest to his supporters that they turn toward peace. He had the opportunity, the platform, and the love from his followers, and his choice to remain silent tells me that he is just as self-serving as the other politicians, despite his humble, grandfatherly demeanor. President Obama \nThen there's the President, who met cordially with Trump . His Twitter account is likewise mute on the subject of vandalism, arson, and violence in reaction to the election. \nNote to President Obama: I didn't like it when you were elected either, but I burned neither flags nor effigies. I peacefully dissented throughout your administration but never damaged one single item of property. You screwed the middle class with your horrible health care catastrophe, and yet no one rioted in the streets when you were re-elected to screw us for another four years. \nObama's only statement of semi-support was on Wednesday, when he said, ※※The peaceful transfer of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. We're actually all on the same team.§ \nHis statement about the riots was via his press secretary . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, asked Thursday about the protests, said the president believes the right to free speech should be protected. He added, ※It is a right that should be exercised without violence. And there are people who are disappointed in the outcome. And the president's message in the Rose Garden was it's not surprising that people are disappointed in the outcome, but it's important for us to remember, a day or two after the election, that we're Democrats and Republicans, but we're Americans and patriots first.§ This won't end well. \nKellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, sees it the same way. She has called on Obama and Clinton to address the violence, but thus far, her request seems to have fallen on willfully deaf ears. Not cool. @POTUS or Hillary should address. ＆People Have to Die': Anti-Trump Protester Calls For Violence on CNN https://t.co/NfEqhkrTvu \n〞 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 10, 2016 \nNot accepting the result and keeping up the protests will lead to nowhere except more trouble as the contagion of anger spreads. It is only a matter of time before it really gets out of hand and people start dying. \nSince protesters are now actually calling for war and death, if Obama, Clinton, and Sanders really loved America, these three would use their influence to ease the transition and call for peace. Instead, one must wonder if the rumors about a Soros-funded, Clinton-approved Purple Revolution to destabilize America are about to become our new reality. \nOh 每 and one quick note. It has to be said \nThe people calling for war and death are overwhelmingly anti-gun. \nThey just might want to rethink the wisdom of directing their death threats, physical attacks, and aggression toward Second Amendment proponents.

    "text": "Murder Inc. in the White House; Obama's Drones for Breakfast Club By Thomas C. Mountain   Thomas C. Mountain \nElections come and go but when ※The Don,§ Barack Obama, meets with his inner circle of Capos every Tuesday morning its breakfast with drones as in the Murder Incorporated assassination program. \nThink about it, every Tuesday morning in the White House this breakfast club decides who they are going to blow to smithereens that week, with fresh fruit and cappuccinos all around. \nDoes Obama lie in bed on Monday nights deciding who to have assasinated the next day? You think I am joking? I went to the same school as Barack Obama, I know it torments the brother to blow away all those women and children at those village weddings but someone has to protect Pax Americana . . . right? \nHear it straight from the mouth of Barack in 2012. ※Turns out I'm really good at killing people. Didn't know that was a strong suit of mine.§ . \nThe criminal absurdity of the right to kill at will without consequence when you head the most powerful military on the planet as the commander in chief seems to be completely lost on the American sheeple. \nAs a star basketball player in high school Barry O'Bomber, as he was known, left a life of being the only black kid in an elite school of 3,000 to being amongst black Americans for the first time in his life when he left Hawaii for college on ※the continent,§ as it is known in the islands. \nObama spent most of his childhood completely isolated from blacks, had reached early adulthood before having any black friends and then made his career out of being black. Could this explain his sociopathic behavior? \nI suspect ※Barry,§ as his white grandmother renamed him, must know about Murder Inc., the national crime syndicate headed by Lucky Luciano in the 1930s who met regularly to decide whom to kill. \nMr. Luciano ended up serving life in a federal prison only to be released to set up the Italian Mafia nationally after WW2 as a part of the CIA's forerunners plan for murder and mayhem against the Italian Communist Party to prevent them from winning the postwar Italian elections. \nImpunity to kill, it runs in American history and Barack Obama finds himself surprisingly good at it. Breakfast with drones, approving the hit list alongside expressos and bagels, Tuesday morning is still Murder Inc. in the Obama White House. \nThomas C.

Even the nefarious George Soros asserted confidently that Trump might win the popular election but Hillary would win the Electoral College. \nBut apparently the voters just weren't ready for a tyrannical President yet. The perception of the two candidates shaped by the mainstream media led the unsuspecting 每 if not comatose 每 public to believe that Hillary Clinton was some liberal angel who would save the country from reality and that Trump is some kind of fascist monster who is going to force everyone with slightly tinted skin to leave the country. \nOf course, nothing could be farther from the truth. Lost in the shuffle is the fact that the Dragon Lady, reincarnated, hid behind the veil of the tax-free status of the Clinton Foundation to steal $100's of millions from the taxpayers and the Saudi royal family (the Huma Abedin connection, which is why she is Hillary's ※Igor§) and move it into the bank accounts of the Clinton family and friends of the Clinton family. The taxpayers got nothing in return 每 the Saudi family got use of the U.S. military to attack Syria. \nPhony polls are just another form of insidious propaganda 每 it's a tool designed to persuade the masses to go the direction of the poll and discourage the other side from voting. It worked for Hitlery and the DNC against Bernie in California. But the people woke up enough to see through the ruse in the big election. \nThe election results on Tuesday were not about giving Trump or the Republican Party a political and economic policy mandate. The only mandate issued on Tuesday 每 quite loud and clear 每 was this: ※Someone please stop Washington DC and Wall Street from date-raping us in the bodily area where waste exits.§ That was it. Obama had the same mandate in 2008 and completely betrayed his supporters. \nJudging from the early indications from the Trump camp regarding Trump's likely cabinet and advisor appointments, it's going to be out with the old and in with the old. Currently it appears as if the new Attorney General will be Rudy Guiliani, who is a blatant Establishment hack; Larry Kudlow as an advisor, who is the worst economist in modern era; and Jamie Dimon, CEO, JP Morgan/Chase 每 who should be in jail 每 and Goldman Sachs alumnus Steven Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary. More of the same. Neocon elitists, Establishment apologists and Wall Street thieves. \nThe Shadow of Truth hosted special guest, Eric Dubin of The News Doctors to review and dissect what happened on Tuesday evening.

These planes were put on display last week when Iran launched a series of war drills aimed at deterring Western attacks. \nAs Iran angles to purchase 80 new jets from Boeing, which has lobbied heavily in favor of these sales, the Obama administration is being accused of helping to pave the way for Iran to transfer these commercial liners for use in its war fleet, according to lawmakers and sources familiar with Iran's military buildup. \nIran has a history of transferring commercial jets purchased from America to its air force for use in military operations and the transfer of weapons and other illicit material abroad. \nLawmakers worry that the White House's efforts to facilitate new airliner sales to Iran Air, the country's national airline, will help Tehran bolster its war fleet at a time when it is threatening military action \nFOR ENTIRE ARTICLE CLICK LINK",

    "text": "SHOCK: White House Won't Comment on Obama ※Plan§ to Leave Country if Trump Elected Oct 29, 2016 Previous post \nA number of Americans have promised to leave the United States if GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump wins the November election. \nWhile President Barack Obama has himself never issued such a pledge, the way his White House press secretary responded Monday to a question about his post-election plans suggested that perhaps he intended to leave as well. \nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest took a direct question from a reporter about whether or not Obama himself would leave the county if Trump wins in November 〞 but he gave anything but a direct answer. \n※He's working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn't support,§ press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday during a news briefing on Air Force One, as reported by Politico . \nBy no means was that statement an admission of anything; it was, however, a clear dodge. The question was whether or not Obama intended to leave were Trump elected president. Instead of offering a direct answer, Earnest seemingly justified the fears felt by anyone who did plan to leave. \nIs the president himself among those paranoid Americans riddled with fear over the GOP candidate's potential presidency? This line of thinking might sound conspiratorial, but what the president himself said later that evening on ※Jimmy Kimmel Live!§ only bolstered this perception. \n※There's something different about the way Trump has operated in the political sphere,§ Obama said, according to the Washington Examiner . ※I ran against McCain, against Romney.

According to a series of sources, a newspaper in Kuwait, a news service in ※Bethlehem§ and the ever faithful Israel National news, it is all true. Israel's slated 2014 nuclear attack on Iran, to be launched from Azerbaijan using nuclear weapons landed at Poti, Georgia in 2010, was averted due to threats of US reprisals against Israel.

    "text": "WikiLeaks Report: Obama Admin Discriminated Against Christians for Top Jobs In Favor of Muslims Oct 29, 2016 Previous post \nIn a bombshell email from September 2008 , advisers to Barack Obama's presidential campaign consciously decided to choose Arab Muslims over Arab Christians in suggesting top staff positions should Obama win the White House. The email was released by WikiLeaks in its latest series, ※The Podesta Emails.§ \nFormer New York Solicitor General Preeta D. Bansal sent the email to Michael Froman, a classmate of Obama's at Harvard and a member of the 12-person advisory board for the Obama campaign's transition team. The email came with ※the compiled lists of Asian American and Muslim American candidates for top Administration jobs, sub-cabinet jobs, and outside boards/agencies/policy committees.§ \nThe key reveal comes in this passage: \nIn the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (of outside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be Muslim American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of uncertain religion (esp. Christian). \nThis suggests the Obama campaign's transition team aimed to hire Muslims over Christians, or at the very least that in the interests of diversity, the team was willing to give preferential treatment to Muslim Arabs rather than Christian Arabs. The emphasis on adherence to Islam is significant, given other troubling aspects of the Obama administration. \nOf the Syrian refugees admitted to the United States in September 2016, 98.9 percent were Muslim (1825 refugees), as compared to only 1.1 percent non-Muslim (22 refugees). Over the whole year, non-Muslim Syrian refugee admissions account for less than one percent (0.8) overall, with 11,818 Muslims and only 95 non-Muslims. \nAccording to The Gulf/2000 Project at Columbia University, the religious breakdown of the Syrian population from 2008-2009 shows that non-Muslims made up a great deal more \nFOR ENTIRE ARTICLE CLICK LINK",

    "text": "Region: USA in the World Even though The American Spectator has claimed that ※Obama and his crew will soon be swept into the dustbin of history§, the future of ※America's lame duck§ still draws a lot of media attention. Some commentators, especially those that have been handsomely paid by the White House, are trying to somehow improve the public image of the still sitting US president who has discredited himself in a number of ways over the last 8 years, especially in such fields as ※ combating § racism in the United States and Washington's military interventions across the globe. The New York Times would note that with less than three months left for his presidency, Barack Obama is preparing for a life after the White House that would most likely include a close relationship with Silicon Valley. As an explanation for such a statement, the newspaper provides the report on how interested President Obama was in the Dragon spacecraft built by SpaceX. President Obama even tested a program that stimulates docking the spacecraft with the International Space Station. This area of Obama's possible interests is cited by a great many commentators as his future occupation, which seems logical since Obama's ※contribution§ to US military contractors regarding profits has been paramount all throughout his years in office. However, there's reports that Obama has diverse musical interests as well. Reportedly, his favorite music genre is soul. He listens to various artists that developed this genre, but his absolute favorite is Stevie Wonder and his ※My Cherie Amour§, ※All In Love Is Fair§, ※For Once in My Life§, and ※I Just Called to Say I Love You§. These songs can always be found in the playlist of the current American leader. Barack Obama is also found of Al Green and his vocal prowess. He tends to enjoy such saxophonists as Lester Young, John Coltrane, and Coleman Hawkins. As for rock legends, Obama prefers to listen to the legendary The Rolling Stones and The Beatles. As for the latest hits, Barack Obama has been enjoying the Canadian indie rockers Arcade Fire with their ※We Used to Wait§, and the British indie-pop band Florence & The Machine with their hit ※You've Got The Love§. As a real American president, Barack Obama just can not help but love country music as well, as he frequently listens to such bands as Zac Brown and Montgomery Gentry. So some musicians, especially in the US, have been advising Obama to switch to musical activities, perhaps playing in a banjo in a band. 每 It seems that it might be a good pastime for Obama after his ※toying with soldiers§ in the Middle East and other regions of the world. A lot of comments in various media can be found about Obama's ties with hospitals, and Doctors Without Borders in particular. Tens of hospital have been wiped off the face of the earth and hundreds of doctors and their patients died as a result of the strikes in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and elsewhere in the world authorized by Obama. Therefore, it seems unlikely that any hospital run by Doctors Without Borders will have the courage to turn Obama's application down after the termination of his presidential mandate. Especially when you consider that the risk of dying under US bombs will diminish for most of its employees after January 2017. However, if the White House is then occupied by Hillary Clinton, Obama may be running the risk of coming under friendly fire if working in one of such hospitals, an irony considering his endorsement of Clinton. But the most important thing by far is that Obama will no longer be making America's decisions, since during his time doing so, he has got the US mired in five overseas wars simultaneously , subjecting millions of innocent civilians in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia to intolerable suffering, loss of shelter and families, and forced refuge in foreign lands. Therefore, the choice of a decent successor to the current lame duck president should be way more important than supporting the war party and Obama's spiritual successor 每 Hillary Clinton.

    "title": "Is Obama Staging a Color Revolution in the US | New Eastern Outlook",
    "text": "Region: USA in the World The recent victory of now President-elect Donald Trump has taken a lot of Americans by surprise. But it would be safe to say that the corporate ruling elites that went all in on Hillary Clinton were literally shocked by her defeat. Without her at the head of the state they fear they may not be able to carry on spreading the corruption, which is believed to be at the foundation of the Clinton clan, or carry on waging wars upon other states which includes arming terrorists responsible for killing thousands of civilians around the world. And even though the corporate elites have formally acknowledged Trump's victory, they are pressuring the current government to fight the next US President tooth and nail, until all resources are exhausted. Over the last eight years, the Obama administration has acquired a long list of tricks that were used against undesired governments in various parts of the world, while the most effective among them is the so-called ※color revolutions,§ where essentially a coup d'etat is achieved by media manipulation and large mobs. US intelligence services are now prepared to unleash such a revolution on the home front, since they are fairly concerned about their future under Trump, as the Washington Post would report. The fact that Obama still believes in Trump's inability to replace him in the White House has already been announced by the White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. At the same time, he would point out, while commenting on the anti-Trump protests in the US, that the right for freedom of expression must be exercised without violence, clearly alluding to the current administration's arsenal of ※peaceful§ tools that would allow it to get rid of Trump. That is why we already are witnessing a wave of ※protests§ being unleashed under the control of the Obama administration. The corporate media and social networks are openly arrayed against the incoming 45th US President. These very tactics have been used by US intelligence agencies in Brazil, Nicaragua, Hong Kong, Thailand, as well as across the Middle East and Eastern Europe to unleash a ※color revolution§. In some countries, such actions have brought foreign government under the direct control of the White House, as we can see it in Ukraine, Brazil and several other countries. As a result, we are now being told about thousands of protesters in US cities rallying against the Trump election victory. These claims were followed by a petition published on Change.org that demands the US authorities change the results of the recent election, demanding the electoral college be revised, and that the election results be overturned on December 19. It is being reported that this petition has already been signed by a total of two million people . It goes without saying that an attempt to launch a ※color revolution§ in the United States is being supported by a number of Europe states in addition to the US, including France and Germany, since the political order there is concerned about the impunity they've been enjoying coming to an end, with Trump failing to openly signal continued open US support for them.. The British Independent wants Trump to be impeached, citing law professor Christopher Peterson, who would claim that there is a strong case for the beginning of legal proceedings that would stop Donald Trump from being president. The impeachment process is usually initiated when a president of a state has committed some sort of a serious offense, but Trump hasn't been able to do anything yet, since he hasn't been inaugurated. Still the Independent believes there must be some legal ground for his impeachment. It's clear the train of ※color revolution§ is under full steam in the US today. What will come up from this attempt to ignore the US Constitution, remains to be seen.

    "title": "Former US Intelligence Chief Admits Obama Took ※Willful Decision§ to Support ISIS Rise",
    "text": "Region: USA in the World If one was only to read mainstream news in the West, you would probably be inculcated with the myth that Islamic State (ISIS) appeared almost out of thin air and many governments in the Western world have been completely shocked by the rise of this terror group. Perhaps you would correctly blame the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq as a major reason why such extreme groups gained power in the region, in addition to blaming certain governments for supposedly marginalizing Sunni's. But what most mainstream readers will be miserably ignorant of is the fact that one of the main opposition groups fighting the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria has been ISIS itself, a group that has been trained, funded, aided and armed by NATO countries in collusion with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Israel (to name a few). This reality has been completely omitted in numerous corporate media publications, once again demonstrating the inept and deceptive nature of mainstream news. Some Western news outlets are still peddling the fallacy that the Obama administration misjudged the threat of ISIS, and was taken by surprise by the groups rise. Obama himself claimed in 2014 when responding to a question asking whether the US underestimated ISIS: ※That their advance, their movement, over the last several months has been more rapid than the intelligence estimates and I think the expectations of policy makers both inside and outside of Iraq.§ This narrative runs in stark contrast to a recently declassified US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) document from 2012 which was released by Judicial Watch after the watchdog group filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit. The DIA document warned: ※ISI [the Islamic State of Iraq] could also declare an Islamic State through its union with other terrorist organisations in Iraq and Syria.§ ( p.5 ) In a recent interview with Mehdi Hasan of Al Jazeera, the former head of the DIA, Michael T. Flynn, reiterates that the Obama administration was warned about the potential of extreme groups gaining influence in the region but instead of halting the support for the Syrian opposition, the administration took the ※wilful decision§ to support the rebels anyway: Hasan (Interviewer) (From 11.15 onwards into the interview): ※In 2012, your agency was saying, quote: ※The Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood and Al-Qaeda in Iraq [(which ISIS arose out of)], are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria.§ In 2012, the US was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups. Why did you not stop that if you're worried about the rise of Islamic extremism?§ Flynn : ※Well I hate to say it's not my job, but＃ my job was to ensure that the accuracy of our intelligence that was being presented was as good as it could be, and I will tell you, it goes before 2012. When we were in Iraq, and we still had decisions to be made before there was a decision to pull out of Iraq in 2011, it was very clear what we were going to face.§ Hasan (Interviewer): You are basically saying that even in government at the time, you knew those groups were around, you saw this analysis, and you were arguing against it, but who wasn't listening?§ Flynn : ※I think the administration.§ Hasan (Interviewer): ※So the administration turned a blind eye to your analysis?§ Flynn : ※I don't know if they turned a blind eye. I think it was a decision, a willful decision.§ Hasan (Interviewer): ※A wilful decision to support an insurgency that had Salafists, Al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood?§ Flynn: ※A wilful decision to do what they're doing＃ You have to really ask the President what is it that he actually is doing with the policy that is in place, because it is very, very confusing.§ It is quite obvious that NATO countries in conjunction with regional allies have been funding, arming and training an array of rebel bandits to overthrow the secular Syrian government for years now, although they have been unable to force regime change in Damascus so far. In the 2012 declassified report from the DIA, the document reveals that the powers supporting the Syrian opposition 每 ※Western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey§ 每 wanted to create a ※Salafist principality in Eastern Syria in order to isolate the Syrian regime§: ※Opposition forces are trying to control the Eastern areas (Hasaka and Der Zor), adjacent to the Western Iraqi provinces (Mosul and Anbar), in addition to neighbouring Turkish borders. Western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey are supporting these efforts＃ If the situation unravels there is the possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared Salafist principality in Eastern Syria (Hasaka and Der Zor), and this is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition want, in order to isolate the Syrian regime, which is considered the strategic depth of the Shia expansion (Iraq and Iran).§ ( p.5 ) Shipping Weapons from Libya to the Syrian Rebels Numerous reports in 2012 alleged that the US was sending heavy weapons from the military stockpiles of the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, to the Syrian rebels. Another formerly classified document released by Judicial Watch from the US Department of Defense (DOD) reveals that the White House was at least aware of arms shipments from Libya to Syria, although the document does not disclose who was shipping the weapons: ※Weapons from the former Libya military stockpiles were shipped from the port of Benghazi, Libya to the Port of Banias and the Port of Borj Islam, Syria. The weapons shipped during late-August 2012 were Sniper rifles, RPG's, and 125 mm and 155mm howitzers missiles＃ The numbers for each weapon were estimated to be: 500 Sniper rifles, 100 RPG launchers with 300 total rounds, and approximately 400 howitzers missiles [200 ea 每 125mm and 200ea 每 155 mm.]§ ( DOD Document ) This is all part of a long term strategy by the West to overthrow regimes that are not subservient to Western interests. NATO's 2011 war in Libya has already forced regime change in the North African country, with the West still working on bringing down the Syrian regime. Both countries were listed as enemies of the US by the neoconservative thinktank, the Project for a New American Century (PNAC) in their 2000 report, long before the illegal 2011 war in Libya and the ongoing proxy war in Syria. Iraq, Iran and North Korea were also on PNAC's hit list . Further illustrating the fact that many of the wars and proxy wars we have witnessed in recent years were premeditated operations by imperial powers, t he former French minister of Foreign Affairs, Roland Dumas, revealed that the war in Syria was ※ prepared, preconceived and planned § at least ※two years before the violence§ erupted. Dumas said he was approached in the UK by ※top British officials§ to see if he would participate in ※organizing an invasion of rebels into Syria§, a proposal Dumas refused, but it is clear that many others within the Western establishment did not.

    "title": "Obama's ※Swang Trip§ to Europe is No Reason for Tears | New Eastern Outlook",
    "text": "Region: Europe Obama's final tour to Europe in the capacity of US President has been a milestone event from various points of view. He has come as the representative of the losing side that would still try to reassure its European allies that America's polic ies toward s Europe and NATO will not undergo any significant changes d uring Trump's term. However, against the background of the turmoil in the EU political establishment, as the declining influence of Washington is aggravating internal feud in the EU corridors of power those promises fall flat. Moreover, Greece's public debt stands at roughly 180 percent of gross domestic product with 330 billion euro to be found somewhere by the ※rescue team§ of international creditors. The recent elections in Bulgaria and Moldova have stirred bitter accusations and pessimistic forecasts, as the sitting EU officials are convinced that the politicians that came to power in the above mentioned states are pro-Russian by their nature. That's why Obama has been desperately trying to calm down local pessimists by saying that anti-Russian sanctions will be kept in place and that the Iran nuclear program nuclear deal is not going anywhere. It's funny that Trump has already promised to do otherwise and Obama will have no say on this matter whatsoever in a short while. When Obama's tour to Europe was announced, the White House assumed it could be launched without any prior announcements that Obama was to meet Francois Hollande and Theresa May in Berlin. The announcement would only state that US President is going to visit the cradle of democracy (Greece) and Europe's driving economic engine (Germany). The French Le Figaro would publish a pretty bitter article, noting that France is a UN Security Council permanent members, yet its leader is being ordered around to follow Obama as if he was a courier in his entourage. It goes without saying that Italian and Spanish leaders are receiving the same treatment from America's lame duck. It doesn't seem that the way Washington is treating Hollande will help the latter to get reelected. It seems that US political elites are convinced that Merkel has overshadowed Hollande and now she's the only one to be treated with respect. The Foreign Policy would note : On what is his last tour of Europe this week, and what is likely to be his last major tour abroad, outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama has reserved a full two days for Berlin. This unusually long visit to the German capital is not a coincidence. It is here that he first became a figure of ?global importance? when, in July 2008, the then-candidate mesmerized a crowd of 200,000 Berliners. It is here that he developed his strongest rapport with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Most importantly, however, it is here that his foreign-policy legacy now has its strongest, if not last, line of defens e However, if Obama is such a fan of German Chancellor, how come the NSA and CIA have been tapping her phones for years. The scandal that outraged all sides of the German political spectrum was downplayed by Merkel back in 2015 in her bid to show her ※unparalleled loyalty§ to Washington and its masters. This position allowed the Obama administration to become the unannounced champions of law suits against German companies, that resulted in major settlements with Deutsche Bank paying 14 billion dollars to Washington, and Volkswagen parting away with 15 billion dollars. Therefore, it's hardly surprising that no genuine tears were shed when Obama was visiting Greece, even though Western corporate media sources heralded the trip as a ※major political event§. However, Greeks had an opinion of their own on this matter, launching massive anti-US protests in the Greek capital to ※honor§ Obama. In the end, local riot police was forced to use tear gas to get the situation under their control. A similar reception awaited Obama in Germany, but here he was not the only one to be envied, since Merkel is losing public support so rapidly due to her toothless position that most local politicians would try to avoid being mentioned in one sentence with the Chancellor at all costs. During his visit Obam would urge leaders of the European Union to be more forgiving of Greece and its debts. However, as the Bloomberg says , it's long past time for Europe's leaders to explain to their voters that financial distress is best dealt with decisively, not dragged out in perpetuity 〞 and that prompt debt relief is in their interests as well as Greece's. A continued policy of extend and pretend will cripple Greece's prospects, and if that happens, the economic and political costs won't be confined to Greece. It's curious that Trump's victory has turned a trip that was originally intended to showcase Mr Obama's foreign policy legacy into a US damage limitation exercise. Yet, bitterness is the best word to describe the reaction in Europe towards Obama's statements during this trip. It's being noted that the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the king of drones has done nothing to make this world a better or safer place. American troops are in Afghanistan, while the prisoners are still being tortured at Guantanamo Bay, the Middle East as a region is going down in flames and the Ukraine is now governed by fascists. That's how Obama's presidency will be remembered by. Yes, there are tears, tears of bitterness and anger! Nobody is saddened by the fact that Obama leaves the White House, but millions of people are frustrated by the fact that Obama would still be allowed to the world of international politics!

    "text": "Home ? Obama in Greece: The last flight of the lame duck Obama in Greece: The last flight of the lame duck 15.11.2016 \nBarack Obama begins his last tour as US president on November 15th. He plans to visit Greece, Germany, and Peru. The first place that President Obama is going to visit will be Athens. Common mockery \nAccording to the official statements of the White House, Obama is going to announce support for the \"ongoing efforts to stabilize the Greek economy\", as well as to appreciate the \"hospitality of the Greek government and people extended to the refugees and migrants\". Both statements may be considered an inappropriate joke: the Greek economy is still in very critical condition, and the country is facing a migration crisis leading to a humanitarian and demographic catastrophe. The Democrat's requests \nMoreover, Barack Obama is going to demand that the Greek government support the anti-Russian sanctions on the ballot in the EU in December, as well as ban Russian warships from entering Greek ports. In addition, Obama is going to demand that Greece remove its veto on Macedonia's entry into NATO. National interests against neoliberal delusion \nAll of Obama's demands for Athens are a classic example of the pressure exerted on national governments by globalists. Neoliberals demand the renunciation of individual countries' own interests in favor of a \"common good\". However, the reality is that following this course leads to ruin, degradation, and sometimes the total destruction of states. Related links",

It turns out that this broadcast reaches a pinnacle of listeners every four years, during the political campaigns. Recently, I learned, they have been bashing Donald Trump very heavily, and Hilary Clinton very lightly, if at all. Chevy Chase did a series of numbers on Gerald Ford in similar manner. Ronald Reagan was also nastily targeted. The issue came up, why didn't SNL also use Barack Obama as the butt of their jokes? The explanation from the ※experts§ brought in to this NPR show was that he was too ※cool§ to spoof, he had no characteristics that humorists could poke fun at, he was too wonderful to parody, etc. I wonder, can anyone think of any other reasons Obama was never dragged through the mud like other politicians? I can't think of any. This sounds like God's truth to me. But, enquiring minds want to know. 2:12 pm on October 28, 2016",

    "text": "Trump Suffers Bizarre Memory Disorder: Says He Always Opposed Obamacare (VIDEO) By Karen Shiebler on October 26, 2016 \nOh, ha,ha,ha! \nThat silly old Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is so, so funny! \nHe doesn't seem to remember anything. He doesn't remember what he has done , or what he has said , or what he believed or didn't believe in the recent past. \nNow we have another example of Trump insisting that he said what he didn't say, that he didn't say what he said, and that he never believed what he said he believed. \nConfused? \nYup. We are, too. \nMediate reports that Trump's memory about Obamacare is very murky, too. The candidate has been hitting the stump hard claiming that he will overturn the ※disaster§ of Obamacare. \nIn fact, Trump has been claiming to anyone who will listen that he has always been against Obama's health care plan. To listen to him, you would think that the man had taken to the airwaves as soon as the Affordable Care Act was passed, proclaiming that it would be the end of civilization as we know it. \nExcept that he didn't. \nAfter it was announced the other day that insurance premiums are going to be increasing this year, Trump pumped his fists and congratulated himself with his usual fervor. He crowed to Fox News: ※I think it's a disaster, and I've been saying it from the time before they even voted for it. I said this is a plan can't work, it's going to be a disaster.§ He told Rush Limbaugh that : ※Obamacare is a disaster. And you remember, I called that from before it was approved. I said, ＆This can't work, because it's just ＃ the plan is no good. The concept is no good.'§ \nOnce again, though, the truth seems to have nothing in common with Trump's faulty memory. In reality, back when the law was passed, Trump had not yet declared for the Presidency. He went on the air with Joy Behar on the day in 2010 when the law was passed. She asked him what he thought about the Act, and he replied that he had mixed feelings. \nTrump said that he hated to think about people being unable to get health care, but he worried about the cost to businesses. Then he commented on the President, saying: ※It's a pretty tough thing, but yeah, right now, he's certainly looking like a hero.§ So. Um. Mr. Trump's memory is pretty damn shaky if you ask me. It seems that he is either trying to desperately to revise reality in order to put himself in a better light, or he is suffering from a very serious memory disorder.

    "text": "Bill Clinton Gives The Rundown on Obamacare We Have Been Looking For (VIDEO) By Natalie Dailey on October 27, 2016 Subscribe \nEver since President Barack Obama passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) aka Obamacare, Republicans have been fighting against it. \nThe insurance companies are no longer allowed to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. It also set up a system of federal insurance marketplaces. The local media can sometimes make it sound more confusing without meaning to. \nPresident Bill Clinton helped explain it during a recent speech. He said : ※All the headlines are full of the stories that average premiums are going up 22 percent. But the subheadline is, if you're in the healthcare program, your subsidies are going up too so the increase won't be as much.§ \nAlso, 70 percent of people buying insurance on the Marketplace will be able to get a plan for under $75 per month. \nHe further said : ※So you've got one proposal, her opponent, just repeal it and go back to the way it used to be.§ ※That's a terrible idea. More than 20 million people would lose their health insurance. Families that can now insure their kids up to age 26 wouldn't be able to do it anymore and 100 percent of Americans would be worse off because you today cannot deny someone coverage based on a preexisting condition. We do not want to get rid of that.§ \nHe did talk about some of the disadvantages of the law, but it is still better than Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's non-plan . \nClinton said : ※The people who are getting killed in this deal are the small business people and individuals who make just a little too much to get in on these subsidies.§ \nYes, the co-pays and drug prices are high. However, the Marketplace is the only way some people can get insurance. If your employer doesn't offer healthcare or if you are self-employed, you would be screwed under the old rules. We need to fix this system, not throw it away. \nHere is a video of the Young Turks talking about Bill Clinton's Obamacare speech: \nFeatured image is a YouTube screengrab.

    "text": "Subscribe \nThe Obama administration recently announced measures to fight opioid addiction with treatment and prevention . It is hard to predict how these measures 每 and the new CDC guidelines 每 will affect chronic pain patients. However, in order to understand the many concerns patients with chronic pain have raised, it's important to hear about what they are already facing. \nWomen, particularly women of color, face a difficult time getting diagnosed with chronic pain conditions, let alone receiving treatment . Age also plays a role 每 young chronic pain patients may face difficulties in receiving accurate care. Several women with chronic pain shared their stories with me in an effort to display how difficult things already are for many of us in chronic pain. \nHoly, a young woman from Maryland living with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), shared some of her struggles with me yesterday. AS is a debilitating form of arthritis that mainly attacks the back and spine. As such, it causes a tremendous amount of pain which can escalate during periods called ＆flare-ups.' During flare-ups, patients may have to up medications such as corticosteroids (Prednisone) and pain medication. \nHoly has been refused medical care during painful flare-ups that caused her to go to the emergency room. Currently, she is in so much pain that she is unable to work or continue pursuing secondary education. \nShe feels that her pain could be better controlled with a higher dose of the opiate she is currently on, but fears the reactions and repercussions she will face by asking for that dose. Holy's insurance won't cover a consultation with a pain management specialist, something that many physicians are requiring in order to get away from prescribing opiates themselves. All she wants is to be able to function enough to pursue her education and have a semblance of Quality of Life (QOL). \nHoly's story is not unlike that of Britta in Minnesota, who currently has little pain management for her chronic illness-related pain. While she would like to ask for pain management and discuss medications, her insurance and health care organization have both put extreme regulations on opiates. \nOther patients, including yours truly, already experience issues when picking up opiates or other controlled substances for pain relief at the pharmacy. We are often treated like criminals, something that becomes more obvious when you hear about urine and blood testing for illegal drugs in order to obtain your pain relief. \nWhile the stories above are the most common I encounter, there are rare stories like that of Gwendolyn from Colorado. While she admits she is terrified of the effects of the new prescription guidelines, Gwendolyn sees a pain management specialist who has assured her that they will do whatever they can to make sure the process of obtaining her script doesn't change and that her QOL isn't negatively affected. Like Holy, though, she still has had negative responses when needing to utilize the emergency room. \nAn important note to make: Uncontrolled pain can and does lead to suicide . Patients who have little to no QOL and cannot access pain relief often feel as though they have nowhere to turn. Relationships suffer, contributing to a feeling of isolation and loneliness. There are some doctors who see this , who realize that pain and depression may be related, and who are reluctant to follow or are even actively resisting the various new guidelines. \nIt remains to be seen how the new guidelines will affect healthcare across the country. Reducing the number of deaths from opiate abuse is important, but we also need to be mindful of those in unending pain who may have no other options than opiates. Limiting their access reduces their QoL and will, ultimately, lead to preventable deaths. \nFeatured Image via Charles Williams/Flickr , available under a Creative Commons 2.0 license .

    "text": "BUSTED: Eric Trump Admits Daddy ＆Started The Conversation' About Obama's Birth Certificate (AUDIO) By Andrew Bradford on October 28, 2016 Subscribe \nDonald Trump has tried to deny that he is the person most responsible for keeping alive claims that President Obama wasn't born in the United States and is therefore not eligible to serve as President. The GOP nominee has been the chief proponent of what is now known as ※birtherism.§ And yet when asked about the matter, Trump tries to shift the blame to Hillary Clinton and her campaign staff in the 2008 Democratic race. \nNow, however, we have proof that Trump was indeed the driving force of birtherism, and that proof comes from the mouth of his son, Eric. \nNBC news found audio of Eric Trump talking to biographer Michael D'Antonio, author of The Truth About Trump . In that audio, the Trump son admits: ※I think with the birthers it's, ＆Okay, well, then, just prove it. Meaning these people are going out saying that which a lot of people were at the time. ＆Then just show us. Just be transparent. You're the leader of the free world, be transparent.' There are underlying themes to this, and in fact, he has done his best to start the conversation that was unwilling to be had before. Now that conversation might flush itself out in one of several different ways. But at least the conversation is being had.§ \nYes, at least we are trying to question the nationality of the first African-American President in the history of the United States. Nothing nefarious or the least bit racist about that, is there? Bullshit! Donald Trump knew exactly what he was doing when he repeatedly called for President Obama to release his birth certificate, and he did so to garner media attention as he considered running for the GOP nomination years before he finally did. \nDonald Trump is a lying weasel and racist asshat who needs to be defeated soundly on November 8. He and his hateful ideas must be resoundingly rejected by the American people, who deserve better than the division he offers. \nFeatured Image Via YouTube Screengrab About Andrew Bradford \nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.

    "text": "The Reason Why Jade Helm Is Obama's Favorite Conspiracy Theory May Surprise You By Kristie on November 22, 2015 Subscribe \nPresident Obama has had to deal with his fair share of conspiracy theories. Even before he was elected he had to deal with questions about his origin of birth. He's also secretly a Muslim masquerading as a Christian. One of the best is that he is going to unarm Americans by taking our guns. I'm still waiting on that one. But in a recent GQ interview , President Obama revealed his favorite conspiracy theory 每 Jade Helm. Featured image by Boricuaeddie , available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license. \nAs most will recall, Jade Helm was one of the largest military training exercise ever conducted on U.S. soil. In July of this year, roughly 1,200 U.S. military troops participated in exercises that spanned seven states. Jade Helm included New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. As we all know though, this exercise proved itself to be a great opportunity for the bitter right-wing to start up the conspiracy machine. \nWhile this resulted in great ratings for the likes of Alex Jones , Jade Helm turned out to be a 〞 military exercise 〞 not a military led plot for Obama to take over the country and stay in power as a dictator. No wonder Jade Helm entertained Obama. Only a right-wing nut-job would believe something like that. \nBut why is that Obama's favorite conspiracy theory? He explained after GQ asked : ※What's the most entertaining conspiracy theory you ever read about yourself?§ \nObama then answered : ※That military exercises we were doing in Texas were designed to begin martial law so that I could usurp the Constitution and stay in power longer. Anybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I'm going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.§ \nYou see, even the leader of the free world answers to somebody.

    "title": "Total Desperation Sets In as President Obama Plays the Woman Card",
    "text": "at 4:08 pm 1 Comment \nWith the neither the racist nor the Putin-puppet label sticking to Trump, team Clinton and its lobotomized surrogates have regressed back to square one: playing the woman card . \nAs I noted in a post earlier this week, a professor of linguistics at Berkeley just published an article at Time claiming (with zero evidence of course), that the Hillary Clinton email server scandal only exists because she is a woman. Here's a brief snippet of what she said: \n＆It's not about emails; it's about public communication by a woman' \nI am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It's us. \nThe only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she's doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. \nIt's not about emails; it's about public communication by a woman in general. Of course, in the year 2016, no one (probably not even The Donald) could make this argument explicitly. After all, he and his fellow Republicans are not waging a war on women. How do we know that? They have said so. And they're men, so they must be telling the truth. \nI know. It's really hard to believe the above is real, but it is. \nMoving along, President Obama himself is now getting in the mud. \nHere's what he had to say today in Ohio, according to NBC : \nCOLUMBUS, Ohio 〞 President Barack Obama said Tuesday that sexism is to blame for the tight race for the White House, telling an Ohio crowd that ※Hillary Clinton is consistently treated differently than just about any other candidate I see out there.§ \nObama went on: ※There's a reason we haven't had a woman president.§ \nSpeaking specifically to ※the guys out there,§ Obama told them to ※look inside yourself and ask yourself, if you're having problems with this stuff how much of it is that we're just not used to it?§ \nYep, because the American public handily elected a black man twice, but somehow we all draw the line at a woman. Perhaps, just perhaps, the problem is with Hillary. \nMoving along, all this reminded me of a very prescient comment made by Glenn Greenwald a couple of years ago, which I highlighted in the post, Glenn Greenwald on the 2016 Elections 每 ※They'll Probably Have a Gay Person After Hillary§ : \nHillary is banal, corrupted, drained of vibrancy and passion. I mean, she's been around forever, the Clinton circle. She's a fucking hawk and like a neocon, practically. She's surrounded by all these sleazy money types who are just corrupting everything everywhere. But she's going to be the first female president, and women in America are going to be completely invested in her candidacy. Opposition to her is going to be depicted as misogynistic, like opposition to Obama has been depicted as racist. It's going to be this completely symbolic messaging that's going to overshadow the fact that she'll do nothing but continue everything in pursuit of her own power. They'll probably have a gay person after Hillary who's just going to do the same thing. \nObama could've gone out on a high note, but he decided to go low. \nSad!",

    "text": "Print \nWhile Donald Trump talks of repealing and replacing Obamacare and Hillary Clinton talks of reopening the conversation about the public option , the state of Vermont has begun dealing its own personal health care crisis by invoking something called the ※all-payer model.§ \nThe Green Mountain Care Board on Wednesday voted to approve this methodology for paying for health care, but understanding what that means requires reading the fine print of the agreement. \nBy approving the all-payer model agreement, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin seeks to align incentives across Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance so health care providers are paid for keeping patients healthy, not for providing individual services and procedures. \nThe board's approval makes Vermont the first state to pursue an all-payer model statewide. \nIn a statement sent from the governor's office, Shumlin thanked President Barack Obama and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell for negotiating the agreement with the state, and he said the model would control health care costs and reward doctors for a more preventive approach to care. \n※Vermont will now become the first state in America to ensure that your doctor can focus on keeping you healthy, rather than running tests or procedures,§ Shumlin said, adding: \nBy shifting the focus away from the current fee-for-service system to one that rewards primary care and prevention, we will help Vermonters lead healthier lives and more effectively manage chronic diseases, allow doctors to better treat their patients and identify health issues before they become severe, and reduce costs in a health care system that, if left unchecked, will bankrupt our state and Vermont families. \nGreen Mountain Care Board Chair Al Gobeille called the event ※an important next step in provider-led health care reform,§ adding that the program will save Vermont $10 billion over the next decade. \nHowever, the board's action did little to address concerns raised by the Joint Fiscal Office. In a report released Friday , the JFO weighed the supposed benefits of the new system against a list of critiques and uncertainties. Among the uncertainties are the administrative costs of the program, as well as where funding will come from. \nThe JFO report also notes that the next governor could refuse to go forward with the program. Republican gubernatorial candidate Phil Scott has said he does not support the program. \nIn a statement sent to local media, State House Minority Leader Rep. Don Turner, criticized the plan. \n※The proposal raises many important, but unanswered, questions regarding the ability to cap healthcare cost growth, the use of the ACO model ＃ and the competency of the Shumlin Administration to successfully run another complex regulatory system given its dismal record with Vermont Health Connect,§ he said. \nDarcie Johnston, director of Vermonters for Health Care Freedom, said she was shocked at the speed with which the board approved the draft. ※Our legislators made a huge mistake in giving the GMCB so much power 〞 the power to enter into contracts to further destroy our health care system.§ \nAmy Cooper, executive director of HealthFirst, an independent practice association representing over 250 medical professionals, told Vermont Watchdog she believes ※the concept could be a good one§ but nevertheless is ※nervous about the State's ability to implement it, especially with such a short timeline of reviewing the details that were only released a month ago.§ \nShumlin will sign the revised draft document at 2 p.m. Thursday in his ceremonial office in Montpelier. \nOver the past month, health care officials held public forums to explain Vermont's 44-page draft agreement with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Still, many doctors and patients feel unsure of what the ※all-payer model§ will mean for them, in part because of the program's many complexities. \nFor starters, despite the administration's talk of an ※all-payer waiver,§ the draft document contains a waiver only for Medicare, not Medicaid or commercial insurance 〞 the other two ※payers§ in Vermont's health care system. Instead, the document gives state health care officials permission to operate accountable care organizations, or ACOs, under a restructured payment system. \nFor health care providers, the new payment system will start to replace current fee-for-service payments with a state-run global budget, the goal of which is to reward positive outcomes and overall population health. \nOnce the agreement is finalized, Vermont will start using its state-approved ACO, called the Vermont Care Organization. That network of health care providers is comprised of representatives from existing ACOs, including OneCare, HealthFirst and Community Health Accountable Care. \nThe smaller ACOs have not yet committed to being managed by the Vermont Care Organization. They have until 2018 to decide whether to remain as fee-for-service operators or transition to global budgeting within the Vermont Care Organization, as overseen by the Green Mountain Care Board. \nDr. Paul Reiss, chief medical officer at HealthFirst, told Watchdog his ACO is not recommending that physicians sign on with the Vermont Care Organization until details of the offer are known. \n※There's no proposal to change the way physicians are paid under Medicare in 2017,§ Reiss said. ※We'll recommend signing on when there are actually offers on the table.§ \nAt recent public forums, both Gov. Peter Shumlin and Al Gobeille, chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, said the Vermont Care Organization would be ※risk bearing.§ That means the umbrella ACO network, not individual providers, will absorb losses if providers exceed their budget for the year. \nWhile the risk-bearing stipulation may allay providers' worries about going over budget, page 8 of the agreement states that the ACO is responsible for ※at minimum 30 percent§ of shared losses. Put another way, providers in some cases will be responsible for paying up to 70 percent of the cost of exceeding the state-determined budget. \nDelivering care under a global budget worries some doctors, who may not be able to survive under a budget cap and offer effective care at the same time. \nWhen an audience member at the Norwich public forum asked what impact failing practices might have on the system, Shumlin replied, ※You cannot be refused care. ＃ It's the ACO's problem to deal with the bankruptcy. ＃ It would not affect care in any way. It might not be the same provider, because they would be out of business theoretically, but someone would have an interest in caring for you.§ \nGobeille agreed that private practices might face bankruptcy ※because they couldn't make it work in the independent practice world.§ He added that such practices could be absorbed into the hospital system. \nSince the draft agreement was announced , some physicians have criticized the plan on the grounds that hospitals may continue getting reimbursed for services at a higher rate, because of their bargaining advantage with insurance companies and the Green Mountain Care Board. \nWhile it's generally expected that the all-payer model will fix the payment reimbursement differential between Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurers, Reiss said he's skeptical. \n※There are no [plans] currently diagrammed on any drawing board to make that happen,§ Reiss told Watchdog. \nIn fact, the draft agreement doesn't fix the reimbursement differential. Instead, it says by 2020 the state must deliver ※a report on options to narrow the Payer Differential between payers.§ \nThe long delay could disappoint independent physicians, who have been told they don't have to join the state-run ACO if they don't want. That freedom of choice may be illusory at best, since financial pressure cited in the agreement could coerce doctors to join the network or face financial consequences. \nSpecifically, the draft agreement says the state will ※encourage§ providers and beneficiaries to participate. One ※encouragement§ includes a potential Medicare payment reduction for practices that remain outside of the ACO. \nHowever, in an Oct.19 email exchange obtained by Vermont Watchdog, state Sen. Tim Ashe, told Burlington psychiatrist Robert Emmons that he contacted Ena Backus, health policy chief at the Green Mountain Care Board, and the financial penalty is now removed from the updated agreement. \nFunding to help Vermont abandon a fee-for-service model includes a one-time payment of $9.5 million dollars from Medicare. The state also has a verbal agreement with Medicaid for $200 million 〞 likely $110 million in federal money and $90 million in state funds. \nIt's unclear where this money, and the administrative expense of Vermont Care Organization, will come from. \nOn Tuesday, Johnston unsuccessfully called for the board to delay its vote until outstanding questions are answered. \n※We believe that doctors and patients have significant concerns, and that the delivery of health care to Vermonters could be significantly impacted. We are concerned about the rationing of care,§ the Vermonters for Healthcare Freedom director said in a statement. ※＃There are too many questions that deserve answers before the Green Mountain Care Board should agree to support such a risky venture.§ \nOther concerns of Johnston's include a lack of transparency and the model's impact on Vermont's doctor shortage. \nA timeline of key events reveals the long road ahead for the all-payer health care model.",

    "text": "Print \nLast week, the UN's premier cultural agency, UNESCO, approved a resolution viciously condemning Israel (referred to as ※the Occupying Power§) for various alleged trespasses and violations of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Except that the resolution never uses that term for Judaism's holiest shrine. It refers to and treats it as an exclusively Muslim site, a deliberate attempt to eradicate its connection 〞 let alone its centrality 〞 to the Jewish people and Jewish history. \nThis Orwellian absurdity is an insult not just to Judaism but to Christianity. It makes a mockery of the Gospels, which chronicle the story of a Galilean Jew whose life and ministry unfolded throughout the Holy Land, most especially in Jerusalem and the Temple. If this is nothing but a Muslim site, what happens to the very foundation of Christianity, which occurred 600 years before Islam even came into being? \nThis UNESCO resolution is merely the surreal extreme of the worldwide campaign to delegitimize Israel. It features the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions), now growing on Western university campuses and some mainline Protestant churches. And it extends even into some precincts of the Democratic Party.",

    "text": "Print \n※Premiums will go up sharply next year under President Barack Obama's health care law, and many consumers will be down to just one insurer, the administration confirmed Monday.§ The Associated Press explains at this link . Arizona will see the biggest spike (a whopping 116 percent), while Oklahoma will see a spike of 69 percent and Tennessee, Minnesota and Alabama will see spikes around 60 percent. The national average will be about 25%, the Obama administration says. \nMary Katharine Ham recently wrote a column titled ※ My Defective Obamacare Health Insurance Product Just Blew Up . Last year, her insurance plan's cost went up ※by almost 60 percent.§ The plan had been purchased on the Affordable Care Act ※marketplace.§ This year, things got much worse: \nMy premium is going up 96 percent. Ninety-six percent . My monthly payment, which was the amount of a decent car payment, is now the size of a moderate mortgage. The president refers to these for thousands of citizens as ※a few bugs§ when to us it feels like a flameout. \nFor this astronomical payment, I get a plan with an astronomical deductible that my healthy family of three will likely never hit except in the most catastrophic of circumstances. \nBefore Obamacare, she, like many other people , had a better plan at a lower price: \nDuring the run-up to Obamacare, President Obama referred to these plans as ※junk§ plans, but my family and I received perfectly good care and service through them. We were responsible, healthy citizens consuming a small amount of health care, paying out of pocket for most of it, and making sure we weren't deadbeats should something catastrophic come to pass. Our health insurance was a rational and responsible purchase. \nBut thanks to Obamacare, that plan no longer exists, even though Obama got Congress to approve Obamacare by falsely claiming that ※If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.§ (A claim that even biased left-leaning fact-checker PolitiFact later called the ※ lie of the year .§) \nAs Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute noted in the Chicago Tribune, \nObamacare inflation impacts everyone. August saw the biggest monthly gain in prices for medicine, doctor appointments and health insurance since 1984. . .The average employer-sponsored family policy now costs more than $18,000 a year. \nThat means family coverage costs $4,400 more today than before the health law passed in 2010. So much for President Barack Obama's promise families would save $2,500 a year. \nFurther, the Government Accountability Office found the Obamacare website is a magnet for fraud. The office created 14 fictitious enrollees who were approved for $60,000 in health insurance subsidies. \nTurner argues that an expansion of Obamacare recently proposed by Hillary Clinton would ※double down§ on its failures, replicating on a much larger scale the flaws of the ※health insurance cooperatives concocted by Obamacare. The co-op program cost taxpayers $2.4 billion, but 17 of the 23 state co-ops have failed.§ \nObamacare has already reduced employment in most states by between 1.5% and 3%, according to Georgetown University's Tomas Wind. The ※healthcare law will slow economic growth over the next decade, costing the nation about 2.3 million jobs and contributing to a $1 trillion increase in projected deficits, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report released§ in 2014 .",

It shows just how far the Obama administration is willing to take its misguided and ill-informed Cuba policy. \nFor the past quarter century, the Castro regime annually introduced a U.N. General Assembly resolution blaming America's trade embargo for the island's chronic economic and social problems and calling for the end of the embargo.

These blunt patriots weren't messing around, and they sent a clear message to our lame duck president, who didn't like it at all. \nThe leader of the free world hasn't done much in his two terms of trying, and he's not about to start now on his way out of office. He has taken the liberty of awarding himself substantial tee time, only reserving his efforts and energy to promote who he hopes to be his successor, Hillary Clinton. As annoying at it is to watch him do nothing, it's worse to see him take a side to campaign with one candidate while slandering the other, which Donald Trump's supporters have noticed and are fed-up over it. \nThere's a war happening on our own soil, between sharply divided citizens who are sick of seeing democracy destroyed during this election. While Hillary has everyone from the mainstream media to our president in her pantsuit pocket, patriots are expected to just accept it, along with the skewed results 〞 and don't want to pay a single dime for our president to spit in our faces any longer as he promotes Hillary on our hard-earned tax money. \nA petition started on StandUnited has received 41,000 signatures from frustrated patriots who are asking Congress to stop paying our president as he plays favorites in campaigning for Hillary. ※ We the People demand that Congress withhold President Obama's salary, pension, travel expenses, etc. for any time he spends actively campaigning for Hillary Clinton between now and the election in November,§ the petition on conservative site states. \nWhile it's not unusual for the current president to endorse a candidate on their way out of the White House, ※Rarely, however, does that same lame duck President spend weeks or even months prior to the November election actively campaigning for his successor,§ the petition laments. \nConsidering Obama's salary of about $400,000 a year and the cost of Air Force One at $180,000 for every single hour of flight, the amount he's siphoning from an already strained budget for a candidate that a mass amount of Americans don't want in office is astronomical and insulting.

    "text": "BOMBSHELL: Leaked Emails Expose How Muslims Got In Obama's Administration Posted on October 27, 2016 by Dawn Parabellum in Politics Share This \nSince the mainstream media won't do their job, people everywhere are making it a point to go through the WikiLeaks emails to uncover the truth that the political elite are trying to hide. Upon perusal of the emails leaked yesterday in dump number 19, an interesting discussion surfaced, exposing how Muslims got in Obama's administration, and it's so unbelievable, you have to read it for yourself. \nUnder the subject line, ※ Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates, § we get some juicy insight into how these candidates got into the Obama administration. However, the first thing that should stand out like a sore thumb is the date of this email. October 18, 2008, was about 3 weeks before Obama was elected. Muslims were chosen to be in the Obama administration weeks before his ※election.§ \nThe date indicates that Gayle Smith and John Podesta were staffing the Obama administration with Muslims weeks before Barack Obama was actually elected. This is not mainstream information, but Mad World News noticed that Obama was ※transitioning§ to the White House long before the election even took place. Unfortunately, that is not the worst part of this email. \nThe fact that Muslims were selected for the Obama administration before the American public voted for him is not a good sign, but it doesn't look like Obama chose these appointments either. He's not included in the conversation about who will be in his cabinet, leading skeptics to believe that this is all a setup. The date on this is September of 2008, well before Obama was elected. Note the highlighted areas where Christians are specifically excluded. \nThe even more terrifying aspect of this email is highlighted. ※I excluded those with some Arab American background who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian.§ Those who selected Obama before the election handpicked Muslims for his Administration knowing he'd be ※elected.§ Not only that, they specifically excluded Christians. \nThis particular email does not list a reason why Christians were excluded and Muslims were chosen specifically because of their religion, but with several more days of WikiLeaks Podesta email dumps, we may get some answers. But, that's still not all. The email also indicated that a list for Muslim DOJ and judges would come soon. \nLater, in the email right before signing off, Preeta Bansal , an Indian-American lawyer who ended up in the Obama administration as the General Counsel and Senior Policy Advisor to the federal Office of Management and Budget from 2009 until 2011, says the Muslim list for the DOJ (Department of Justice) will be on its way soon. Not long after, the list of Muslim Judges and US attorneys to appoint will follow. \nNow, we know how the Obama administration was packed with Muslims, but we still aren't sure why. Maybe they were hoping to avoid discrimination 〞 or perhaps the reason is more sinister. Perhaps the infiltration of the US government with Muslims is a preplanned way to slowly allow the religion to permeate the West. Although that seems far fetched, this email is absolutely horrifying and nothing should shock us anymore after reading these leaked emails.",

    "title": "BAD News For Obama As FBI Exposes Damning Thing He Quietly Did To Hillary",
    "text": "Share This \nThis election is arguably the most important our nation has ever faced, and things seem to be reaching a boiling point for America. Proving just that is the bad news Barack Obama just got after the FBI exposed the damning thing he quietly did to Hillary Clinton 每 and it means trouble for everyone involved. \nAs many Americans were made aware on Friday, the FBI has reopened the investigation into Hillary's email scandal. However, a few theories circling the web indicate that the recent turn of events points to something much darker. \nIn fact, as Internet sleuths have more time to dig around the deepest corners of the web, it seems as though FBI Director James Comey's hand may have actually been forced when it comes to the investigation. Seeing how both Wikileaks and famed hacker Kim Dotcom have Hillary's 33,000 emails and are intent on releasing them in the upcoming week, the FBI was forced to make a move 每 but things only get more interesting the further down the rabbit hole we go. \nAt this point, the media is taking Wikileaks very seriously, and considering who could be implicated in the leak, something had to be done. In short, the theory suggests that several high-ranking officials up to and including Barack Obama are actually involved in Hillary's little scandal. (Photo Source: Red State Watcher ) \nAlthough she thinks otherwise, Hillary is actually a very small fish in the big pond of established politicians, and she's about to find that out the hard way. In fact, it seems that Obama may actually be responsible for the FBI pressing forward on the investigation. \nWith the theory picked up by Rush Limbaugh , a recent caller expounded on the belief a bit more, saying that Obama was facing a time crunch. In essence, knowing he would be implicated if the full email leak was made public, it would show his complicity in Hillary's illegal behavior, meaning that he has a pretty serious bullet to dodge. I know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally @TGowdySC @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump . 100% true. Retweet. pic.twitter.com/eir8r0FJ8M \n〞 Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 26, 2016 \nFurthermore, seeing how Kim Dotcom told everyone how officials could legally get their hands on Hillary's emails, this made the reality even more pressing. As more came out, Obama realized the only thing he could do to save his own skin would be to have Comey come forward and say that they ※miraculously§ found new emails pertinent to the investigation. \nIn order to do this, Obama and the other Democrats involved must have made a joint decision to throw Hillary under the bus. When all is said and done, America will be so focused 每 with many extremely pleased 每 that no one will even think twice about what's in the rest of those emails. (Photo Source: Red State Watcher ) \nAlthough this sounds like a win, many Americans want to turn it into a win-win and take down two birds (or maybe more) with one stone. Those emails are going to come out either way. Although Obama would like to divert your attention elsewhere, justice should come to all of those who break the law. Frightened Failed Obama gets Heckled & Dodges Reporters as They Scream Questions of James Comey Huma Abedin Hillary Clinton #HillarysEmails pic.twitter.com/bNw5XdDEjb \n〞 DEPLORABLE TRUMPCAT (@Darren32895836) October 28, 2016 \nWe've been told lies too many times from both Obama and Hillary, and it seems that the web they weaved is becoming rather tangled at this point. We all know that there is no loyalty in politics unless it directly benefits the person giving it. \nBarack Obama was endorsing Hillary Clinton, but it only stands to reason that the moment he was threatened, he'd throw her under the bus in the name of self-preservation. The jig is up and the Democratic party is going down. Let's just hope the FBI decides to sink those final nails in Hillary's coffin before the election and announce official charges against her. We the people are fed up, and just as Hillary once said, ※No one is too big to jail.§ Those words are coming back to bite her in the end.",

    "text": "Genius Kid Trolled White House Halloween Party, Idiot Obama Didn't Notice Posted on November 1, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This \nDuring certain holidays, Barack and Michelle Obama invite a few kids to the White House to join them in the festivities. However, the most recent incident wasn't like all the rest as one kid decided to troll everyone there with a genius costume idea 每 and our idiot president didn't even seem to notice what he did. \nYesterday, a few kids were invited to the White House Rose Garden in order to dress up for the annual Halloween trick-or-treat event. Although most kids were there for the candy and games, there was one costume that stood above the rest 每 a duck. \nNow, this wasn't exactly your typical duck costume with a kid inside, and he wasn't your ordinary kid either. As can be seen in a picture posing with Obama, the duck was actually bandaged with its arm in a sling, thereby actually making it a ※ lame duck .§ Obama meets kid dressed as \"lame duck\" for Halloween at WH pic.twitter.com/5q4l04b5pM \n〞 Jim Acosta (@Acosta) October 31, 2016 \nOf course, Obama is about to adopt that name after the election as he begins the home stretch of his presidency. Although he hasn't done anything except for forcing his legacy down America's throat, these are the few months where slacking off is actually accepted from a man in his position. \nAt this point, a few things are unclear, including whether this kid was suggesting that Obama was a lame duck for his entire presidency or if our so-called Commander-in-Chief actually caught the genius pun. While some say he took the comedic jab with a bit of humor, others suggest the moron missed the subtle trolling entirely as it was just one of the endless droves of children in costumes that he took a picture with. \nIt's unknown who was actually in the costume or if the idea came from the child or their father, but it's being shared around social media for good reason. Obama has been nothing but a lame duck for the past 8 years after idiot voters actually believing the ※hope and change§ spiel voted for the man twice. \nFortunately, his days of freeloading and kicking back are about to become a thing of the past. Although nothing will change during his ※lame duck§ months, freeloaders of our nation are about to get a kick in the backside when Donald Trump is elected. We have been doing nothing for far too long 每 it's time we kick things into high gear and actually do some great things, just like we used to do.",

    "text": "Obama and Justice Dept. Busted In Rigging Plot After Hillary Memo Leaks Posted on November 1, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics Share This \nOver the weekend, many of us were left cheering over the news that the FBI was reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton's private server. Unfortunately, our celebrating might be short lived. Democrats are already scheming with how to get her off with no charges, including Barack Obama and other top officials who were paramount in her walking away scot-free. \nIt seems that no matter how crooked Hillary is, Democrats will always swarm together to protect their evil queen bee. The whole checks-and-balances thing among our branches of government is completely thrown out the window whenever Hillary is involved, as she simply buys the silence of government officials, or if that doesn't work, she kills them. It should come as no surprise that the very same people who helped her walk away from her Benghazi scandal, are now flocking once again to save her ass. \nWe've all seen Obama's ※Justice§ Department in action over the tenure of his presidency, and it's anything but contrived of justice. Now, we're seeing even more evidence of their twisted schemes in practice, proving again that everything in Washington, D.C. is completely rigged. \nIn a letter to Congressional leaders, Obama's DOJ stated that when it comes to the investigation of over 650,000 emails on Anthony Weiner's home computer that they will ※work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible.§ \nWhile that might sound great and wonderful on the surface, most people missed who signed that letter of compliance 〞 Hillary's partner in crime, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik. The crooked man not only testified during Benghazi as to Hillary's ※innocence,§ but he is also really good friends with Hillary's presidential campaign chair, John Podesta. Kadzik and Podesta hung out and dined to celebrate the day after Hillary's Benghazi hearings before Congress, and Kadzik was mentioned a whopping 20 times in Podesta's emails that were recently released by WikiLeaks. \nHowever, the conniving doesn't end there. Rumors are already swirling that if Hillary does get into trouble with this new investigation, that Obama is planning to pardon her, even if it's done retroactively after he leaves the White House. \nIn a recent interview, Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Tx) said that win or lose, Barack Obama will simply pardon Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton. ※I think win or lose there's a presidential pardon in her future. Historical precedent was set when Ford retroactively pardoned Nixon. I don't think that's good for our country, but I'm afraid that's going to happen.§ \nEven more infuriating, if Hillary is elected president, she could simply pardon herself. Presidential pardoning powers come from Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution that states that presidents ※have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.§ Basically, as long as she's not being impeached, she could pardon herself and walk away completely free. \nOur Founding Fathers were so careful in how they worded our founding documents so that no one in government could ever become too powerful. But how do you plan for someone who encompasses the evil of Hillary Clinton, where she practically owns and controls every single person in Washington, D.C.? If this woman gets elected as the next president, we will soon have a lawless tyrant leading our country.",

    "text": "by Jerri-Lynn Scofield \nBy Jerri-Lynn Scofield, who has worked as a securities lawyer and a derivatives trader. She now spends most of her time in India and other parts of Asia researching a book about textile artisans. She also writes regularly about legal, political economy, and regulatory topics for various consulting clients and publications, as well as writes occasional travel pieces for The National . \nSince FBI Director James Comey's bombshell announcement Friday that the bureau was reviewing new evidence regarding Hillary Clinton's email tar baby, many questions have arisen每 among the Naked Capitalism commentariat, as well as more widely每 about the scope and details of the President's pardoning powers. There are a few things to clear up right away, because I've seen a considerable amount of misinformation bandied about as to what the United States Constitution permits. Readers will please indulge me if in the interest of keeping this post short and sweet, I don't debunk each and every wrong argument I've seen since Friday. If I responded to all the crazypants stuff out there每 tempting as that might be每 I'd never get to my main points. \nArticle II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution says that the President ※shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment ＃§ \nSo allow me to summarize the salient points. \nAbsolute Power, Can Neither Be Reviewed nor Overturned As a Matter of Law \nThe President's pardoning power is absolute. Pardoning decisions are not subject to judicial review, nor can any individual pardon be overturned by an act of Congress. The pardoning power's also unlimited as to offenses against the United States, so in theory, at least as a matter of law, a President could pardon someone for committing any offense against the United States ( I leave to one side the question of whether such an action would be politically possible). A President could also, at least in theory, pardon him or herself每 for anything except in cases of impeachment. \nNo Indictment Necessary \nIt's not necessary for someone to be charged or convicted of a crime against of the United States for the President to pardon that person. The most famous example of a President granting a pardon in a case where no indictment had been brought is President Gerald Ford's September 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon shortly after he resigned the office of President. Allow me to quote at length from Proclamation 4311 Granting Pardon to Richard Nixon : \nRichard Nixon became the thirty-seventh President of the United States on January 20, 1969 and was reelected in 1972 for a second term by the electors of forty-nine of the fifty states. His term in office continued until his resignation on August 9, 1974. \nPursuant to resolutions of the House of Representatives, its Committee on the Judiciary conducted an inquiry and investigation on the impeachment of the President extending over more than eight months. The hearings of the Committee and its deliberations, which received wide national publicity over television, radio, and in printed media, resulted in votes adverse to Richard Nixon on recommended Articles of Impeachment. \nAs a result of certain acts or omissions occurring before his resignation from the Office of President, Richard Nixon has become liable to possible indictment and trial for offenses against the United States. Whether or not he shall be so prosecuted depends on findings of the appropriate grand jury and on the discretion of the authorized prosecutor. Should an indictment ensue, the accused shall then be entitled to a fair trial by an impartial jury, as guaranteed to every individual by the Constitution. \nIt is believed that a trial of Richard Nixon, if it became necessary, could not fairly begin until a year or more has elapsed. In the meantime, the tranquility to which this nation has been restored by the events of recent weeks could be irreparably lost by the prospects of bringing to trial a former President of the United States. The prospects of such trial will cause prolonged and divisive debate over the propriety of exposing to further punishment and degradation a man who has already paid the unprecedented penalty of relinquishing the highest elective office of the United States. \nNOW, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, pursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution, have granted and by these presents do grant a full, free, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20, 1969 through August 9, 1974＃. \nWhat Can Congress Do? \nArticle, section 4, of the US Constitution grants Congress the power to impeach any federal officeholder: \nThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. \nFurther, note that, Article I, Section 1, specifies: \nThe Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. \nJudgment in Cases of Impeachments shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States, but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment, and Punishment, according to Law. \nA few considerations to note here, even though an extended discussion of impeachment is beyond the scope of this post. First, impeachment is a political process, with the penalty (to reiterate from above) limited to ※to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States.§ A party that has been convicted by the Senate in an impeachment proceeding ※shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment, and Punishment, according to Law.§ \nSecond, although we're all well aware of the history of impeachment proceedings and the presidency (e.g., involving Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton), Congress can actually pursue impeachment proceedings against all civil officers of the United States. And in fact, there's a long common law tradition of such proceedings. I mention impeachment only in passing because such power lurks in the background, particularly in divided government situations每 but I defer a more comprehensive discussion of impeachment issues in the current context until we know who has been elected President, and what the partisan composition of each house of Congress will be. \nWhat Will the Obamamometer Do? \nBack to the pardoning question. So, now that I've outlined the constitutional authority for pardoning, the main issue I wish to address is: What Will the Obamamometer do? \nOn first glance, it's obvious that a President who has been, at least to my mind, unduly concerned with his legacy, and who also fetishizes the concept of bipartisanship, would not want to touch the issue of pardoning Hillary Clinton with a barge pole. I should also point out that the Obamamometer has been an unusually timid politician, and has often articulated soaring rhetoric that's never backed by bold action. In other words, all hat, not cattle. \nWhat the Obamamometer wil do, I believe, hinges on the outcome of the election. \nIf Hillary Clinton Wins \nIf Hillary wins next Tuesday, I believe the Obamamometer will not grant her a pardon, for the simple reason that she won't ask for one. To accept a pardon from Obama would be tantamount to an admission of guilt for her email practices, the Clinton Foundation's activities, , influence peddling, and pay-to-play, among other issues . \nHillary Clinton as President can probably get away with foregoing a pardon, at least with respect to herself. After all, does anyone seriously believe that she will nominate candidates for high-level Department of Justice positions that will vigorously pursue investigations into her and hear activities prior to becoming President? I don't think so. \nThe more interesting question is whether she'll be able to contain investigations that have already started and will no doubt draw in members of her inner circle. I'm going to put these questions aside for the time being每 I promise readers I will revisit them if they're not moot, after the election. But in the interests of keeping this post short, and confining its focus on the main question at hand每 the Obamamometer's options每 I'm not going to delve further into these issues now. \nIf Donald Trump Wins \nIf Donald Trump wins, we're in a completely different ballpark. \nTrump promised in the second debate to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's (alleged) corruption (although I think the Wikileaks revelations should dispense with the need to put in an alleged, even in parenthesis). I believe he will have to follow through on this pledge. His smart move would be to ask his Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor每 nominally a Democrat每 who has extensive experience investigating complex financial frauds, misuse of information, and influence peddling. And if Hillary Clinton also understands this to be Trump's next move, this would leave her in the market for a pardon. \nNow, there's a lot of chatter out there that suggests the Clintons hate the Obamas and that the Obamas hate the Clintons. I've also heard it said that they're all great pals. \nFor the purposes of my argument, however, it really doesn't matter one way or the other. I think Hillary will ask for a pardon, and the Obamamometer will grant it. It will be justified on the grounds that she's suffered enough in losing the election, and that she's been the subject of an unprecedented political vendetta. The Democratic nomenklatura laid the groundwork for this point in the immediate aftermath of the second debate, where Trump was lambasted for calling for appointing a special prosecutor, if he were elected, into Clinton's activities. This pledge was taken as a beyond-the-pale statement of vindictiveness rather than as a logical follow-through to investigations launched during the administration of a President of the same party as the candidate, into serious allegations involving mishandling of classified information and other offences. And I might add, Comey's late innings interjection should suggest that these investigations were neither comprehensively conducted, nor concluded. \nGiven that Trump's next move is fairly obvious, I predict that the Obamamometer's is too. Hillary will seek, and he will grant, a pardon, while promoting the line that she's suffered enough in not getting her turn to be President, and that further, she's exposed to extreme vindictiveness from Team R. The unlikely outcome of a Trump victory will undoubtedly shake up the political, economic and cultural elite. It will trigger widespread concern that they might have to pay for their past sins. In order to forestall the possibility that punishment will indeed be meted out to fit crimes, wagons will be circled. The Obamamometer covets a reserved place at the top table, and to attain that, will have to deliver on a solution, and protect poor Hillary. Otherwise, no more summers on the Vineyard. \nThe more interesting question is how far the Obamamometer's pardoning power will extend: will he provide get-out-of-jail free cards to Huma Abedin, John Podesta, Doug Brand, Cheryl Mills, any other Clinton minions, even the Big Dog himself? (I do of course realize Bill is probably untouchable). I don't think so. Because although I have and will continue to criticize the Obamamometer for being politically timid每 not to mention intellectually not all he's been touted as being每 I don't think he's personally corrupt in the narrow influence peddling sense. So let's hope he takes the legacy stuff seriously enough to hold the line at a tightly-drawn pardon for Hillary only, in the unlikely event Trump wins next week. \nAs for the broader political issues每 what Congress will do to address these issues每 these will depend on the election results. Again, I defer further analysis until we see the election returns.",

DAPL would supersede the previous distribution arrangements, under which oil from this source was shipped by train. \nWhat's now occurring follows the playbook I suggested would be used in my September post, Dakota Pipeline Will Proceed As Feds Undertake Smoke and Mirrors Policy Reconsideration . And the administration is still promising to pay us on Tuesday. \nSoft, Sibilant, Sweet Nothings \nAs reported DeSmogBlog's Steven Horn, in As President Obama Hints At Dakota Access Possible Reroute, Tensions Swirl at Standing Rock 〞 which is worth a read for the additional details and context it provides, the Obamamometer said the Corps would consider rerouting following a continued consultation process. His key weasel words: \nright now the Army Corps is examining whether there are ways we can reroute this pipeline, so we're going to let it play out for several more weeks and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that is properly attentive to the tradition of First Americans. \nTo be fair, he did genuflect in the direction of the First Amendment and call for both authorities and protestors to show restraint (as reported by the BBC ): \nThere is an obligation for protesters to be peaceful, and there's an obligation for authorities to show restraint＃ I want to make sure that as everybody is exercising their constitutional rights to be heard, that both sides are refraining from situations that might result in people being hurt. \nStanding Rock Sioux Ask for DOJ Investigation \nThe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has asked the Department of Justice to intervene and investigate alleged civil rights abuses in pipeline policing, which has been conducted by state and local police and private security companies. North Dakota earlier this month approved an additional $4 million for policing the DAPL protest, raising total expenditures to 10 million . \nHorn's article features an embedded video showing a policing crackdown. Video: North Dakota police/military forces attack water protectors in Cannonball river with chemical weapons. #NoDAPL pic.twitter.com/gXTZ9umwLq \n〞 Unicorn Riot (@UR_Ninja) 2 November 2016 \nThe Wall Street Journal also posted video footage filmed yesterday. \nFaith in Vague Promises \nThe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe issued a press release in which they chose to take the Obamamometer at his word: \nWe applaud President Obama's commitment to protect our sacred lands, our water, and the water of 17 million others. \nWhile the Army Corps of Engineers is examining this issue we call on the administration and the Corps to issue an immediate ※stop work order§ on the Dakota Access Pipeline. And given the flawed process that has put our drinking water in jeopardy, we also urge the Administration to call for a full environmental impact study. \nThe nation and the world are watching. The injustices done to Native people in North Dakota and throughout the country must be addressed. \nWe believe President Obama and his Administration will do the right thing. \nYet as Horn reported, Greenpeace is made of stronger stuff: \nThe administration seems to be buying time to maintain the status quo and profits for fossil fuel investors,§ Greenpeace USA spokeswoman Lilian Molina said in a press release. ※There is only one option that is truly attentive to the Native lives and lands at stake: respect the rights and sovereignty of Indigenous communities by revoking the permits immediately.§ \nGreenpeace USA, meanwhile, called for Obama to reverse the Army Corps permit granted for the pipeline. It opined that Obama was engaging in a stalling tactic. \n※The administration seems to be buying time to maintain the status quo and profits for fossil fuel investors,§ Greenpeace USA spokeswoman Lilian Molina said in a press release. ※There is only one option that is truly attentive to the Native lives and lands at stake: respect the rights and sovereignty of Indigenous communities by revoking the permits immediately.§ \nWill Wider Audience Be Gulled? \nThe intended audience for the Obamamometer's remarks is much wider than those immediately involved in the protests. The BBC report notes, ※The protest has gathered widespread attention and social media support, prompting 1.4 million people to ＆check in' to the location on Facebook in solidarity. The Democrats are clearly trying to maximize turnout among younger progressives, many of whom have shown little inclination to support Hillary Clinton's candidacy. \nDespite the need to attract these votes, Clinton hewed to her game plan of offering few positive reasons to support her candidacy and missed the chance to make this issue one on which she'd stake out a progressive position. Instead, as Horn noted, she ※offered a wishy-washy statement on the project, using many words to say very little§, and which said in part: \nFrom the beginning of this campaign, Secretary Clinton has been clear that she thinks all voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects＃ \nNow, all of the parties involved〞including the federal government, the pipeline company and contractors, the state of North Dakota, and the tribes〞need to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest. As that happens, it's important that on the ground in North Dakota, everyone respects demonstrators' rights to protest peacefully, and workers' rights to do their jobs safely. \nOngoing Formal, Government-To-Government Consultations \nAs I wrote in September, \nThe Department of Justice, the Department of the Army, and the Department of the Interior waded into the controversy over construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline (DAPL) [yesterday], shortly after U.S. federal court judge James E. Boasberg denied a request for a preliminary injunction to halt its construction in his Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ruling. \nThe three agencies recognized: \n＃[T}his case has highlighted the need for a serious discussion on whether there should be nationwide reform with respect to considering tribes' views on these types of infrastructure projects. Therefore, this fall, we will invite tribes to formal, government-to-government consultations on two questions: (1) within the existing statutory framework, what should the federal government do to better ensure meaningful tribal input into infrastructure-related reviews and decisions and the protection of tribal lands, resources, and treaty rights; and (2) should new legislation be proposed to Congress to alter that statutory framework and promote those goals. \nThe three agencies continue to conduct these consultations on federal infrastructure decisions, with a key meeting scheduled for November 17 in Rapid City, South Dakota and the final session due to be completed via teleconference on November 21. Conveniently, these discussions will conclude after election day. \nPipeline Proponents Didn't Get the Memo \nUnsurprisingly, pipeline proponents opposed even the weak commitment seemingly made in the interview. Some of the parties to the pipeline have entered into long-term binding contracts with shippers in anticipation of the DAPL and its related facilities coming on stream later this year. Despite the announcement in the three agency statement that the Corps of Engineers would not authorize constructing DAPL on Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe until it conducted a further policy review每 and asking that§the pipeline company voluntarily pause all construction activity within 20 miles east or west of Lake Oahu§, construction on the rest of the pipeline has proceeded, so that now it is estimated that the DAPL is now more than three-quarters completed. \nThe Wall Street Journal quoted a spokeswoman for Energy Transfer Partners LP, which is constructing DAPL, as saying: \nthe company isn't aware of any consideration being given to rerouting the project. She said the company also expects to receive the final federal approval for a disputed portion of the pipeline in a timely fashion. \nIn an internal company memo on Sept. 13, Energy Transfer CEO Kelcy Warren said the pipeline was nearly 60% complete and that the company had spent more than $1.6 billion on the project. \nLikely Outcome? \nDespite the hopes and dreams of progressives, the administration will face heavy pressure to conclude its review process in time for those involved in the project to honour existing supply contracts. Alternatively issue may be dumped onto the incoming administration. The WSJ reported that neither the Trump nor Clinton campaign has taken a position on DAPL construction. \nDespite the Obamamometer's remarks, I'd be very surprised indeed if the Corps were to present a viable plan to reroute the pipeline at this late date. And if it does, further lawsuits would inevitably follow. 0 0 0 0 0 1",

    "text": "By Jerri-Lynn Scofield, who has worked as a securities lawyer and a derivatives trader. She now spends most of her time in India and other parts of Asia researching a book about textile artisans. She also writes regularly about legal, political economy, and regulatory topics for various consulting clients and publications, as well as writes occasional travel pieces for The National . \nAll right, all right. I can't take it any more. Yesterday I read a Facebook post that blamed the current US electoral predicament on the ※pointless§ 22nd Amendment. For those of you without a US Constitution handy, the 22nd Amendment is the one that limits US presidents to serving two terms. \nThat Facebook post implies that without the 22nd Amendment we'd get to see a third term for the Obamamometer . That risible suggestion, combined with the incessant legacy-burnishing that he's indulged in每 at least until he realized that HRC might be in trouble and started to hit the campaign trail in earnest每 made me realize the time for shredding aspects of that legacy is way overdue. \nWhen the Obamamometer finally settles on what he'll do next每 whether that would be run a sports team, become a venture capitalist, found a new religion, cure cancer, or merely hob nob with the global elite and play lots of golf, I'm sure he'll make a fine job job of it每 just as he's done with his Presidency. Over the next couple of months, I intend to post occasionally on this legacy: but rather than burnishing that record, I'll indulge in a bit of legacy busting. \nFirst up, the rule of law and corporate crime. \nThe Holder Doctrine \nFederal prosecutors, and regulatory agencies, have turned into toothless tigers when it comes to prosecuting C-suite types, and pursuing corporations seriously, for economic crimes. Both financial institutions and their management got virtually a free pass for their activities that led to the Great Recession. And not only for those, but for subsequent foreclosure abuses, LIBOR and other market manipulations, money laundering, tax scams, and doing business contrary to US sanctions policy. Yet to date, not a single C-suite type has been indicted. \nIt's not just financial institutions that've received a free pass. Big Pharma, for example, has also been lucky, as have companies that have engaged in creative tax minimization strategies (Apple, anyone?). And if looked at from the perspective of legal topics, rather than corporate actors, entire areas of law每 antitrust, for example每 are not really relevant anymore. \nYou don't have to take my word for it. No less a source than the NY Times' DealBook column每 not a venue, incidentally, renowned for its trenchant, timely critiques of either Wall Street or other corporate behavior每 in September lamented, Law Enforcement ＆Not Winning' War on White Collar Crime . I wrote about this article in a September post and so won't rehash all the arguments I made then here. But a few points are in order. \nThe lack of enforcement not only means that the guilty don't pay. It also determines what corporate strategies get pursued, which business models are developed or rejected, what attitudes corporations take to risk, and how resources get allocated to name just a few consequences. And as I'll discuss below, it also shapes how attorneys practice law, and the impact their advice carries in deterring certain types of corporate behavior. \nI never thought I'd be nostalgic for President George W. Bush's Department of Justice (DoJ). Now, I'm well aware of the scandal that ensued over Attorney General Alfred Gonzales imposing ideological litmus tests on assistant US attornies. Nonetheless, in the wake of the collapse of the dotcom bubble, the Bush DoJ actually enforced the law. It prosecuted cases and claimed scalps. Companies such as Adelphi, Enron and WorldCom all saw top-level management prosecuted, and malefactors sent to jail. \nChange We Can't Believe In \nThose who voted for Hope and Change in 2008 certainly got the change part每 at least with respect to the DoJ. But when we look at the DoJ's enforcement priorities and the track record that followed, it's perhaps not the change they were hoping for. The Obamamometer's first Attorney General, Eric Holder, outlined and followed what came to be known as the Holder doctrine. \nAllow me to quote from my September post: \n[Under the Holder doctrine the DoJ eschewed corporate charges against companies and executives, instead opting for negotiated settlements (often imposing de minimis, slap-on-the wrist penalties that were significantly undersized compared to the magnitude of damage done, especially by TBTF banks and other financial predators, to name just a few). \nThe DoJ under Obama's second AG, Loretta Lynch, originally followed the Holder doctrine, until that was superseded when Deputy Attorney General Sally Quillian Yates authored a memo outlining a new approach in September 2015. Under this approach, the DoJ intended to increase accountability for corporate wrongdoing, and this included an increased focus on pursuing criminal charges against responsible individuals. The DoJ sought to drive a legal wedge between individuals and the corporations for whom they worked by only allowing corporations to receive ※cooperation credit§ that would reduce their potential exposure (including penalties) if the corporation cooperates in surrendering as early as possible comprehensive detailed information concerning the individual misconduct. \nThere's much more in a similar vein in that earlier post, for those with an interest. But the bottom line for purposes of this post is what has this supposed policy shift, from Holder's doctrine to Yates's memo, meant in practice. The short answer: bupkis. We're still waiting for the more robust enforcement approach the Yates memo supposedly heralded to kick in. As an attorney I know who specializes in white collar defense work summed it up to me, ※The DoJ's walking a new walk, and talking a new talk, but nothing's really changed.§ \nIn fact, in only two areas have we seen the DoJ take a muscular approach toward enforcement during the Obamamometer's administration, insider trading, and offenses under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). \nInsider Trading \nUS Attorney for the southern district of New York Preet Bharara has compiled an undefeated string of convictions for insider trading (some of which may be at risk of being overturned due to some appellate decisions, which are beyond the scope of this post). But as I wrote last month in The SEC Fiddles While the System Burns: Insider Trading Enforcement As Securities Law Theater , focusing on insider trading as an enforcement priority constitutes a form of securities law theater. Scare prosecutorial resources are expended on insider trading abuses, rather than being deployed to investigate, punish, and (hopefully) deter, far more serious systemic problems. \nThe insider trading focus provides the illusion that the DoJ is doing something about high-level cheating. Yet it has little broader deterrent effect on stymieing the wider corporate scams that misallocate resources and erode confidence in the integrity of the system. Insider trading enforcement is usually directed at individuals, and doesn't implicate wider considerations of corporate strategy or policy. Prosecuting insider traders maintains the myth that the greatest threats to US capitalism are individual bad corporate actors, rather than anything more sweeping or systemic. Catch the bad actors, fine them or throw them in jail, and never think about any deeper problems. \nForeign Corrupt Practices Act \nAnother area highlighted as an enforcement priority is bribery and foreign corruption, with prosecutions undertaken under authority of the FCPA. Allow me to quote from a speech made by assistant attorney general Leslie R. Caldwell last week: \nThe effects of foreign corruption are not just felt overseas. In today's global economy, the negative effects of foreign corruption flow back to the United States. American companies are harmed by global corruption when they are denied the ability to compete in a fair and transparent marketplace. Instead of being rewarded for their efficiency, innovation and honest business practices, U.S. companies suffer at the hands of corrupt governments and lose out to corrupt competitors. \n＃. \nThis is why the fight against international corruption has been, and continues to be, a core priority of the Department of Justice. It has been a core priority for the Criminal Division, and our commitment to the fight against foreign bribery is reflected in our robust enforcement record in this area, which includes charges against corporations and individuals alike from all over the world. Since 2009, the Criminal Division's Fraud Section has convicted more than 65 individuals in [FCPA] and FCPA-related cases, and resolved criminal cases against more than 65 companies with penalties and forfeiture of approximately $4.5 billion. \nSounds reasonable, right? I mean, after all, no one would come right out in favor of more international corruption? \nBut when we unpack it, we butt up against a few problems. First, to quote my contact the white collar defence specialist again. The lack of an effective DoJ deterrent has enormously complicated his practice and his ability to get his clients to understand and act on prudent legal advice. ※What I've seen happening more and more in the last couple of years is the chairs of audit committees of major companies openly mocking the DoJ's enforcement capability.§ This leads the companies to pursue courses of action that they wouldn't dare to undertake if they worried that the DoJ would aggressively pursue securities law violations. \nWhere does this leave their lawyers? Well, it often means that they must either moderate their advice, or risk losing their clients. Clients who want to do something will resist their impulses and continue to listen to what they hear as their lawyers crying wolf only for so long. Eventually, the less scrupulous among them are going to ignore the contrary advice, or get another lawyer. The lack of effective enforcement at the DoJ hinders the efforts of the best, most prudent, and most ethical members of the legal profession to practice law as we would want them to. \nSo, what happens instead? Well, the most scrupulous of them will continue to give what they regard as sound legal advice (even if what some privately call the Department of Jokes does not enforce the law in a way that lends credence to that approach). But that means they often have to develop new areas of expertise when their clients beat a path away from their doors. ※We have to act sometimes as shoe salesmen, flogging competence in FCPA violations, that occur in subsidiaries or with foreign suppliers,§ says my white collar defense specialist contact. ※This work leads us to countries and legal systems we don't know well, to uncover chickenshit violations that occur far from home.§ Far better, he believes, would be for the DoJ to focus on law-breaking that occurs in the United States, as that could be effectively deterred by the agency refocusing its enforcement priorities. Now that would be a legacy we could all believe in. \nBottom Line \nOn the contrary, one persistent legacy of the Obamamometer is to say one thing and then do another. The DoJ has recently signalled its intention to get tougher on white collar crime. But so far, there's been no follow through on the rhetoric. Instead, we see federal prosecutors either turning a blind eye to major problems, or conducting various forms of enforcement theater每 much sound and fury, but in the end, signifying nothing. \nSome legacy!",

    "text": "Food poverty: 49 million Americans struggle to put food on the table as Obama's economic schemes collapse \nWednesday, November 02, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: food poverty , hunger , Obama administration (NaturalNews) A Democratic presidential nominee 每 Hillary Clinton, who is by far the \"establishment candidate\" in this year's presidential race 每 wants to take over from another Democratic president, Barack Obama. She is promising to carry on his \"successful\" economic policies by promising to essentially double down on them .And yet, by any true measure, the economy has been a disaster under Obama. Real growth has nearly flat-lined , real unemployment figures 每 when a proper count is taken 每 is far higher than what is being \"officially\" posted by the administration , and 43 million Americans cannot get enough food without government assistance.In fact, on that last point and as reported by Natural Blaze , in the Obama economy, 1-in-6 Americans are going to bed hungry on most nights, if not every night.And Clinton wants to double down on Obama's economic policies? How can such a great economic recovery produce so many hungry Americans? For the past eight years, Americans have had to listen to lectures from Obama (and other Democrats) about how we, as a first-world nation, should be able to afford things like healthcare and offer a free college education to our citizens (and, increasingly, to non-citizens ). But shouldn't a nation that produces so much excess food each year that we export it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars be able to feed its people too?Of course. But malnutrition during the \"great economic recovery\" of the Obama years is rising at an alarming rate in the U.S. That's because in real terms, workers' wages are falling, and it is becoming more difficult for families and individuals to earn enough to put decent food on their tables.\"For many, particularly the low paid [sic], this means two things: fuel and food poverty ,\" Natural Blaze reported.Low salaries combined with stagnant wages, jobs going to illegal immigrants and part-time work rising as Obamacare forces fewer companies to retain full-time employees, mean that food is increasingly seen as a luxury. And of those who can still afford food, many have to settle for cheap, nutrition-poor junk foods and foods high in starches, carbohydrates and calories. Now, winter approaches, and with it the inevitable supply challenges of natural gas and heating oil, which traditionally produce higher prices.But the establishment media is part of the problem. For example, in February Bloomberg reported that 1-in-7 Americans were on food stamps, despite an economic recovery . No one should ever be hungry in America unless they choose to be What recovery? Obama's economy is growing at about 1每2 percent a quarter 每 far below what is needed to sustain economic growth to the extent that it would lower our debt and provide well-paying jobs to the tens of millions needing them.So, the caveat is disingenuous. A more accurate story would have reflected on the 1-in-7 figure as it pertained to a real lack of opportunity among Americans to find better employment opportunities. In fact, the story makes no sense when you analyze it; either the economy is really good and a 1-in-7 ratio is no big deal, or the ratio is a big deal because the so-called economic recovery isn't reaching enough people. Which is it?It's the latter of course. And while America will always have a portion of the population that is too sick, too old or too lazy to produce 每 and they will be a net drain on the Treasury 每 the goal of any administration ought to be to adopt sound financial policies or to rescind policies that serve as impediments to economic growth. In today's America, that generally means thinning out the massive bureaucracy that is not only robbing millions of a better life because of their negative impact on business and industry, but is actually causing them to go hungry.And that should never happen in America. So why is it? Sources:",

    "text": "Americans' health deteriorating under Obamacare as life expectancies plunge \nWednesday, November 02, 2016 by: Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags: Americans , life expectancy , plummeting health (NaturalNews) For many years, the assumption has been that the United States leads the world as an advanced civilization, dominating in categories like education, quality of life, and life expectancy. But a new study released this year by the Society of Actuaries (SOA) paints a much different picture, suggesting that Americans are less healthy and will more than likely live much shorter lives compared to those in previous generations.The 36-page report reveals that the average 65-year-old American man today will most likely die just short of his 86th birthday, while the average 65-year-old American woman only has about two years longer until she dies, on average, around age 88. This might not sound like anything out of the ordinary, except that these figures are actually down compared to last year's report using the same criteria.Over the past several years, the report explains, American health has taken a major downturn. Life expectancy amongst 65-year-olds is down by about six months, on average. It's also down for younger Americans, who are likewise expected to live about six months less than in previous generations. In nearly every generational category, including \"Baby Boomers,\" \"Generation X,\" and \"Millennials,\" life expectancy is down, and will likely continue to go down.This is especially the case among middle-aged, non-Hispanic whites, who a recent study by Princeton University found are increasingly succumbing to the detrimental effects of bad habits like alcohol and drug abuse, unhealthy diet, and lack of exercise. This report also highlights increasing rates of suicide within younger populations, a sad state of affairs that says even more about the current state of our society.Mortality rates are still rising, the data suggests, but at an increasingly lower rate. And if things continue on the current trajectory, eventually overall life expectancy will be on the downturn 每 that is, unless the factors contributing to this decline are addressed and brought to bear. If they aren't, the average American life will likely continue to decline into the future. Pension payers, insurance companies see dollar signs as people die earlier While the study's findings have many applications in terms of social science research , the one area where they're making the biggest ripples involves employee pensions. By looking at this new life expectancy data through the lens of post-retirement disbursements, employers can determine whether or not their liabilities will increase or decrease 每 and based on the most current data, it appears that a decrease is on the way.\"The updated scale provides the latest information to help accurately measure pension obligations,\" says Dale Hall, managing director of research at the SOA. \"However, it is up to pension plan sponsors, working with their plan actuaries, to determine how to incorporate emerging mortality improvement data into their plan valuations.\"With the growing popularity of 401k accounts as opposed to pensions , the new data can also help employees who handle their own retirement affairs better ascertain how much they need to make, and how much they need to save, to live comfortably until their deaths. All of this information makes a difference when determining the price of annuities and insurance contracts whereby insurance companies are obligated to pay out until the time a person dies.Year-over-year changes in mortality are very volatile,\" Hall adds, noting that something as simple as a bad flu season can disrupt the death rate averages.At the same time, some experts claim that longevity rates in the long-term are still on an upward trajectory, and that soon-to-be retirees and younger folks alike need to take into account the fact that they could live much longer than the latest figures suggest, and to plan accordingly.

    "title": "Republican Leader Now Proposes Taking Away Seniors' Healthcare; Blames Obama 每 New Century Times",
    "text": "Share on Facebook \nPresident Obama is just weeks away from leaving office. Our biggest nightmare, backed by a fully Republican Congress, is about to take over. What that means, other than a far more hateful environment throughout the nation, is that a lot of people will lose a lot. Millions will lose healthcare. They don't care. The national parks could be put on the auction block. They don't care. Republicans have already started stripping seniors of their healthcare, and don't let them try to sell you on the benefits of privatization. There aren't any. \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan appeared on Special Report on Fox with Bret Baier. Ryan, now that he has a Republican in the White House, is set to start right away repealing the Affordable Care Act even Medicare. Well, he wants to privatize Medicare. \n※Your solution has always been to put things together, including entitlement reform,§ says Baier, using Republican code for privatizing Medicare. Ryan replies, ※If you're going to repeal and replace Obamacare, you have to address those issues as well. ＃ Medicare has got some serious issues because of Obamacare. So those things are part of our plan to replace Obamacare.§ \nRyan tells Baier, ※Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke.§ This is false. In fact, it's the complete opposite of the truth. The Medicare trust fund has been extended 11 years as a result of the passage of Obamacare, whose cost reforms have helped bring health care inflation to historic lows. It is also untrue that repealing Obamacare requires changing traditional Medicare. But Ryan clearly believes he needs to make this claim in order to sell his plan, or probably even to convince fellow Republicans to support it. \nSource: Reverb Press \nHere's the video: \nRyan, as usual, has it completely backwards. The Affordable Care Act is keeping Medicare afloat. Medicare is also solvent until 2028 and it's an easy fix to keep it solvent beyond that. \nHealth reform, along with other factors, has significantly improved Medicare's financial outlook, boosting revenues and making the program more efficient. The HI trust fund is now projected to remain solvent 11 years longer than before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. And the HI program's projected 75-year shortfall of 0.73 percent of taxable payroll is much less than the 3.88 percent of payroll that the trustees estimated before health reform. (See Figure 1.) This means that Congress could close the projected funding gap by raising the Medicare payroll tax 〞 now 1.45 percent each for employers and employees 〞 to about 1.8 percent, or by enacting an equivalent mix of program cuts and tax increases. \nSource: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \nWhat privatization would mean to seniors is that instead of direct coverage, they would get subsidies from which seniors would have to buy their own insurance. Now, let's forget for a moment that the subsidies will probably not be enough to pay for private coverage, which is much, much more expensive, but if the Affordable Care Act is overturned, it will mean that preexisting conditions will be back. It's a rare senior (or person) who doesn't have at least one preexisting condition. In other words, privatizing Medicare will be a huge giveaway to insurance companies, but seniors will be screwed.",

    "text": "Share on Facebook \nRepublicans in Congress and perhaps across the nation are suffering today from a case of buyers remorse after Trump begins back peddling on several of his campaign promises, before he even takes office. \nOver the last few days, he backed off on his claim that he'll repeal Obamacare by saying he'd just tweak it. He's seemed to have changed his mind on prosecuting Hillary Clinton and he's no longer talking about banning Muslims. While ※drain the swamp,§ which referred to Washington's culture of corruption, was one of his later campaign slogans, he's filling his cabinet posts with Washington insiders and corporate lobbyists. He's even appearing to change his mind about his signature issue, the wall between the United States and Mexico . \nOne piece of Trump's campaign rhetoric was actually something that would make people's lives better and it's something that Republicans are going to hate. His proposal for student loans is radical, in that it's not a gift to Wall Street and it's even more liberal than anything President Obama has proposed. In a rally just a month ago, Trump said about student loans: \n※We would cap repayment for an affordable portion of the borrower's income, 12.5 percent, we'd cap it. That gives you a lot to play with and a lot to do,§ Trump said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday. ※And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we'll let them get on with their lives. They just go ahead and they get on with their lives.§ \n※Students should not be asked to pay more on the debt than they can afford,§ Trump said. ※And the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.§ \nSource: Washington Post \nTrump's proposed debt forgiveness program is actually pretty similar to Obama's . Instead of a 12.5 percent cap, Obama introduced a cap of 10 percent of a graduate's income. Trump's program, though, would leave graduates with five fewer years of debt. Trump's would forgive debt after 15 years while Obama's would forgive after 10. In that one significant way, Trump's program is even more liberal than Obama's and if he carries it out, Congressional Republicans may have no choice but to turn on their party's President. \nThe American Enterprise Institute is a Washington think tank who issues a lot of the marching orders of Republicans. They were the driving force behind the Iraq war and of failed trickle down economics. This is what they have to say about student loan debt forgiveness: \n※They are way off on their numbers,§ said Jason Delisle, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. ※If you were going to give loan forgiveness in 15 years, you're going to forgive a lot more debt than you're going to make up for in the form of the higher payments they're proposing, by a lot. I don't even need to run the numbers. It's so obvious.§ \nReally, it's not obvious. Forgiving student debt would be a big boost to the economy because it would 1.) incentivize people to become more educated and 2.) put more money back into the economy because graduates would be free to buy more. Not that Republicans care about that, though. They prefer that graduates owe their lives to Wall Street banks and in turning his back on that, Trump is violating literally everything his party stands for.",

Evidently Attorney General Lynch and the Department of Justice have decided ＆refusal to cooperate' is their best strategy. by Geoffrey Grider October 28, 2016 Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration's secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has ※pleaded the Fifth§ Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments \nSen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. \nIn an Oct. 24 response , Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch's behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran . Loretta Lynch Pleads the Fifth To Protect Obama In Iran $1.7 Billion Hostage Money \nThe response from the attorney general's office is ※unacceptable§ and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to ※essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her] role in providing cash to the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism,§ Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch, according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon . \nThe inquiry launched by the lawmakers is just one of several concurrent ongoing congressional probes aimed at unearthing a full accounting of the administration's secret negotiations with Iran. \n※It is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the people's elected representatives in Congress about an important national security issue,§ the lawmakers wrote. ※Your staff failed to address any of our questions, and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue.§ Obama on Iran payment: ＆We do not pay ransom' \n※As the United States' chief law enforcement officer, it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries,§ they stated. ※The actions of your department come at time when Iran continues to hold Americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison.§ The lawmakers included a copy of their previous 13 questions and are requesting that Lynch provide answers by Nov. 4. \nWhen asked about Lynch's efforts to avoid answering questions about the cash payment, Pompeo told the Free Beacon that the Obama administration has blocked Congress at every turn as lawmakers attempt to investigate the payments to Iran. \n※Who knew that simple questions regarding Attorney General Lynch's approval of billions of dollars in payments to Iran could be so controversial that she would refuse to answer them?§ Pompeo said. ※This has become the Obama administration's coping mechanism for anything related to the Islamic Republic of Iran〞hide information, obfuscate details, and deny answers to Congress and the American people.§ Obama Administration Finally Admits $400M To Iran Was Ransom For Hostages \n※They know this isn't a sustainable strategy, however, and I trust they will start to take their professional, and moral, obligations seriously,§ the lawmaker added. \nIn the Oct. 24 letter to Rubio and Pompeo, Assistant Attorney General Kadzik warned the lawmakers against disclosing to the public any information about the cash payment. \nDetails about the deal are unclassified, but are being kept under lock and key in a secure facility on Capitol Hill, the Free Beacon first disclosed . Lawmakers and staffers who have clearance to view the documents are forced to relinquish their cellular devices and are barred from taking any notes about what they see. \n※Please note that these documents contain sensitive information that is not appropriate for public release,§ Kadzik wrote to the lawmakers. ※Disclosure of this information beyond members of the House and Senate and staff who are able to view them could adversely affect the diplomatic relations of the United States, including with key allies, as well as the State Department's ability to defend [legal] claims against the United States [by Iran] that are still being litigated at the Hague Tribunal.§ \n※The public release of any portion of these documents, or the information contained therein, is not authorized by the transmittal of these documents or by this communication,§ Kadzik wrote. Congressional sources have told the Free Beacon that this is another part of the effort to hide details about these secret negotiations with Iran from the American public. \nOne senior congressional source familiar with both the secret documents and the inquiry into them told the Free Beacon that the details of the negotiations are so damning that the administration's best strategy is to ignore lawmakers' requests for more information. \n※Every Obama administration official and department involved in the Iran Deal appear to be running for cover,§ the source said. ※Like we feared, the Iran deal is turning out to be a disaster and Iran is emboldened in its aggression.

    "text": "OBAMA GIVES TRUMP A GIFT: ObamaCare Collapsing Nationwide One Week Before Election Day A look at what happened in Arizona shows the cascading effects of problems with the design and implementation of the ACA, combined with early missteps by insurers. Some priced plans aggressively, angling for market share and betting special programs built into the law would protect them from losses. Those protections didn't work as expected. Enrollees' health-care expenses repeatedly overshot the projections of nearly all Arizona's insurers. The result: a flood of red ink, then withdrawals and premium increases.   When Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces launched in fall 2013, Arizona seemed like a success. Eight insurers competed to sign up consumers, offering a wide variety of plans and some of the lowest premiums in the country. \nToday, with ACA enrollment starting Nov. 1 , Arizonans will find in most counties only one insurer selling exchange plans for 2017. Premiums for some plans will be more than double this year, some of the biggest increases in the nation. Only last-minute maneuvering prevented one Arizona county from becoming the first in the nation to have no exchange insurers at all. \nA similar dynamic is playing out in other states' exchanges, which are a critical centerpiece of the 2010 health law. About one-third of U.S. counties will have just one exchange insurer next year , up from 7% this year, estimates the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health-care issues. In many cases, remaining insurers are seeking significant rate increases. Obama on Showing ACA Works: ＆We're Not Going To Get That Much Help Through the Media' \nA look at what happened in Arizona shows the cascading effects of problems with the design and implementation of the ACA, combined with early missteps by insurers. Some priced plans aggressively, angling for market share and betting special programs built into the law would protect them from losses. Those protections didn't work as expected. Enrollees' health-care expenses repeatedly overshot the projections of nearly all Arizona's insurers. The result: a flood of red ink, then withdrawals and premium increases. \n※The Arizona market is the poster child for the problems the exchanges are experiencing nationally,§ says Tom Snook, a Phoenix-based actuary for consultants Milliman Inc. \nOpponents of the health law have cited the problems in Arizona and other states to argue for unraveling the legislation, and they have proposed changes such as expanding health-savings accounts and allowing insurers to sell plans across state lines. Trump: My employees are having problems with Obamacare \nObama administration officials say they are bolstering the exchanges, and the consumer impact of premium increases will be limited by the law's subsidies for lower-income people, received by about 85% of enrollees nationally. ※We're making really good progress in addressing a lot of the issues,§ says Kevin Counihan, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services unit charged with implementing the health law. He calls Arizona an ※outlier,§ saying that insurers elsewhere have succeeded with ACA plans. \nThe ACA transformed the individual insurance market, where consumers buy their own plans. Before the law, insurers could refuse to sell to people with pre-existing health conditions. Starting in 2014, consumers couldn't be denied coverage, or charged more, if they were ill. Individuals could shop for plans via an online marketplace. Partly to ensure that healthy people signed up to balance out the sick, the law contained penalties for most people if they didn't obtain coverage. Arizona expanded Medicaid, as the law envisioned. \nInsurers saw uncertainty in the new marketplace, but also potential. They had to guess what prices they needed to charge to cover the health costs of new enrollees. A 2013 Society of Actuaries report suggested that the Arizona individual-insurance market could more than double, growing to 570,681 consumers, with more than 80% of them buying through the exchange. The health-care costs of the newer customer base would be around 22% higher than the old one, it suggested. President dodges blame for Obamacare premium increases \nInsurers believed they had protective guardrails 〞programs in the law to limit losses for companies that drew a lot of unhealthy, high-cost consumers. One insurer, Health Net Inc., told investors in November 2013 it could effectively pay out $1.20 in claims for each $1 it got in premiums and still break even with help from an ACA program called ※risk corridors.§ Some of Health Net's Arizona products were among the lowest-priced in the country, according to Kaiser. \nKim Walton, 62 years old, of Tempe, says his monthly insurance bill dropped by more than two-thirds compared with his pre-ACA plan, with help from a federal subsidy. Unlike his old plan, his new ACA insurance covered any costs tied to his pre-existing health conditions〞he earlier had a hip replacement and suffered a broken neck. ※It was perfect,§ says Mr. Walton, who owns his own business. \nKrysti Horwitz of Phoenix steered clear of the exchange. Ms. Horwitz, 35, and her husband, who own an online-marketing business, were healthy. In 2013, they had a plan that she said cost them significantly less than a new ACA one would. They weren't eligible for subsidies. They decided to keep what they had, an option the Obama administration authorized in late 2013. \nBy spring of 2014, with the first year of the new ACA plans barely under way, insurers had to guess again at pricing. Rate requests for 2015 plans were due, though insurers still had scant information about who signed up. That was partly because federal officials extended the deadline for enrollment after technical problems with HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange being used in Arizona and many other states. \nOne thing was already clear: Health Net's low-price gambit had won huge market share. The company ended up with nearly 92,000 enrolled in individual plans in 2014, more than seven times its 2013 total, according to insurance-data firm Mark Farrah Associates' Health Coverage Portal. \nThat posed a challenge for rivals, including startup Meritus, one of the nonprofit cooperative plans launched under the ACA. Meritus drew only a few thousand consumers in 2014, and it needed to boost enrollment to sustain itself, according to Tom Zumtobel,the co-op's former CEO, who took over in late 2014. \nMeritus worked to reduce its prices, and its rates came in below competitors' in 2015. \nOnce again that year, Arizona had some of the lowest exchange premiums in the U.S., and one of the most competitive marketplaces, with 11 insurers, according to the Kaiser data. Enrollment grew, particularly at Meritus, where it surged to about 48,000 in 2015, according to Mark Farrah Associates. \nOn Oct. 1, 2015, insurers got a huge blow: Federal regulators announced the risk-corridor program, which many companies expected to limit their financial risk, would pay out only 12.6% of the amount expected . The program hadn't taken in enough money from successful insurers to cover the requests of those with significant losses. \nFor Meritus, it was ※operationally devastating,§ says Mr. Zumtobel. That Oct. 30, just two days before consumers were set to start buying their 2016 exchange plans, Arizona's regulator put the co-op under supervision, barring it from selling new insurance policies. \nRemaining insurers began retrenching. The 2016 plans included more-limited networks of health-care providers. The total number of exchange insurers ticked down to eight, from 11, and premiums rose. ※We started to see the cracks,§ says Jerry Anderson, an insurance agent in Scottsdale, Ariz. \nNearly all the Arizona individual business of exchange insurers plunged into the red, according to Mark Farrah Associates, the insurance-data firm. Health Net booked nearly $40 million in losses on its Arizona individual business in 2014, and another $39 million the following year, according to Mark Farrah Associates, when the insurer agreed to be acquired by Centene Corp. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, the biggest player in the state's individual market, had priced less aggressively than Health Net but still saw steep losses. \nBased on regulatory filings, McKinsey & Co. estimated the insurance industry suffered cumulative losses of between 9% and 11% of premium revenue on individual plans last year. Only about one-quarter of insurers reported a profit on the business. \nIn Arizona, insurers set their rates too low to cover their enrollees' health expenses. There were fewer people than actuaries once projected, with about 203,000 choosing exchange plans during the enrollment period for this year. The share of enrollees who were healthy was smaller than companies projected, partly because the law's penalties weren't enough to prod them to enroll, insurers say. The unhealthy people who did sign up were more costly. Insurers say that some consumers appeared to be buying plans specifically when they had health needs. \nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona's ACA plans in 2014 were priced around 35% higher on average than its individual plans in 2013. ※In hindsight, it wasn't even close to enough,§ says Jeff Stelnik, a senior vice president at the nonprofit. ACA-plan enrollees had medical costs around 250% higher on average than individual members before the health law, due partly to far higher prevalence of conditions such as diabetes, he says. \nInsurers began to bail out. On April 19, UnitedHealth Group Inc. said it would pull out of nearly all state ACA exchanges , including Arizona's, for the next year amid growing losses. Others in Arizona retreated, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona and Health Net, which decided to pull out of the state's most populous county, Maricopa, as well as adjacent Pinal, for 2017. On Aug. 15, Aetna Inc. announced it would leave most of its exchanges , including Arizona's. Aetna's decision created a crisis: Pinal County would have no exchange insurers for 2017. The void would short-circuit a central mechanism of the law, because consumers can get subsidies only through an ACA marketplace. \nThe situation drew attention from Republicans critical of the ACA, including Arizona Sen. John McCain . He introduced a bill meant to ※protect AZ from Obamacare collapse,§ according to a press release. Obama administration officials said they believed the situation would be resolved. \nIn September, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona announced it would continue to sell exchange plans in Pinal next year after all. The decision came after state and federal regulators ※expressed their concern for Pinal residents,§ though the insurer made the call on its own, says Blue Cross's Mr. Stelnik. \nNeighboring Maricopa County, the state's most populous, also ended up with just one insurer〞Centene, Health Net's new parent, which announced Sept. 14 it would sell exchange plans there next year. Centene CEO Michael F. Neidorff says his company has a very different approach from Health Net, which he says ※thought they would get the revenue, the growth,§ and relied on ACA risk programs for protection. Centene said it expects to be profitable in Arizona, as it has been in other exchanges. \nThat left only one county in Arizona, Pima, with more than one exchange insurer〞it has two. There will be a few more options sold outside the exchange, to people who don't get federal subsidies. \nPremium increases are steep, though the effect will be blunted for those who get subsidies. Blue Cross's rates are up by an average of 51% from this year, Centene's Health Net unit's, by nearly 75%. \nMr. Walton, the consumer who benefited from lower premiums at the start of the exchange, worries he won't be able to find a plan that includes his primary-care physician and his cardiologist. ※I don't know what's going to happen come November,§ he says.",

Obama warned Tuesday that Americans and people around the world ※are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism, or ethnic identity, or tribalism§ taking root amid the populist movements that are gaining currency around the world. \nEDITOR'S NOTE: Why did the British people vote for Brexit ? Why did Donald Trump win in a landslide ? Because free peoples from any nation, once woken, will rightly reject globalism as a threat to individual freedom. NWO elites like Obama hate displays of nationalism like Trump's America First campaign because he doesn't believe America should come first. The coming Trump presidency is America's first ray of sunlight in over 8 years. \nSpeaking at a joint news conference with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras by his side, Obama refrained from criticizing President-elect Donald Trump directly as he discussed the impact of his electoral victory last week.

The 20th century was a bloodbath.§ Obama Full Press Conference with Alexis Tsipras in Greece: \nIf you don't wish to suffer through all the blather, fast-forward to 32:20 mark to hear his specific anti-America First mumbo-jumbo. \nObama, who made it clear during the course of the hour-long news conference that he did not view the recent U.S. election results as a referendum on his own tenure or world vision, suggested that targeting specific racial, religious ethnic groups could backfire. \n※In the United States we know what happens when we start dividing ourselves along the lines of race or religion or ethnicity. It is dangerous. It is dangerous, not just for the minority groups that are subjected to that kind of discrimination, or in some cases in the past, violence, but because we then don't realize our potential as a country when we are preventing blacks or Latinos or Asians or gays or women from fully participating in the project of building American life,§ he said. \n※So my vision is right on that issue, and it may not always win the day in the short term in any particularly political circumstance, but I am confident it will win the day in the long term,§ Obama added. ※Because societies which are able to unify ourselves around values and ideals and character, and how we treat each other, and cooperation and innovation, ultimately are going to be more successful than societies that don't.§ \nObama acknowledged that there was a common theme in the recent U.S. presidential election, Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union, and other populist movements elsewhere. \n※Globalization, combined with technology, combined with social media and constant information, have disrupted people's lives, sometimes in very concrete ways,§ he said. ※But also psychologically, people are less certain of their national identities or their place in the world.

    "text": "A Defeated Obama Condescendingly Mocks Winner Trump, Says ＆He Can't Keep Campaign Promises' Obama scolded his Republican successor for believing he can deliver on his campaign promises. 'I think that he successfully mobilized a big chunk of the country to vote for him,' Obama told reporters.   Barack Obama delivered a series of patronizing backhanded compliments to President-Elect Donald Trump on Monday during a lengthy White House press conference conducted before his final trip abroad as America's leader. While he praised Trump for pulling off ＆one of the biggest political upsets in history,' Obama scolded his Republican successor for believing he can deliver on his campaign promises . ＆I think that he successfully mobilized a big chunk of the country to vote for him,' Obama told reporters. But ＆regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up.'＆And those aspects of his positions or predispositions that don't match up with reality, he will find shaken up pretty quick. Because reality has a way of asserting itself.' Trump campaigned on an no-holds-barred agenda of dismantling much of Obama's agenda including immigration reforms put in place without congressional input, a widely criticized Iranian nuclear deal and an Obamacare system whose pilings have grown shaky. But the president suggested the billionaire's poetic rallies can never jive with Washington's messier prose. ＆I think it'll be important for him to have the room, to staff up, to figure out what his priorities are, to be able to distinguish between what he was campaigning on and what is practical 每 what he can actually achieve,' Obama cautioned. ＆You know, there are certain things that made for good good soundbites, but don't always translate into good policy. And that's something that he and his team will wrestle with in the same way every president wrestles with.' Ultimately, Obama hinted , he believes Trump is more a realist than a principled conservative 每 despite connecting with a previously disengaged voting base on the strength of broad promises.",

    "text": "Desperate To ＆Preserve His Legacy', Barack Obama Releases 527 Pages Of New Regulations In ONE Day! According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Obama administration has just shattered the old record for pages of regulations and rules published by the in-house journal, the Federal Register. At 81,640 total pages for 2016, it ranks first and 235 pages more than all of those published in 2010, the previous record.   17, 2016 President Obama has just set a new record for rules and regulations, his administration spitting out 527 pages worth in just one day, as he races to put his fingerprint on virtually every corner of American life and business. \nAccording to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the administration has just shattered the old record for pages of regulations and rules published by the in-house journal, the Federal Register . At 81,640 total pages for 2016, it ranks first and 235 pages more than all of those published in 2010, the previous record. The rules, politics of federal regulations under Obama: \nAs shocking as this video is , it was made 5 months ago and does not reflect the current race-to-regulate happening right now. What's more, there are still about 26 working days left in the year. \n※No one knows what the future holds, but at a pace of well over 1,000 pages weekly, the Federal Register could easily top 90,000 pages this year. The simple algebra says that at the current pace we'll add 11,190 pages over the next 44 days, to end 2016 at around 92,830 pages,§ said CEI's Clyde Wayne Crews. \n※This is astonishing and should be of great concern, and intolerable, to policymakers. It is remarkable enough that the all-time record has been passed before Thanksgiving,§ he added. Obama has promised to regulate by executive authority, but the sheer number of pages of regulations being rushed through is astonishing. \nStill, it's not a big surprise to CEI and other regulation watchdogs. \nThe reason, said Crews, Obama owns seven of the 10 highest-ever Federal Register counts. \nHe called on President-elect Trump to make good on campaign promises and cut regulations. \n※President-elect Donald Trump could take a page from President Reagan, who brought page counts down from Carter's 73,258 to as low as 44,812. We don't need a pen and phone, we need a meat axe,§ said Crews. source",

Hmm＃ \"Hillary Clinton has not been tried, but there are those who want to drag her for the next three years. It will not stop until they find a reason to put her in jail. That would be a travesty.\"\"It would be a monumental moral mistake to pursue the indictment of Hillary Clinton,\" Jackson said. He said issuing the pardon could help heal the nation, like Ford's pardon of Nixon did.   16, 2016 Speaking at President Gerald Ford's alma mater, The Rev. Jesse Jackson called for President Obama to issue a blanket pardon to Hillary Clinton before he leaves office, just like Ford did for Richard Nixon. \nStopping short of saying Clinton did anything wrong , Jackson told a large crowd of University of Michigan students, faculty and administrators gathered at daylong celebration of his career that Obama should short-circuit President-elect Donald Trump's promised attempt to prosecute Hillary Clinton for use of a private e-mail server. \n※It would be a monumental moral mistake to pursue the indictment of Hillary Clinton,§ Jackson said. He said issuing the pardon could help heal the nation, like Ford's pardon of Nixon did. Would Obama pardon Clinton before he leaves office? \n※President Ford said we don't need him for trophy. We need to move on. President Nixon wasn't convicted of a crime. He didn't apply for a pardon. (Ford) did it because he thought it would be best for the country. ※Hillary Clinton has not been tried, but there are those who want to drag her for the next three years. It will not stop until they find a reason to put her in jail. That would be a travesty.§ \nIn 1974, Ford, a University of Michigan alumnus, issued a full and complete pardon of Nixon for any crimes he may have committed. He said the pardon was in the best interests of the nation. \nJackson's comments came at the end of a long day in Ann Arbor, which included him dropping in on an anti-Trump rally held by students on campus. Jesse Jackson: Obama should pardon Hillary Clinton \nJackson comes to a campus that is full of strife over race. Numerous racist flyers have been posted and students have alleged they have been attacked because they are Muslim or a minority. There have been anti-Trump marches on U-M's campus, along with campuses across the nation. A large demonstration marched through a series of U-M buildings even while Jackson was speaking. \nStudents ※are growing up in an America that is in an identity crisis,§ Jackson said. ※These demonstrations are born out of fear. Fear that the Klan will ride again. Fear that violence (against minorities) is coming back. \n※In this election, voters voted for fear. I think hope will defeat hate, but it's a battle.§ In a conversation with the Free Press at the beginning of the day, he blamed Trump for the environment of fear. \nDonald Trump saw an America that was a dry field, and instead of watering it to get the grass growing again, he threw a lit match on it, Jackson said. \nNow it's up to Trump to take action, Jackson added. \n※The one who set the field afire must be the one to put it out,§ he told the Free Press in a one-on-one interview. ※He had the option to pour water on it (the dry field) and let it grow. He didn't do that 〞 he chose to light it on fire. One of my concerns is that we see the division in America now because of that. We see classmates, roommates in a conflict over the way the campaign turned out. \n※He knows Mexicans didn't take jobs from us. It was the corporations. He knows you can't deport 15 million (immigrants). It's not just about the adults, but also about the children who were born here, grew up here and go to school here.§ \nJackson told students not to give up the struggle. \n※Students, don't let them take your hope. Deep water doesn't drown you. You drown because you stop kicking. There is a tug of war for the soul of America. Do we want to be an aristocracy or a democracy? To be silent is to betray your conscience. You must not be silent in the face of violation of human rights.§ source SHARE THIS ARTICLE",

The U.S. House of Representatives re-authorized last week the Iran Sanctions Act , or ISA, for 10 years. The law was first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Iran's energy industry and deter Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons. The Iran measure will expire at the end of 2016 if it is not renewed. The House bill must still be passed by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama to become law. Iran and world powers concluded the nuclear agreement, also known as JCPOA , last year. It imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear program in return for easing sanctions that have badly hurt its economy.

We sure don't. ※The current U.S. government has breached the nuclear deal in many occasions,§ Khamenei said, addressing a gathering of members of the Revolutionary Guards, according to his website. ※The latest is extension of sanctions for 10 years, that if it happens, would surely be against JCPOA, and the Islamic Republic would definitely react to it.§ The U.S. lawmakers passed the bill one week after Republican Donald Trump was elected U.S. president. Republicans in Congress unanimously opposed the agreement, along with about two dozen Democrats, and Trump has also criticized it.

    "text": "Comments \nThe Obama administration has ordered the Pentagon to immediately cease demanding the repayment of enlistment bonuse s from some 10,000 National Guardsmen who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service argued that the soldiers were not qualified to receive the money or that accounting errors had resulted in improper payments, despite many of them having served multiple tours. \nSoldiers from California have been badgering their Congressional representatives about this issue for two years , but Congress has done nothing to alleviate the Pentagon's demands that soldiers repay money they were given years ago and have certainly earned by putting their lives and limbs on the line serving American interests abroad. Some $70 million was spent by overzealous recruiters looking to fill their quotas that the Pentagon is now looking to get back. \n※While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not. About 2,000 have been asked, in keeping with the law, to repay erroneous payments. We're not going to nickel-and-dime them when they get back, and we're not going to hold service members responsible unfairly for unethical conduct or fraud perpetrated by someone else§ said Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. The Obama Administration is now looking to ※fast-track§ the investigations, which have been dragging on for years. \nHowever, the Obama administration is still not bowing to bipartisan pressure from Congress to fully forgive the money. \nIn a statement, Paul Rieckhoff, founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, applauded the move but says more still needs to be done. \n※This is a good step from the Pentagon. But it is long overdue and far from enough. Thousands of lives have been turned upside down and veterans who have served honorably are now in financial ruin through no fault of their own. While it's good for them to know recouping has been halted, that does not make them financially whole or address their urgent needs. Many will be stuck waiting for clarity and the results of the investigation until next year. The Pentagon needs to do more than just halt the recouping, it needs to pay them back每with interest.§ \nThe war against Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) is costing the American taxpayer about $11 million a day . The United States military budget is around $600 billion a year , and the Pentagon has ※lost track§ of some $8 trillion over the past few decades . We can definitely afford to forgive a measly $70 million in order to ensure the financial security of the brave men and women defend our country and our national interests overseas. To hear the Pentagon cry poverty and try to squeeze money out of our National Guardsmen and women after wasting billions of dollars on projects like the defective F-35 joint-strike fighter jet is appalling.",

    "text": "The NRA has just s tated the obvious 每 that President Obama does not have the ability to confiscate guns, nor has he ever tried. This statement is an acknowledgment directly from the NRA, after years of warning their members that a Democratic president is going to take away their guns. This debunks the ludicrous ※Obama conspiracy§ to repeal the Second Amendment and confiscate guns, once and for all. \nThe article was featured in NRA magazine, ※America's 1 st Freedom§ on June 9 th , in which the author admits that ※Congress writes the laws, not the president§ and therefore the president does not have the power to repeal the right to bear arms. The piece was written after the author took issue with Obama's ※rude§ response to a gun store owner named Rhune, on ※gun control,§ which is below as follows: \n※First of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks' guns is just not true. And I don't care how many times the NRA says it,§ declared Obama. \n※I'm about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I've been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true.§ \nThe author's response proves that the NRA has known all along that Dems will not take their guns and now they have publicly admitted it: \n※Congress writes the laws, not the president. He could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms 〞 from Operation Fast and Furious to Operation Choke Point to Obama's attempted ban on common ammunition for AR-15-type rifles to his using a ※pen and phone§ to push anti-gun executive actions. But Rhude respectfully stayed silent.§ \nAlthough neither Clinton or Obama have ever claimed they are going to take away guns from law-abiding gun owners, this has been the NRA's campaign against Democrats for years. The NRA has basically just admitted to blatantly manipulating their members through scare tactics 每 but it hasn't stopped them from reviving this tired old conspiracy theory and applying it to Hillary Clinton, who, for the record, does not want to take your guns. \nIndeed, even in the doubtful scenario that Congress and the president agreed to repeal guns, the Supreme Court would veto this as unconstitutional. NRA members need to acknowledge once and for all that a democratic president is not going to seize their firearms and stop listening to the organization that clearly does not have their best interests in mind.",

He's a former member of a murderous cult , Yahweh ben Yahweh, led by preacher Hulon Mitchell Jr. \nMichael, along with 15 other Yahweh followers, was charged for allegedly conspiring in two murders; his brother, who was also in the cult, told jurors that Michael had helped beat one man who was later killed and stuck a sharpened stick into another man's eyeball. But jurors found Michael (and six other Yahweh followers) innocent. They sent Mitchell away for 20 years in the federal pen. \nMichael later reinvented himself as a radio host and an anti-gay, anti-Obama preacher and soon found himself in the spotlight at Republican events, whose organizers were delighted to have found another person of color to attack Obama without being obviously racist. His website, GODS2.com, is filled with the delusional, vaguely anti-Semitic rantings of a madman, homages to Yahweh, and assertions that . \nThis may not mean much in the long run, but it's worth pointing out just how outrageous the hypocrisy of the Trump campaign is.

This ※investigation§ is over and done with; for Comey to throw fuel on the fire of right-wing paranoia this close to the election cannot be seen as anything but a partisan effort to derail the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, especially after it became clear that Comey tried to suppress news of the investigation into Republican nominee Donald Trump's ties to the Russian Federation 每 a much more serious and potentially seditious allegation. \nWatch the President speak here: ＆We don't operate on innuendo' 〞 President Obama discusses Hillary, emails, and the FBI in an exclusive interview with NowThis pic.twitter.com/0J6tJyEYSh",

    "title": "ObamaCare: Things Fall Apart",
    "text": "Headlined to H3 10/26/16 - Advertisement - \nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, aka \"ObamaCare,\" was intended to dramatically increase the number of Americans with health coverage while \"bending the cost curve\" (that is, reducing the expected increases in price over time). \nThe plan managed the first goal, at least in the short term. Unsurprising, isn't it, that more people get coverage when the law requires them to buy it, penalizes those who won't, and subsidizes those who can't afford to? \nBut the progress on that metric is beginning to disintegrate and we're moving in the other direction. Bloomberg reports that 1.4 million Americans in 32 states will lose the health plans they now have next year as major providers pull out of the ObamaCare \"exchanges\" because they're losing money. Apaprently a business has to take in more than it spends if it wants to remain a going concern. I'm sure I've read that somewhere. \nAs far as \"bending the cost curve\" is concerned ... well ... according to the US Department of Health and Human Services, cited by US News & World Report , average premiums rose by 7.5% last year and will rise by 25% in 2017. Price inflation for most consumer goods over the 2015-2016 period averaged a little more than 1%. Forgive me for thinking that when costs increase at 7-25 times the rate of inflation, that's not really a lot of \"bend\" to the \"curve.\" \nIn 2009, I described (the then notional, yet to be passed into law) ObamaCare as \"[g]overnment feeds you to the insurance companies, while simultaneously feeding the insurance companies to you. The state takes home a doggie bag.\" Which is about the size of it, and I was far from the only person who noticed and warned that the plan not only wouldn't work, but COULDN'T work, if the goal was reducing costs and increasing access to health care. Artificially increasing demand relative to supply can only have the opposite effects. \nSince 2010, Republicans (who, by the way, first proposed the \"individual mandate\" scheme) have slowly but surely retreated from the idea of repealing ObamaCare and replacing it with nothing, instead proposing various schemes for keeping government as involved as possible in health care while pretending to \"return\" it to \"the free market\" (there hasn't been a free market in health care for more than a century, since the American Medical Association got licensing schemes imposed by the states so that it could limit the number of doctors and thereby keep their salaries high). - Advertisement - \nMost Americans are now worse off vis a vis health care than they were six years ago. The only winners have been government health bureaucrats. And unfortunately, the politicians don't seem to be interested in getting out of the way and letting the market fix things. Next stop: \"Single payer.\" - Advertisement -",

    "title": "Putin-Obama trust evaporates",
    "text": "License DMCA \nHow did the \"growing trust\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his \"working and personal relationship with President Obama \" change into today's deep distrust and saber-rattling? \nTheir relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the \"feverish\" state of international relations and lamented: \"My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.\" He complained about \"people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice\" and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a \"common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.\" \nA month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, \"My good friend John Kerry ... is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry's] assurances that the U.S. commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief.\" Do not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire -- not to mention statements at the time by the most senior U.S. generals -- were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia. \nRelations between the U.S. and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft -- including any stealth aircraft -- over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft. - Advertisement - \nIt seems possible that the U.S. air force will challenge that claim in due course -- perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, \"I wouldn't put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft ... if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground.\" \nInjecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia's warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a U.S. or coalition aircraft. \nMeanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the U.S. is contributing \"a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team\" as a \"major sign of the U.S. commitment to strengthening deterrence here.\" \n\"This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,\" he explained, referring to NATO's July summit meeting in the Polish capital. \"The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany.\" \nOn Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the \" myth \" of a \"Russian military threat,\" calling this a \"profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets ... expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders.\" - Advertisement - \nMyth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia's borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against \"saber-rattling ,\" adding that, \"We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation.\" \nSpeaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two and a half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d'e'tat in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia's reaction in annexing Crimea. \nAmericans malnourished on the diet served up by \"mainstream\" media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the U.S. ambassador in Kiev, during which \"Yats\" (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington's choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev. \nThis unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, \"really the most blatant coup in history.",
