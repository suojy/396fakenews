    "text": "Go to Article Dear Abby, I supported a woman I knew had a history of criminal activity, who is married to a rapist and who left 4 men to die in Benghazi. She put our national security at grave risk by leaving top classified emails on her private server, and she took money from nations who throw gays off rooftops and treat women worse than cockroaches. She is likely very sick and would be unlikely to serve out her first term without someone there to prop her up, but nevertheless, I supported her anyhow, because she's a Democrat and has a vagina. Someone told me she still has a chance of winning the presidency if I just signed a petition. They said that Trump really didn't win, because Hillary won the popular vote. Is that true? \nOkay, let's address this ※Hillary might win the popular vote, isn't that Electoral College situation just awful§ thing head on. \nNo, it's not awful. It's great, and it protects the importance of your vote. It's also uniquely American and demonstrates yet again the once-in-creation brilliance of the Founding Fathers. \nFirst of all, she's probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. \nStates don't count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldn't influence the election results, then the absentee ballots aren't counted. \nWho votes by absentee ballot? Students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. The historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 67-33% Republican. In 2000, when Al Gore ※won§ the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone. A 67-33 breakout of those yields a 1.33- to 0.667-million Republican vote advantage, so Bush would have gotten a 667,000-vote margin from California's uncounted absentee ballots alone! So much for Gore's 500,000 popular vote ※victory.§ (That was the headline on the N.Y. Times, and it was the lead story on NBC Nightly News, right? No? You're kidding.) \nGetting back to the ※win the popular vote/lose the Electoral College§ scenario: Thank G-d we have that, or else California and N.Y. would determine every election. Every time. \nBut the Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. Farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. \nShortcomings? Sure. The E.C. can make an R vote meaningless in a very few heavily D states or vice versa. But without the Electoral College, the country's entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states. 每 American Thinker Comment on this Article Via Your Facebook Account Comment on this Article Via Your Disqus Account Follow Us on Facebook!",

The question now is: will the Democrats respect the result, and simply ※Move On,§ as they say? \nOf course, we now know that ＆journalists' like Wolf at CNN were getting their talking points directly the Clinton Campaign . \nAs it turns out, the only thing illegitimate about the 2016 Election＃ was the mainstream corporate media. \nMore form the Guardian＃ \nThe Guardian \nA growing number of academics and activists are calling for US authorities to fully audit or recount the 2016 presidential election vote in key battleground states, in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers. \nThe loose coalition, which is urging Hillary Clinton's campaign to join its fight, is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week, according to two people involved. \nThe document, which is currently 18 pages long, focuses on concerns about the results in the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. \n※I'm interested in verifying the vote,§ said Dr Barbara Simons, an adviser to the US election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting. ※We need to have post-election ballot audits.§ Simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement. \nA second group of analysts, led by the National Voting Rights Institute founder John Bonifaz and Professor Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan's center for computer security and society, is also taking part in the push for a review, and has been in contact with Simons. \nIn a blogpost early on Wednesday, Halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching. \n※Unfortunately, nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now, in the next several days, to petition for recounts,§ he said. \nThe developments follow Clinton's surprise defeat to Donald Trump in the 8 November vote, and come after US intelligence authorities released public assessments that Russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from Democratic officials before the election＃ \nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",

    "title": "The Amish In America Commit Their Vote To Donald Trump; Mathematically Guaranteeing Him A Presidential Victory - ABC News",
    "text": "18 SHARE The Amish in America have committed their vote to Donald Trump guaranteeing him the Presidency. (AP Photo / Dennis System) \nCOLUMBUS, OH (AP) 〞 History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November. \nThe organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee. \nThe Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they don't vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process. \n※Over the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,§ said AAB chairman Menno Simons. ※We have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage. Now, they want to put a woman in the nation's highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 Timothy 2:12. We need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lord's way.§ \nAccording to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote. \n※The Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,§ Silver noted. ※They also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.§ \nThe Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision. \n※I don't believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,§ Clinton wrote to the AAB. ※As a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.§ \nMost pundits believe that Mrs. Clinton's plea is too little too late. \nDuring a press conference in Manhattan, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because ※the Amish do great work for a very low price.§ \nThough Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff over the next two weeks. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses. \n※It looked like she was going to win this election easily,§ said Paul Horner, a campaign worker in Ohio, ※But this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Cleary, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. It's really sad to see the campaign end this way.§ \nIf you are interested in learning more about the Amish community and the AAB, you can contact the Pennsylvania Amish Heritage Museum at (785) 273-0325.

    "text": "64 SHARE President Obama has signed an Executive Order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on December 19th. (AP Photo / Dennis System) \nWASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) 〞 Following the results of Tuesday night's election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19 th . Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. \n※People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,§ Obama told reporters. ※Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.§ \nUnder the President's order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday's election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. \nNot surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the president's decision. \n※Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didn't allow that to happen. President Obama doesn't care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.§ \nThe president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. \n※We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.§ \nPaul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. \n※Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes , but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19 th . What the people are actually voting for are their states' electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.§ \nPolitical Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the President's Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. \n※[The electoral college] is a f〞king joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise . Everyone should have an equal vote, and that's just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. It's time to bring our system into the 21 st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.§ \nObama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. \n※We're going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,§ Obama said. ※Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasn't this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?§ Obama said. ※If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.§ \nIf you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19 th election , you can call the Obama administration's special election hotline at (785) 273-0325.

But we certainly know what Epstein did and, almost as outrageously, what he got away with doing . \n\nSome of the most shocking allegations against Epstein surfaced only after the conclusion of an FBI probe, in civil suits brought by his victims: for example, the claim that three 12-year-old French girls were delivered to him as a birthday present. But the feds did identify roughly 40 young women, most of them underage at the time, who described being lured to Epstein's Palm Beach home on the pretense of giving a \"massage\" for money, then pressured into various sex acts, as well as the \"Balkan sex slave\" Epstein allegedly boasted of purchasing from her family when she was just 14. More recently, a big cash payment from Mail on Sunday coaxed one of Epstein's main accusers out of anonymity to describe what she claims were her years as a teenage sex toy. This victim, Virginia Roberts, produced a photo of herself with Prince Andrew in 2001 and reported that Epstein paid her $15,000 to meet the prince. Then 17 years old, she claims that she was abused by Epstein and \"loaned\" to his friends from the age of 15. \n\nSex crimes of the kind Roberts alleges took place typically carry a term of 10 to 20 years in federal prison. Yet when all was said and done, Epstein served his scant year-plus-one-month in a private wing of the Palm Beach jail and was granted a 16-hour-per-day free pass to leave the premises for work. \n\nIn short, Epstein was never actually in jail. During his \"house arrest,\" he flew around the country on his jets from his New York City place to his private island. At least one of Epstein's victims claimed to have met Bill Clinton. And it turns out that Bill Clinton was a much more regular passenger on the Lolita Express. \n\nFormer President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender's infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the \"Lolita Express\" -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. \n\nClinton's presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein's Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including \"Tatiana.\" The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls. \n\nIt doesn't help that the Democratic establishment seems to have played a role in getting Epstein a pass on child rape, that Bill Clinton already had rape accusations in his past or that the Clintons had become notorious for their willingness to do favors for criminals in exchange for money. \n\nEither way we've come a long way from Gary Hart being bounced for \"Monkey Business\" to Bill Clinton flying around on a child rapist's plane without anyone in the media seeming to care much about it. \n\nSocial conservatives often get a bad rap. But there really is no limit to how low standards can fall when any trace of a moral code vanishes out the window. What did Bill Clinton actually do? Who knows. More importantly these days, who cares \n\nABOUT DANIEL GREENFIELD \n\nDaniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam.\" \n\n\"For sure, defence counsel have made much of Taylor's involvement with the missing and murdered women, all but pointing the finger at her as homicidal maniac, the real killer.

Brenda Wolfe's lipstick, Mona Wilson's rosary. \n\nOne witness, Pickton pal Pat Casanova, told the court he once received fellatio from a woman he knew as \"Angel,\" who'd been brought to the farm by Taylor. He said he gave the money to Taylor, who shared some of it with \"Angel.\" \n\nAnother witness, Gina Houston, put Taylor on the same bed with victim Sereena Abotsway, in Pickton's trailer. \n\nIn his lengthy police interview, Pickton repeatedly tells police he wants to speak with Taylor. \n\nOn the stand, Houston recounted a conversation she'd had with Pickton about Taylor, shortly before his arrest. \n\n\"Willie told me that he believed she (Taylor) would do the right thing when she came back.

It wasn't a cocktail-gown kind of place ,\" he recalled. \n\nBrian, who didn't want his last name used, recalled that there was a coat-check girl and a sign saying, \"Check your knives and other weapons at the door.\" ... \n\nThe crowd at Piggy's Palace often included men wearing Hells Angels biker club colours. \n\n\"They were there a lot,\" said Brian. \"The people who came all seemed to know one another.\"  \n\n\"Super Serco bulldozes ahead  \nBy DAILY MAIL REPORTER UPDATED: 23:00 GMT, 1 September 2004 \nSERCO has come a long way since the 1960s when it ran the 'four-minute warning' system to alert the nation to a ballistic missile attack. \n\nToday its ㏒10.3bn order book is bigger than many countries' defence budgets.

They are an ideal way of developing solutions, procedures and plans rather than the focus being on decision making. Table Top Exercises These involve a realistic scenario and will follow a time line, either in real-time or with time jumps to concentrate on the more important areas. The participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness. Simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise. Table-top exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations. Command/Control Post Exercises These are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping. Ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations and using their communications and information systems [Feeling lucky, Punk?] . This could include a mix of locations and varying levels of technical simulation support. The Gold Standard system is flexible to allow the tempo and intensity to be adjusted to ensure maximum training benefit, or to fully test and evaluate the most important aspects of a plan. Such exercises also test information flow, communications, equipment, procedures, decision making and coordination. Live Exercises These can range from testing individual components of a system or organisation through to a full-scale rehearsal.

In 1989, he won an 18-month exchange with Ernst & Young in London, who employed him after four months.[1] Head hunted in 1994 by Serco , Hyman became European finance director, and in 1999 was made group finance director. In 2002, Hyman became chief executive. .. Hyman resigned from his role of Chief Executive of Serco on 25 October 2013 following allegations that Serco had overcharged government customers. .. He was [making a presentation to Serco shareholder, including British and Saudi governments] on the 47th floor of the World Trade Center [North Tower] at the time of the September 11 attacks in 2001.\" \n\n\"July 7, 2016 Developments in PKI occurred in the early 1970s at the British intelligence agency GCHQ , where James Ellis , Clifford Cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution.[ 19 ] However, as developments at GCHQ are highly classified, the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mid-1990s. \n\nThe public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in 1976 by Diffie, Hellman , Rivest, Shamir , and Adleman changed secure communications entirely. With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting. \n\nAssorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used. With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread, the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute. Commercial reasons alone (e.g., e-commerce, online access to proprietary databases from web browsers) were sufficient. Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol ('https' in Web URLs); it included key establishment, server authentication (prior to v3, one-way only), and so on. A PKI structure was thus created for Web users/sites wishing secure communications. \n\nVendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market, started companies (or new projects at existing companies), and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability. An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations (see ABA digital signature guidelines), and shortly thereafter, several U.S. states (Utah being the first in 1995) and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations. Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others. \n\nThe enacted laws and regulations differed, there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation, and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be. \n\nBy the first few years of the 21st century, the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly. Operating procedures (manual or automatic) were not easy to correctly design (nor even if so designed, to execute perfectly, which the engineering required). The standards that existed were insufficient. \n\nPKI vendors have found a market, but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid-1990s, and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated.[20] PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to, and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others. PKI has had the most success in government implementations; the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program.\"  \n\nBase One Technologies 每 Corporate Strategy 每 We are a Government Certified Women-Owned Business   \nWe practice Diversity Recruitment and Staffing for IT positions Base One was founded in 1994 by a women engineer who had made a career in technology research for many years.

Smartmatic Chairman Mark Malloch-Brown is a former U.N. official and sits on the board of Soros' Open Society Foundations. Since the story first broke, the flow-chart has disappeared from Smartmatic's website, raising further questions about the real status of the Soros-tied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in U.S. elections. \n\nIf Malloch-Brown's Soros ties weren't troubling enough, he also has ties to the Clintons through his work at two consulting firms. \n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the National Association of Secretaries of State, Smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states' have contested that their equipment came from Smartmatic. Why, then, had Smartmatic bragged about providing over 50,000 voting machines for U.S. elections?\" \n\n\"Check http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/309533/opinion/why-have-all-the-digital-signatures-from-the-election-returns-been-stripped \" \n\n\"Electronic voting pad input device, system and method  \nUS 7537159  \nB2 ABSTRACT  \nIn the preferred embodiment, the invention is a data entry device intended for use by voters during an election to enter selected choices.

In a motion filed Thursday in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, prominent Vancouver criminal defence lawyer Ian Donaldson seeks to block police access to sensitive records seized by members of the RCMP and the Co-ordinated Law Enforcement Unit on Aug. 20. \n\nCertain disputed files have been sealed in court pending resolution of the privilege claim. An initial court hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday morning on the search warrant challenge. \n\nHIRING SPREE SEEKS PORN-PEDDLER, OTHERS \n\nIn an unrelated Starnet matter, the Vancouver-based Internet gambling and pornography company appears eager to mount a new hiring spree, recruiting staff in numerous positions, including its porn division, which it hopes to quickly sell off. \n\nIn a large ad on Thursday in The Georgia Straight, a Vancouver weekly entertainment newspaper, Starnet is soliciting a marketing representative for its entertainment division, amongst numerous other posted jobs. \"Do you have the ability to 'think outside the curve'?,\" Starnet asks in its porn-peddler posting. The company states that this position requires strategic thinking and implementation, directly relating to Redlight.com and Adultv.com. \n\nQueasy web-surfers may want to take a pass on these sites, at least Redlight.com, which offers a much harder-core home page than Starnet's main porn sites, Sizzler.com and Chisel.com. Redlight.com's home page offers an extremely explicit mix of \"teaser\" shots, including a graphic live-sex video clip. While Starnet wants to dump its porn business, its latest ad seeks a marketer to maintain continual market research of new forms of advertising and demographics, with \"overall participation in the team effort.\" The Thursday recruitment ad came three days after Starnet's Monday disclosure that it hopes to quickly auction off its adult entertainment division assets, with documentation to be complete in 30 days. \n\nThis Redlight.com site happens to be the same Starnet site targeted by the police in their proposed single criminal count of adult pornography. While no charges have yet been laid against Starnet or any directors or employees, the \"information to obtain,\" a court-filed document supporting the search warrant, notes eight proposed counts, including one of possession, for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation, computerized pictures depicting obscene acts. The police note that \"Fetish,\" one of Redlight.com's seven sections, shows 84 images of nude bondage, women with clamps on body parts, women with horse bridles and bits in their mouths, and women hanging by their arms from straps or belts. \n\nThe latest Starnet recruitment ad also suggests it is \"business as usual\" at Starnet, despite the week-ago raid by more than 100 officers from the RCMP, CLEU, the Ontario Provincial Police, the United States Customs Service and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. \n\nThe Georgia Straight ad seeks a WorldBroadcasts.com manager, an Internet marketing manager, HTML programmers, graphic designers, an investor relations administrative assistant, an adminstrative assistant of production and sports odds analysts. Starnet seeks \"open-minded, innovative people who enjoy working in a dynamic, fun, team atmosphere and are able to work creatively under pressure.\" \n\n\"BREAKING: @HillaryClinton's E-Mail Server Company Got Almost $1 Million In Gov't Loans After Wiping E-Mails   \nOCTOBER 26, 2016  \nBY CHARLES C. JOHNSON 6 COMMENTS  \nGive it up already. It's over. K. J. Gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story. \n\nHillary Clinton's e-mail server company got almost $1 million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe Hillary Clinton's name from her e-mails. \n\nPlatte River Networks (PRN) got a $493,000 loan from the Small Business Administration in August 2014 and another $350,000 loan in September 2015: \n\nPublic government data available as USAspending.gov \n\nThe first half-million dollar loan arrived not one month after PRN employee Paul Combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at Hillary's request in July 2014 . \n\nThe second $350,000 loan came about one year later. \n\nYou won't hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media. Keep the GotNews mission alive: donate at GotNews.com/donate or send tips to editor@gotnews.com.

The head of the Small Business Administration is Maria Contreras-Sweet , a Mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by Barack Obama two months before Hillary's PRN got the first loan. \n\nWikiLeaks leaks have proven Hillary's corrupt pay-to-play scheme. GotNews has shined a light on how Hillary gets favors from Hispanic and Democratic government bureaucrats before . \n\nDid Hillary Clinton pay her e-mail server company Platte River Networks (PRN) with almost $1 million in favorable government loans 〞 given out by a political friendly 〞 in order to alter her illegal e-mails and get her name off them? \n\nIt sure looks like it. \n\nA Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request has been lodged for more information. \n\nStay tuned for more. \n\nK.

They entered the company offices and homes of some directors on Friday. \n\nPolice were looking for evidence of illegal gambling, distributing child pornography, and money laundering. Since the raid, Starnet officials say police just don't understand their business. \n\nThe search warrant details 18 months of police investigation. It traces a network of companies registered in American and Caribbean jurisdictions. \n\nThe warrant also identifies Vancouver as the centre of Starnet's operations, even though this is a grey under Canadian law. \n\nPolice note that Starnet's revenues grew dramatically in the past two years, from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software. The investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for Friday's raid and seizure of company materials. \n\nRCMP Constable Peter Thiessen says investigators left Starnet offices yesterday morning. He says, \"They spent the better part of three days going through the business. And as a result of that search the investigation is continuing, but no charges have been laid.\" Starnet's many investors were spooked by the raid. Share prices dropped almost 70-percent on Friday. However, the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation. Stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading. \n\nIn written statements, company CEO Mark Dohlen said the Wall Street Journal calls Starnet the leader in Internet gaming and entertainment. He says companies like his, those on the cutting edge, are often misunderstood. Yesterday, Starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business. It plans to focus more resources on gaming. \n\nThe Police investigation is expected to last for several more months.\" \n\n\"Super Serco bulldozes ahead  \nBy DAILY MAIL REPORTER UPDATED: 23:00 GMT, 1 September 2004 \nSERCO has come a long way since the 1960s when it ran the 'four-minute warning' system to alert the nation to a ballistic missile attack. \n\nToday its ㏒10.3bn order book is bigger than many countries' defence budgets.

In 1989, he won an 18-month exchange with Ernst & Young in London, who employed him after four months.[1] Head hunted in 1994 by Serco , Hyman became European finance director, and in 1999 was made group finance director. In 2002, Hyman became chief executive. .. Hyman resigned from his role of Chief Executive of Serco on 25 October 2013 following allegations that Serco had overcharged government customers. .. He was [making a presentation to Serco shareholder, including British and Saudi governments] on the 47th floor of the World Trade Center [North Tower] at the time of the September 11 attacks in 2001.\" \n\n\"July 7, 2016 Developments in PKI occurred in the early 1970s at the British intelligence agency GCHQ , where James Ellis , Clifford Cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution.[ 19 ] However, as developments at GCHQ are highly classified, the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mid-1990s. \n\nThe public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in 1976 by Diffie, Hellman , Rivest, Shamir , and Adleman changed secure communications entirely. With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting. \n\nAssorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used. With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread, the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute. Commercial reasons alone (e.g., e-commerce, online access to proprietary databases from web browsers) were sufficient. Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol ('https' in Web URLs); it included key establishment, server authentication (prior to v3, one-way only), and so on. A PKI structure was thus created for Web users/sites wishing secure communications. \n\nVendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market, started companies (or new projects at existing companies), and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability. An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations (see ABA digital signature guidelines), and shortly thereafter, several U.S. states (Utah being the first in 1995) and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations. Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others. \n\nThe enacted laws and regulations differed, there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation, and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be. \n\nBy the first few years of the 21st century, the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly. Operating procedures (manual or automatic) were not easy to correctly design (nor even if so designed, to execute perfectly, which the engineering required). The standards that existed were insufficient. \n\nPKI vendors have found a market, but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid-1990s, and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated.[20] PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to, and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others. PKI has had the most success in government implementations; the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program.\"  \n\nBase One Technologies 每 Corporate Strategy 每 We are a Government Certified Women-Owned Business   \nWe practice Diversity Recruitment and Staffing for IT positions Base One was founded in 1994 by a women engineer who had made a career in technology research for many years.

Please Read: thinkprogress.org... Patriot Majority alleges the investigation and raid were political moves, and that Lawson worked closely with Gov. Mike Pence (R), who has pushed the ※voter fraud§ conspiracy on the campaign trail alongside Donald Trump. ※We've seen nothing but partisan activity from the secretary of state, and even from the police,§ Buck said. ※They saw that there was a very successful voter registration drive happening, and this was an attempt to shut it down.§ ※It's clear that the governor or the governor's staff are very aware and involved in what's happening,§ he continued. ※It fits into the Trump/Pence narrative that in certain neighborhoods, you have to watch how many times people show up to vote and how things happen.§ If this situation is Not fully clarified in the following hours we could see in the General election how Trump will probably take Indiana with a really small margin of votes by blocking these voters to be able to express their decision freely. All this operation of today is part of carefully designed Republican strategy to use the excuse of a possible fraud to justify arbitrary measures that will prevent many Americans to elect the next President, is a political boycott of the General Election. Please check: theintercept.com... This is an Red Alert to all voters that oppose Donald Trump to watch carefully the behavior and decisions taken by the Republican governors to try to favor their Candidate. ※They saw that there was a very successful voter registration drive happening, and this was an attempt to shut it down.§ Please check: www.dailykos.com... The thread is open not only to discuss this so dark operation but also to invite other members of ATS community to report irregularities of any kind that are right now taking place to assure that on November who become elected will be President not because it has really the support of the majority but because thousands of Americans are going to be deprived of their right to vote. Voter registration drives across the country follow similar protocol, without being subject to investigations. A Huffington Post investigation reported that ※it seems the extraordinary investigation is likely to find no more than potential technical violations of obscure regulations for third-party voter registration groups.§ Thanks for your attention,",

    "text": "link originally posted by: JinMI Lots of discussion over the past months. Who we're for or who we're against and platitudes of statements...some not so much. Whomever you decide to give your vote to honestly does not concern me nor should mine concern you. The debates, arguments and discussions are fun and generally informative. Vote for who you would, even if it takes a few hours. I've seen quite a bit of conversation of folks not wanting to vote at all. What does this prove? What is this standing (sitting) against? Your disapproval of the two party system or maybe you think the whole thing a charade? My opinion would leave me to believe that if your going to attempt to rebel against the system it would be a secure third party vote or a vote for the future so to speak. We as Americans need to take back our power over Government. There is more than just the Presidency at stake and to me I would think that not voting at all is a contribution to the apathy that has us in the situation we are in. Whether it be Trump or Drumf or Hillary or Shillary or Stein or Johnson or Joe Blow, I would urge you to vote! If you are not voting at all, would you please elaborate as to why? I'm trying to imagine the next president of the USA being Joe Blow. Well now President Blow, what do you think of the Cannabis trade with Mexico? Anything to declare?",

    "text": "on October 27, 2016 2:53 am ﹞ \nConservatives claim that voter ID is necessary to catch illegal voters, but it turns out they're the only ones creating fake IDs to use on Election Day. \nTrump supporters are taking Trump's call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake ID badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them, confusing them, and filming them 〞 all of which are illegal. \nBut, Trump's deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a right-wing group known as ※Vote Protectors.§ \nThe group, which is affiliated with top Trump ally Roger Stone, is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on Election Day. They are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes. \nAccording to the Huffington Post , \nStone's group created an official-looking ID badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake ※exit polls,§ efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. Or at least that's what the group was planning to do before The Huffington Post asked Stone about it on Tuesday. The controversial Trump ally, long known for his bare-knuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his group's websites were there without his knowledge, and assured HuffPost that he would operate within the confines of election law. \nIn fact, after HuffPo confronted Stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that Vote Protectors had a ※bad idea§ and ※ordered them taken down.§ \nCampaign Legal Center deputy director Danielle Lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. \n※It's inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy,§ she told HuffPo in reference to the videotaping. ※When that's being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. Objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it.§ \nIndeed, but that's exactly what Donald Trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him. \nAs it turns out, he's right about the election being rigged, only it's conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of Trump. \nEarlier this week, a Wisconsin city clerk in Green Bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she has merely heard that students lean Democrat. \n※I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,§ Republican appointed clerk Kris Teske wrote. \n※UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn't going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats.§ \nSo not only are Trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well. \nAnd that is likely going to cause a lot of Election Day chaos. Voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what Trump's deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it. \nFeatured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Share this Article!",

    "title": "Trump Supporters Didn't Vote Because Of The Economy; It Was Racism, And Here's PROOF",
    "text": "on November 13, 2016 4:03 pm ﹞ \nPost election, the media and Donald Trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. They are making the claim that Trump wasn't elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that it's simply not true. Trump voters are racist and there's proof. \nThe American National Elections Study (ANES) began the study in January. Initially, they asked ※How likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.§ Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. It's VERY unlikely that whites aren't getting jobs because minorities are, but that's not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that it's ※extremely likely§ that minorities are taking jobs from white people. Graph courtesy of ANES and Salon . \nThen, they asked the same Trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. Despite the fact that trade was one of Trump's signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed. \nPost election, this is what the study found: \nThe question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is ※extremely likely§ that whites can't find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is ※not at all§ likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eighty-one percent of white women who think it is ※extremely likely§ people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who don't think that. \nMore than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are ※violent.§ 84 percent think that of Muslims. \nUnfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this: \nDemocrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As I've shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation. \nGreat idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots' claims go unchallenged. \nFeatured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images Share this Article!

    "text": "WHAT? Some Cities Are Now Pushing For Noncitizen Immigrants TO VOTE shares \nEvery time Donald Trump suggests the election could be rigged in some way, Democrats and their many media allies scoff and laugh, then accuse Trump of promoting conspiracy theories. \nAt the same time, the left is trying to steal the election in broad daylight. \nBloomberg reports: \nSome Cities Want Their Noncitizen Immigrants to Vote \n※Look at illegal immigrants voting all over the country,§ Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election. There's no evidence to support the Republican nominee's claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include noncitizens. \nThe latest is San Francisco, where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city's public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. ※One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn't have a voice,§ says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. ※We've had legal immigrants who've had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.§ Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the ※broken immigration system in this country.§ \nNoncitizen voting isn't as radical as it might sound. For more than half of U.S. history, from 1776 until the 1920s, noncitizens were widely permitted to participate in elections. ※We had 40 states that used to allow it,§ says Ron Hayduk, an associate professor of political science at San Francisco State University. ※Immigrants could vote, not just in local elections,§ he says. ※They could even run for office〞and did win office.§ The hope, Hayduk says, was that immigrants would feel more invested in civic life if they were able to participate in American democracy. \nDo you think Democrats would want non-citizens to vote if they tended to vote Republican? \nOf course not. \nThe Democrat party is a criminal enterprise and they'll do whatever they have to do to win. shares",

    "text": "Loading Posted on November 2, 2016 This Professor Devotes Her Life to Countering Dangerous Speech. She Can't Ignore Donald Trump's. Colby Itkowitz, Washington Post, October 24, 2016 \nWhen Susan Benesch began looking at how speech could incite mass violence, her research took her to far-flung places like Kenya and Burma. \nLately, she's been unable to ignore a case study at home in the United States. \nThe American University law professor and Harvard University faculty associate has grappled for months with whether Donald Trump's rhetoric constitutes dangerous speech as she has come to define it. She has examined election-year speech before, but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great. \nBut in the past week, with Trump claiming that the election system and the media are rigged against him, his messages have the type of undertone that increases the risk of violence between groups, she said. \nBenesch, 52, has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech. To rise to that level, at least two of these five indicators must be true: A powerful speaker with a high degree of influence over the audience. The audience has grievances and fears that the speaker can cultivate. A speech act that is clearly understood as a call to violence. A social or historical context that is propitious for violence, for any of a variety of reasons, including long-standing competition between groups for resources, lack of efforts to solve grievances or previous episodes of violence. A means of dissemination that is influential in itself, for example because it is the sole or primary source of news for the relevan t audience. \n※Trump's speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it,§ Benesch said in a recent interview. ※The meaning is so often ambiguous.§ \nBut when Trump said his supporters could use the Second Amendment against Hillary Clinton, ※it seems to me impossible that people didn't understand that as a reference to violence,§ she said. Or when he suggested that Clinton and President Obama were founders of the Islamic State, something he alluded to again at Wednesday's final debate, that was a ※hallmark of dangerous speech to describe an in-group member as the enemy,§ she said. \nAnd now, with Trump trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him, he's definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting. Direct incitement of violence is illegal, but Trump falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience. \nBecause of that, it's still a gray area that surrounds whether Trump does use dangerous speech. \n※Trump may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of U.S. democracy,§ Benesch said. ※Some of them每those who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messages每may therefore be more likely to commit violence. However, the United States is not in danger of mass intergroup violence, in my view. It is deeply irresponsible, though, since it can undermine some Americans' belief in our own democratic institutions, which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward.§ \n{snip}",

    "title": "How Hillary Courts the Black Vote",
    "text": "Posted on November 6, 2016 How Hillary Courts the Black Vote Ethnomasochism reaches a new low. \nThe Democratic presidential primary was one of unprecedented pandering for the non-white vote. As The Guardian summed up one of the debates: ※Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders made a conspicuous play for Latino and African American voters.§ Mrs. Clinton won the ※conspicuous play§ hands down, and with it, the nomination. The failure of Senator Sanders to win the necessary quotient of non-white votes was repeatedly pointed out by the chattering class up until the time he dropped out. \nIn February one black commenter pointedly wrote that Sen. Sanders, ※has many miles to go to convince black voters that he can fight for our interests.§ By May, black commenter Steven Thrasher wrote a piece titled, ※ Bernie Sanders isn't winning minority votes 每 and it's his own fault .§ Mr. Thrasher identified Sen. Sanders's problem as ※failing to talk about racism at every turn.§ \nThis accusation may seem ludicrous, since Sen. Sanders surrendered his stage to Black Lives Matter activists several times. But in comparison to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Thrasher was right about Sen. Sanders. No mainstream candidate in the history of the United States has more thoroughly debased himself in the quest for the black vote than Mrs. Clinton. Since this helped her win the Democratic nomination, she has continued the strategy. In the few days remaining before November 8th, let's take a look at Hillary Clinton's most ethnomasochistic moments. \n1) In January of 2016, Mrs. Clinton was at something called the Iowa Brown and Black Forum (with none other than Jorge Ramos ), where she was asked ※Can you tell us what the term ＆white privilege' means to you? And can you give me an example from your life or career when you think you have benefitted from it?§ This is how she began her answer: \nWhere do I start? I think it is hard when you are swimming in the ocean to know exactly what is happening around you so much as it is when you're standing on the shore perhaps watching . . . . I was born white, middle-class, in the middle of America. . . . \n2) Early in the Democratic nomination, Mrs. Clinton's campaign released a memo aimed at stifling the rising momentum of Bernie Sanders: \n[W]hereas the electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire are largely rural/suburban and predominantly white, the March [primary] states better reflect the true diversity of the Democratic Party and the nation . . . . It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among African American and Hispanic voters. We believe that's how it should be. emphasis added \n3) Shortly before the South Carolina primary, at Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, Mrs. Clinton explained how to break down barriers for African Americans: \nEnding systemic racism requires contributions from all of us〞especially those of us who haven't experienced it ourselves. White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day. \nWe need to recognize our privilege and practice humility, rather than assume that our experiences are everyone's experiences. All of us need to bring our skills to bear〞and especially young people coming up today, who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems. \n4) In April of 2016, while on a back radio show, Mrs. Clinton was asked what she always carries in her bag. She immediately answered, ※hot sauce.§ When one of the black hosts noted that she would be accused of pandering to black people for giving that answer, she asked hopeully, ※Is it working?§ \n5) Just a few weeks after a Black Lives Matter supporter murdered five police officers , the Democratic National Convention that convened to nominate Mrs. Clinton passed a resolution, no doubt with her approval, supporting Black Lives Matter : \n[T]he DNC joins with Americans across the country in affirming ＆Black lives matter' and the ＆say her name' efforts to make visible the pain of our fellow and sister Americans as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed African American men, women and children. \nWhite politicians have tried to win elections through public displays of ethnomasochism for decades, but this election has set a new low. And if Mrs. Clinton loses, her pandering could live on in another form. As the Black Lives Matter activist Tef Poe explained , if Mr. Trump wins, ※young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go . . . ain't no more rules. We've been too nice as is.§",

    "title": "Who Gains From Colombia's Vote for Permanent War?",
    "text": "Share This \nIn early October, the Colombian people voted NO to peace. \nOr to be exact, 50.2 percent of 37 percent of the eligible population voted no. In the referendum held on October 2, the majority of voters decided to scuttle the agreement between the government and FARC rebels, which had been reached after four years of peace talks dedicated to ending 52 years of bloodshed. \nThe vote came just days after the celebratory signing of the agreement, which was lauded in the international community for achieving a bridge between historic enemies and dealing broadly with the root causes of the conflict. The rest of the world was stunned. \nMost pundits have begun the post-mortem analysis of the referendum by saying something like ※Colombians did not vote against peace.§ They go on to discuss other factors, including people's ignorance of the accords, or their mistaken belief that after four years it could simply be renegotiated. \nBut the fact of the matter is that the NO voters voted clearly and unambiguously to continue the war. The words on the ballot read: ※Do you accept the final agreement to terminate the conflict and build a stable and lasting peace?§ It's almost inconceivable that any population would vote no on this proposition, but they did. \nSo why did they? \nAlthough even former president Alvaro Uribe, the nation's leading warmonger, now makes the politically correct statement that the ultimate goal is peace, the macho sentiments of total domination and punishment (of one side), along with a strong dose of Cold War hysteria (yes, in the 21 st century) won the day. \nThe NO promoters knew what they were doing. They were not promoting an alternative peace. As a 32-year old NO voter quoted in the New York Times put it, ※If ＆no' wins, we won't have peace, but at least we won't give the country away to the guerrillas.§ \nHis statement reflects the patriarchal logic that has started and perpetuated wars since time immemorial 每 the only good enemy is a dead enemy, and if I don't win, nobody wins. \nAt least some NO voters and many of the leaders are betting on continuing war until they gain by force their entire military and political agenda 每 a prospect that, given the war's longevity to date could easily be another half century. Or never. \nThe Perks of Permanent War \nFor many NO promoters, including Uribe himself, ※never§ could be the best-case scenario. Basking in the limelight of a political career rebuilt on the ruins of one the most complex and progressive peace agreements in history, Uribe released proposals for revamping the peace agreement designed to throw a monkey wrench into any process to salvage peace in Colombia. \nAnalysts quoted on CNN's Spanish channel observed that Uribe's wish list is aimed at ※torpedoing the peace accords.§ That's correct: No one expects the FARC to accept Uribe's terms, which include banning the group from politics, sentencing members to 5-8 year prison terms for crimes including drug trafficking, pardoning Colombia's security forces for their own serious crimes, and eliminating the meticulously negotiated Tribunal for Transitional Justice. \nHuge sectors of the population reject Uribe's terms as well, since his proposals would also wipe out the parts of the peace accord that regulate the return of stolen lands to peasant and indigenous communities and seriously hamper, if not strike altogether, plans for reparations to victims. They also could rollback meticulously negotiated gains in gender justice and LGBT rights. \nTo pretend that everyone wants peace and the only issue is how to get it is to ignore the fact that the war benefits many powerful interests. Those interests will fight to keep fighting. \nOn the political front, war assures military control over a population and justifies authoritarianism and repression through fear. In general, the most militarized parts of the country are areas where peasants, Afro-Colombians, and indigenous peoples are defending their lands and resources from the incursions of transnational corporations and mega development projects. Fear and murder are powerful repressive tools. \nWar is also a huge business. Thanks to U.S. Plan Colombia and policies that fanned the conflict, Colombia became the third largest recipient of US aid in the world during the war, behind only Israel and Egypt. Colombia's budget for security forces skyrocketed ; between 2001 and 2005, it grew more than 30 percent, and by 2006 it was double its 1990 levels 每 some $4.48 billion for military and police. \nUS Interests \nThe US military-industrial complex also has a vested interest in continuing the war. The conflict justified Plan Colombia, the $10 billion dollar counterinsurgency and counternarcotics plan that allowed the Pentagon to establish a military presence in Colombia, both physically and by proxy. With the pretext of Colombia's internal conflict, the US government built up a platform not only for control in Colombia, but also for regional strike capacity, as leaked in the proposed agreement to establish seven US military bases. \nPlan Colombia and its later incarnations kept US contracts for weapons, espionage, intelligence equipment, and military and police training flowing to the most powerful lobbying industries in the nation. Billions of dollars have been poured into Plan Colombia and national security investments that ended up in the pockets of political elites and US defense companies. In the budgets for fiscal years 2010-2017, the United States allocated over $2 billion in military and police aid 每 most of that during the peace talks. \nIn the process, Colombia was converted into a testing ground for the latest in counterinsurgency and unconventional warfare techniques and equipment from the United States. The blood spilled on its soil feeds the global war machine, to such an extent that Colombia has been groomed as an exporter of counterinsurgency and ※security§ training, despite its reputation as a gross violator of human rights and the disastrous humanitarian impact of its prolonged war. Colombian forces now work throughout the region to promote the same counternarcotics-counterinsurgency model that left more than 5 million people displaced and untold thousands of innocent peasants executed by security forces. \nSo very powerful interests saw the peace agreement as a threat. In addition to Uribe followers who viewed it as soft on the FARC, the war economy of the nation and its ally, the United States, was at stake. \nIn this context, the US government reacted tepidly when peace was voted down. Bernard Aronson, the special envoy to the peace talks, expressed no regret in a press interview after the vote, stating, ※We believe Colombians want peace, but clearly they are divided about terms of settlement.§ The State Department limited its statement to support for Colombian democracy and further dialogue. After four years of ostensibly supporting the peace talks, neither mentioned the vote as a setback. \nAn analysis published by the US Army War College, although it is not an official document, openly expresses relief at the continuation of indefinite war in Colombia. Through a mixture of hawkish arguments and lies , the analysis recognizes that the country now enters into a ※period of uncertainty,§ but notes that this ※presents a strategic situation less grave and more manageable, than had the accords been approved.§ \nIt goes on to predict that the FARC will likely break the ceasefire, despite the group's explicit and public commitment to respect it even in the absence of the guarantees provided in the peace agreement. This position 每 coming from sources close to the US military, which has in many senses called the shots in Colombia's war since Plan Colombia began in 2000 每 indicates that there is a dangerous possibility of a provocation to further undermine the peace process that has now been thrown into crisis by the NO vote. \nThe writers also advise President Juan Santos, who staked his political capital on supporting the deal, to retract his commitment to the ceasefire following the vote. They note that Santos promised to ※not authorize military operations in the areas where FARC units are located in order to avoid an incident which breaks the fragile truce. Yet not doing so will allow FARC dissidents to operate with almost complete impunity in these areas. Indeed, within the new background of uncertainty, such impunity will increase incentives for FARC units to continue illicit activity, such as drug trafficking, since doing so will pose relatively low risks.§ \nWar Engenders More War, Not Peace \nBefore the NO vote, the US press hailed Plan Colombia for making peace possible. President Obama, in his self-congratulatory last speech to the UN, proclaimed that we ※helped Colombia end Latin America's longest war.§ The logic of this bizarre argument went that were it not for the military debilitation of the guerrillas thanks to the U.S.-Colombian military alliance, the FARC could never have been brought to the negotiating table. \nThe NO vote is the classic example of the fallacy of that logic. The war fomented by Plan Colombia built up a mentality that made peace an unacceptable solution for many. It revealed the fundamental clash of perspectives between diplomacy and annihilation. \nThe lesson couldn't be clearer: War is a terrible preparation for peace. Peace depends on much more than a favorable correlation of forces. Peace, at its core, is a rejection of force as the way to confront differences, and a search for nonviolent solutions to conflict and conflict prevention. \nWith US military theorists openly calling for reopening hostilities, it is a dangerous myth to assume that at this juncture everyone wants peace and the only open question is how to do it. Plan Colombia, the U.S.-sponsored war on drugs, and Uribe's ※Democratic Security§ policy all posit continued militarization. Those who promote peace and reconciliation in the country must deal with that mentality head on. To second-guess or justify NO voters with ※they-know-not-what-they-do§ arguments reflects the kind of complacency and misreading of the public that created this dangerous debacle in the first place. \nThere is no doubt that a massive campaign of misinformation and scaremongering played a role. Voters were bombarded with alarmist messages that spun out wild scenarios, from a legislative takeover by the former FARC to a ※Chavez-Castro style dictatorship.§ CNN's footage of the NO celebration showed the crowd chanting ※The NO won, now we won't have a Cuban dictatorship.§ It didn't seem to matter that there was no logical relationship between voting for the peace agreement and the nation becoming a dictatorship. \nFor followers of Uribe, who led the massive campaign against the negotiations and the acceptance of the agreement, the vote was ideological and personal. It represented the right against the left, and Uribe against Santos. For many people stuck in bitter partisan politics, to vote for peace was to vote in favor of the latter. \nIt is also likely that many people did not have a clear understanding of the accords or their implications, which is a failing of the negotiators and SI (yes) promoters that left a fatal opening for NO propaganda. Some voters also apparently believed that four years of arduous negotiations with the technical support of scores of international experts and mediators could simply be reopened and ※fixed§ to their liking, though Santos made it clear there was ※no Plan B.§ Some NO voters quoted in the press even expressed dismay that they had won, believing they were merely casting a protest vote. \nDespite these factors, the NO vote reveals a major obstacle: Society has been trained over years of conflict 每 one of the longest-running internal conflicts in the world 每 to acquiesce to war as the only response, to dehumanize the enemy and overlook the obvious fact that it takes two sides to sustain hostilities. It's created a society that believes the only solution is to drive the enemy into the ground 每 even when they are men and women from one's own country and their grievances reflect serious social problems. \nThis is the patriarchal mentality that the war industry thrives on. Plan Colombia has fomented this mentality since it began. It conflated a war on drugs with a counterinsurgency war to justify foreign intervention and broaden the war. The US government knew that military funding was going directly to paramilitary groups. A 2010 empirical study demonstrated a measurable relationship between increases in US security funding and paramilitary homicides. War propaganda presented the FARC as the sole culprit, when terrible atrocities were being committed on both sides. \nWith the exceptions of Arauca and Norte de Santander, the departments on Colombia's borders that have suffered most in the war voted to end it. They know what it's like to feel their houses shaken by bombs, to risk life and limb walking through minefields, to lose their loved ones in crossfire. They know that to stop the violence in their day-to-day lives is far more important than the political games of how punishment and power are dished out. \nWar as a policy is almost always favored by those farthest from the battlefields. \nThe Road to Peace \nUnderstanding the very real and perilous obstacles is not the same as being pessimistic or defeatist at this point in the Colombian peace process 每 it's a process, after all. It's important not to minimize the enormity of this setback 每 President Santos' Nobel Peace Prize may be deserved, but it's a sorry consolation prize for having gotten so close only to be slapped down. But it's also important to acknowledge that there is still room to move forward. \nThe peace accords opened up a dialogue and allowed the nation to envision peace. Grassroots organizations are mobilizing in defense of this vision and the possibility of a new reality. \nThis is the hope on the horizon. Since the NO vote, thousands have marched to support the peace process in Bogota, and also in Cali and cities across the country. The marches have awakened and united groups of indigenous peoples, Afro-Colombians, victims, students, human rights defenders, peasants, women, and the LGBT community in defense of peace. \nThe international community should openly and actively support the call for a broad grassroots dialogue for peace. It must continue to be firm and vigilant, because there will be a serious attempt to force a return to the model of military annihilation of the left-wing guerrillas while leaving right-wing paramilitaries and other militarist structures intact. \nInternational organizations committed millions of dollars to support peace implementation, and it must be clear that those funds will only be released when the process is back on track. Part of creating adequate conditions is to deny any new funding to militarism 每 including the war on drugs, which acts as a thinly veiled excuse for militarization. \nThe NO vote unexpectedly flipped the political situation back in favor of the right-wing hawks. This uprising could not only flip it back in favor of peace, but also create a social movement capable of going beyond the accords in terms of establishing social justice and human rights and addressing the enormous backlog of demands from below. \nForeign Policy In Focus columnist Laura Carlsen heads the Center for International Policy's Americas Project.

Even then, they offered no details on potential locations, saying al-Qaeda and its affiliates are eager to regain their relevance. \nA NYPD spokesman briefed on the matter said that the threats ※ lack specificity ,§ however local police around the country were said to have been warned that polling places are considered ※attractive targets§ for both organized and homegrown terror attacks. \nOf course, saying that any upcoming event is a potential ※attractive target§ is not unusual these days, and hardly a significant holiday goes by in the US where warnings and briefings about potential attacks are not heavily publicized. \nThe Monday warning offers some unusual details, however, as generally one would think the day of the election itself would be the target, when more people are queuing up for the vote. An attack the day before the election would, however, cast a rather dramatic pall over the entire matter. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",

    "text": "Email \n\nA Saudi prince has urged Americans not to vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming general election. He practically beggs the people to give their votes for Hillary Clinton. For us, this is a HUGE reason NOT TO VOTE FOR HILLARY! She got $50 million from this man. I guess you know what am I talking about. Do not let their cooperation continue, because it is going to end up bad for America. Lets choose a true patriot and see where would our country go! I am sure it is going to be much better than crooked Hillary's road. \nTurki al-Faisal, who served as Saudia Arabia's ambassador to the US from 2005 to 2007, spoke against the presumptive Republican nominee during a foreign policy dinner in Washington, DC on Thursday. \nHe blasted Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, which the billionaire first formulated in December last year before renewing his vow on Wednesday. \n＆For the life of me, I cannot believe that a country like the United States can afford to have someone as president who simply says, ※These people are not going to be allowed to come to the United States,§' Turki said according to the Huffington Post. \n＆It's up to you, it's not up to me,' Turki added. ＆I just hope you, as American citizens, will make the right choice in November.' \nThe gulf nations represent three of the largest donors to the foundation, but that is hardly the extent of their ties to the Clintons. Qatari, UAE, and Saudi firms paid Bill Clinton millions of dollars for speeches during the time Hillary served as secretary of state, when she also approved weapons deals with all three countries worth billions of dollars to U.S. defense firms, many of which are also Clinton Foundation donors. \nBill Clinton has praised the Qataris as ※intelligent, forward looking§ investment partners for their collaboration on Clinton Foundation projects. One of Hillary's top advisers, Cheryl Mills, served on the board of the New York \nUniversity campus in Abu Dhabi. Bill Clinton is the friend and former classmate of Saudi Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, who recently attended a lavish Clinton Foundation conference in Marrakech, hosted by the King of Morocco. The Bill Clinton presidential library in Little Rock was funded in part by a $10 million from the Saudi Royal family. \nTurk, who went to Georgetown University in Washington, DC, isn't currently part of Saudia Arabia's government but serves as the chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, a cultural organization that conducts research in politics, sociology and heritage.",

    "title": "KANSAS: Republican Mailer asks voters ※Have you met the new neighbors?§ (your ＆Muslim terrorist' neighbors)",
    "text": "KANSAS: Republican Mailer asks voters ※Have you met the new neighbors?§ (your ＆Muslim terrorist' neighbors) The Kansas Republican Party is sending out mailers in legislative races around the state depicting ISIS fighters and explosions from MUSLIM terrorist attacks. A mailer going to homes in east Wichita's House District 88 shows an ISIS fighter holding a machine gun with a message that reads: ※Have you met the new neighbors?§ Wichita Eagle The other side of the mailer touts Republican Rep. Joseph Scapa's support for funding to train Kansas law enforcement officers to ※recognize and deal with foreign and domestic threats to our state, from those who support ideologies that are in conflict with the U.S. Constitution and our Kansas values.§ Clay Barker, executive director of the Kansas Republican Party, said similar mailers are being sent out around the state. ※We did polling and focus groups, and the one issue that got overwhelming positive response and was associated with Republicans was safety,§ Barker said. ※You know, Gitmo, that article that came out back in August that ISIS had named soldiers for assassinations, police being shot and those knuckleheads in Garden City, it all kind of added up to a security issue ＃ the whole feeling that's there violence out there. And it's a positive issue for Republicans.§ The Republican mailer specifically depicts ISIS, the Islamic terror group that controls parts of Syria and Iraq. Robert McCraw, director of government affairs for the designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) in Washington, D.C., called the mailers ※a shameful example of scare mongering tactics that I hope the Republican Party can learn to move away from.§ He said it was appalling for the state party ※to falsely insinuate that the state's Muslim population is linked to terror groups like ISIS.§ ※This flier verges on incitement of violence to Muslims.§ The Republican-controlled Legislature has passed resolutions opposing the possible transfer of Guantanamo detainees to Fort Leavenworth. Barker said there are several variations of the mailers. One depicts an explosion from a terrorist attack. ※It's one of the few (issues) that was a clear, like high 80 percent positive and associated with Republicans,§ Barker said. It's not only Republicans who don't want Gitmo terrorists in Kansas Barker also said the party is sending out mailers highlighting Republicans' support for ousting four of the sitting Kansas Supreme Court justices, portraying Democrats who support retaining the justices as soft on crime. Rep. Joseph Scapa, who said he saw the mailer before it was sent out, focused his comments about the mailer more on Muslim refugees, who he says pose a potential security threat. ※We have people coming into our state from parts of the world who believe in ideologies that are incompatible with the United States Constitution and our Kansas values and that poses a threat,§ Scapa said. ※We know for a fact that we cannot vet the people that are coming into our state from other parts of the world ＃ where they believe in ideologies that we don't.§ 20-year-old Kansas Muslim convert John T. Booker, Jr., could face life in prison for allegedly plotting to bomb a U.S. military base. Scapa's opponent, Democrat Elizabeth Bishop, criticized the mail campaign, saying the mailers could contribute to animosity toward Muslims in Wichita. (One can only hope) Led by Republican Governor Sam Brownback the state of Kansas informed the Obama administration this week that it is defying its dictates for Kansas to cooperate in the resettlement of refugees from Syria. In a letter to Robert Carey, director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Brownback wrote, ※The State of Kansas hereby withdraws its Refugee Resettlement Program State Plan and terminates its participation in all federal refugee resettlement grants and programs, effective at the earliest possible date.§ Hopefully, they are the last Brownback added that he was taking his action to ※protect the safety and security interests of the State of Kansas.§",

    "title": "Voting Machines Switching Trump Votes to Hillary Clinton: It Is Happening Again! | Crime All-Stars",
    "text": "(Before It's News)\nBy Michael Synder Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote.\nMost Americans don't realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney's chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state.\nUnfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a Quote: from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times ＃\n※I don't know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,§ said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens.\nStevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney .\n※I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney's name,§ Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House.\nShe said that the first time she pushed ※Romney,§ the machine marked ※Obama.§\nSo she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time.\n※Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,§ she told Fox News.\nAnd we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago.\nFor example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012.\nIf that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren't even worth mentioning.\nAnd of course this didn't just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country .\nThe reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again.\nIn Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper ＃\nShortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes ※switched.§ The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday.\nAnd Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas ＃\nGary and I went to early vote today＃I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn't get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don't hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed.\nI don't know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that.\nA similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas ＃\nHey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone's vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!\nAnd of course they weren't the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon ＃\nSo is there a serious problem with the voting machines?\nAccording to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots＃\nChambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters .\nChambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a ※software update§ on ES&S machines that otherwise ※omit one race§ when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch.\nLet's keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump's column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done.\nBut if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else.\nDespite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are ※ no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate ※＃\nIn 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country:\nNearly 2 million deceased registered to vote\nClose to 3 million registered in multiples states\nApproximately 24 million〞one of every eight〞voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate\nMore than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters\nApproximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state\nBut despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process.

    "title": "Electronic Voting Machines Caught Switching Trump Votes To Hillary: ※Trying to Steal Texas§ | Survival",
    "text": "(Before It's News)\nThis article was written by Michael Snyder and originally published at Economic Collapse blog .\nEditor's Comment: In particular with electronic voting, the opportunity to flip votes and steal elections is almost unstoppable and will be very difficult to hold accountable. Nonetheless, that is exactly what activists in Texas and other key states should focus on. After decades of solid ※red state§ status, they are now talking openly about Hillary winning the Lone Star State and flipping it blue＃ despite being perhaps the most despised, unlikable and untrustworthy presidential candidate in modern history.\nTake a look at the electoral college, and the shades of ＆blue and red states' as things have been＃ if Team Hillary is able to steal Texas, there will be no way for Trump to win 270 electoral college, even if he wins Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and other swing states. Perhaps this has been their secret weapon all along, and the reason that she has been so arrogant throughout the entire campaign:\nThese are dangerous times, and the establishment 每 after systematically denying the voice of the people on many fronts 每 is now making a huge gamble at holding onto power even in the face of obvious fraud. Will there be any legitimacy left in this country? And what happens if/when this election is stolen and everyone knows it?\nIt Is Happening Again! Voting Machines Are Switching Votes From Donald Trump To Hillary Clinton\nby Michael Snyder\nIs the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote.\nMost Americans don't realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney's chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state.\nUnfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a Quote: from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times ＃\n※I don't know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,§ said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens.\nStevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney .\n※I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney's name,§ Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House.\nShe said that the first time she pushed ※Romney,§ the machine marked ※Obama.§\nSo she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time.\n※Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,§ she told Fox News.\nAnd we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago.\nFor example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012.\nIf that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren't even worth mentioning.\nAnd of course this didn't just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country .\nThe reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again.\nIn Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper ＃\nShortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes ※switched.§ The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday.\nAnd Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas ＃\nGary and I went to early vote today＃I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn't get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don't hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed.\nI don't know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that.\nA similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas ＃\nHey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone's vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!\nAnd of course they weren't the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon ＃\nSo is there a serious problem with the voting machines?\nAccording to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots＃\nChambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters .\nChambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a ※software update§ on ES&S machines that otherwise ※omit one race§ when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch.\nLet's keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump's column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done.\nBut if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else.\nDespite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are ※no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate※＃\nIn 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country:\nNearly 2 million deceased registered to vote\nClose to 3 million registered in multiples states\nApproximately 24 million〞one of every eight〞voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate\nMore than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters\nApproximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state\nBut despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled ※ Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead ※＃\nAlmost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.\nAmericans overall are more confident that the nation's votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008.

    "title": "Donald Trump Hit With VERY Shady Voter Intimidation Lawsuit In Arizona (DETAILS)",
    "text": "0 1661 \nDonald Trump wants so-called ※poll watchers§ to scare people into not voting? Fine, then Arizona Democrats will sue their state GOP's sorry ass＃ And they've got a good chance of winning. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court's gutting of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 was a huge win for the Republican Party. Since high voter turnout 〞 especially high minority voter turnout 〞 creates victories for Democrats, it makes sense for the GOP to keep as many people from voting as they possibly can. There's just one thing the party of Donald Trump forgot: Voters still do have some rights, and the GOP doesn't get to do whatever the hell it wants. \nDonald Trump's calls for ※poll watchers§ to prevent nonexistent ※voter fraud§ may land the Republican Party in some serious hot water. AZ Central reports the Democratic Party of Arizona filed a lawsuit and seeks a court order banning Mein Trumpf's bands of brown shirts from the polling places. \n＆The suit filed in federal court in Phoenix Monday seeks an order blocking volunteer GOP poll watchers from harassing or photographing people headed to polling locations. The suit says the state Republican Party is essentially an arm of Trump's campaign and the campaign and its backers have been organizing ※citizen journalists§ and ※poll watchers§ to flood minority-heavy polling sites on Nov. 8.' \nAnd despite the demise of key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, they've still got some ammo. Last week, Rachel Maddow talked about something the GOP forgot about: That pesky old legal consent decree. Back in 1981, the Republican National Committee (RNC) employed similar ※poll watcher§ tactics during a tight governor race in New Jersey. Their ※Ballot Security Task Force§ employed heavy-handed tactics in minority districts and won the race for their candidate by a razor thin margin. \nUnfortunately, the GOP's short-term win backfired and had long-term consequences: a 35-year consent decree that puts strong limits on their ※poll watching§ activities. These legal restrictions don't expire until next year. Naturally, Donald Trump's renewed call for ※poll watchers§ has triggered concerns on the part of DNC lawyers at the national level. Now, they're demanding that the courts extend the consent decree through 2025. Watch: Rachel Maddow explains how Trump's call for ※poll watchers§ is causing legal trouble for the RNC. \nOf course, Tim Sifert, the state's GOP spokesman, insists these poll watchers aren't trying to intimidate voters. They're just helping ※monitor§ polling places since 〞 thanks to SCOTUS 〞 we no longer have as many actual monitors for U.S. elections. But, as POLITICO points out, there's a huge difference between having impartial observers around to provide advice and support for voters and poll workers and having ※poll watchers§ spreading misinformation and scaring voters. \n＆Trump seems to be advocating for a type of election monitoring that relies on volunteers to use deceptive practices that are often used to prevent people of color from voting. Voter suppression has changed since the era of literacy tests and poll taxes. In 2016, suppression occurs in two distinct stages: one before the election, and one at the polling locations themselves.' \nThe POLITICO article explains how the GOP tries to scare people into not voting in two stages. Stage 1: Before an election, Republicans try to keep people from casting their ballots with false 〞 and sometimes scary 〞 information. In 2008, mailers went out telling Democratic voters in Virginia that Election Day had been moved from Tuesday to Wednesday. Meanwhile, black neighborhoods in Milwaukee (2004) and Philadelphia (2008) got plastered with flyers warning that people with unpaid child support and parking tickets might get arrested when they show up to vote. Stage 2: On election day, so-called ※poll watchers§ 〞 often with fake badges and IDs that make them look like they're in positions of authority 〞 single out non-white voters with demands for ID and questions about their citizenship. They also often scare off eligible voters by taking photos and video footage (which sounds innocuous unless you happen to be among the roughly 7.5 million people being stalked each year). \nAnd, let's not forget 〞 here's what ※poll watchers§ looked like during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era.",

    "text": "Email \nIn an election season full of anger and divisiveness, it's easy to lose sight of just how important and meaningful our democratic process is. Thankfully, as millions have cast their ballots today, there's been no shortage of heartwarming stories involving Americans exercising their right to vote. One of those stories centers around lifelong Mississippi resident Helen Karnes, who, although not quite old enough to have been born before women won the right to vote, is still pretty goddam old. \nWow. What a special woman! \nWhile Karnes can't claim that she was alive during a time when women were still politically disenfranchised, it just takes one look at her to tell that she's fucking old. No, she might not have the inspiring, thematically satisfying story of a 100-year-old, but you get the sense that she's definitely lived through some shit. She was certainly around in WWII times, and she might've even been there for the Depression, too. Who knows? This is no spring chicken we're talking about here. \nThough, admittedly, Karnes' story would be a bit cooler if she'd been alive before 1920, you still have to applaud her for being old on this historic Election Day. Also, her mom and her aunts were definitely alive before women's suffrage, so you know she's probably got some good secondhand stories that she heard from them. Maybe one of them was even an important figure in the women's rights movement or something. Statistically speaking, that's probably not the case, but you never know! \nIt's unclear if Karnes voted today for America's first female presidential nominee, or if she even voted at all. But what matters is that she's brittle, stooped-over, and ancient. There are probably lots of dusty ol＆ bats out there who are older than Karnes and who have more of a substantial foothold in U.S. women's history, but this lady is still more or less a living skeleton. And that's something that should make us all proud to be Americans.",

    "text": "Email \nIn case this election wasn't already infuriating enough, here's something that's really going to make your blood boil. With hours to go before polls close, voter watchdog groups across the country are reporting that many laser tag establishments are staying open today. \nThis is seriously alarming news. \nIn what appears to be a concerted effort to prevent Americans from casting their ballots on time, dozens of laser tag locations are keeping normal business hours on Election Day, inviting one and all to enjoy nonstop laser tag action with all the coolest terrain and equipment. \nIf true, this could represent voter suppression on an unprecedented, scarcely conceivable scale. It's appalling to see laser tag places〞some of them located within blocks of polling stations in swing states〞deploying everything from signs to roadside billboards to social media posts in an attempt to stop Americans from exercising their civic duty. Just take a look at this truly disgusting tweet: \nGeorge Washington is rolling over in his grave right now. \nAccording to Leanne Holst, spokesman for the watchdog group Voter Vigilance, laser tag may only be the tip of the iceberg. \n※Some of these laser tag facilities are continuing to operate roller rinks, 18-hole mini golf courses, and go-kart tracks in a shameless ploy to lure voters as far as possible from the booths,§ said Holst. ※It's an utterly transparent tactic, and the saddest thing is just how effective it can be. Laser tag arenas represent a grave, immediate threat to the democratic process.§ \nBelow, via Voter Vigilance, is a partial, ongoing list of laser tag places that have not closed for Election Day, and several with the sheer audacity to offer off-peak, daytime discounts. Lightspeed Go-Karts & Laser Tag (Greenfield, WI) Code Red Laser Tag (Dallas-Fort Worth, TX) Laser Tag Kingdom (Monroe, NH) QZAR (Carle Place, NY) Laser Quest (numerous locations nationwide) Zap Zone (Sterling Heights, MI) Battle Blast Laser Tag (Las Vegas, NV) Lazer Kraze Laser Tag (Erlanger, KY) \nIf you know of a laser tag place in your district that remains open today, do not be silent. Post their names and pictures in the comments so that we can put a stop to this assault on democracy before any further damage is done.",

Republican or Democrat, these patriotic volunteers want every American to have access to a frictionless slick of oil that leads right to a polling place. \nYes! These incredible volunteers are absolutely killing it! \nRather than letting our election be decided by a select few, people from across the nation are volunteering their time to make sidewalks well-lubricated and slippery for as many voters as possible. As of this morning, footpaths have been oiled in all 50 states, giving people who would not otherwise have the time or desire to vote the opportunity to lose their balance and slide forward at alarming speeds with their arms flailing and legs kicking, until they crash face-first into a registered polling location. \nWe might live in a democracy, but we wouldn't have a truly representative election without the help of a select few everyday heroes.

    "text": "Email \nWell, if this doesn't inspire you to do your civic duty, nothing will! \nWhen California resident Candice Payne woke up this morning, she wasn't totally sure she was up to going through the hassle of voting. She figured the lines would be long, the wait would be awful, and the stress probably wouldn't be worth it. But just when this 26-year-old woman was feeling too lazy to vote, something absolutely amazing happened〞her ovaries burst out of her body and dragged her to the polling place. \nAmazing! Now THAT is how you rally on Election Day! \nLike so many Americans, Candice spent her morning lying in her bed, kicking herself for not having voted early, but as soon as it seemed like she'd go back to sleep, her fallopian tubes shot out of her abdomen, curled themselves around the side of her bed, and threw her to the floor. After dragging her body to her living room, her helpful ovaries crawled up to the doorknob and jostled the front door open. What started out as a lazy morning ended with her ovaries anchoring themselves to the floor and pulling the rest of her body to a polling place at nearby Jefferson Public School, where she dutifully filled out her ballot for President of the United States! \nIf that's not getting out the vote, we don't know what is! It's definitely easy to come up with a million excuses to avoid the polls, but once Candice's ovaries had shot out of her body, they weren't going to retract back inside until she had done her civic duty! \nWhile it might have been a bit of an inconvenience to spend the morning voting, no matter how much she tried to resist, Candice's ovaries kept pulling and clawing at the floor, dragging her flailing body farther and farther until she arrived at a voting booth to cast her vote. Sure, she would rather have been sleeping, or at work, but three miles and several forceful tugs later, she was inside a voting booth and back on her feet, casting her ballot, and exercising her fundamental American right. \nAwesome. If you're thinking of just staying inside, going to work, and skipping the polls altogether, it's not too late to change your mind. Candice felt just like you once, but after being violently dragged by her ovaries to a polling station, she's never felt better!",

    "text": "Posted by Alex Cooper | Nov 25, 2016 | Breaking News Hacking Group ※Anonymous§ Has Issued A CHILLING Announcement \nSomething seriously bad is happening right now and it's about to shift the face of democracy in the free world. \nGeorge Soros is well known by now for his donations to BLM and other extreme leftist groups, not to mention the millions he's given Hillary. \nThings just went to code red though, because Jill Stein has just initiated a campaign to demand a recount of the vote. \nWhat is about to happen could possibly cause a civil war. Anonymous, the infamous group responsible for hacking multiple high-level officials and agencies, just made a grave announcement: \n※It's over, folks. \nThey are absolutely taking this from Trump. If you were able to see these stories they already have prepared for us to start running next week, your jaw would hit the ground. \nThey are going to ※find§ that the results were indeed ※hacked§. They have everything set in place, and have been ready to play this out for over a week. \nAll 3 states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania) are going to be reversed and awarded to Hillary Clinton. Speculations are in the midst of who is pulling the strings, but this is undoubtedly going to happen. \nStart preparing for the news to pour in, NOW. \nWhen Michigan is reversed, it will send a clear message of irreversible corruption; the state had only paper ballots. Furthermore, the votes have already been certified. The stringent program was designed specifically to defend against cyber attacks.§ \nThere is already evidence that death threats were sent to multiple electors, but that didn't work. Jill stein has already raised enough money to trigger a complete recount of the votes in Wisconsin〞the other 2 states are even cheaper. This is BAD News \nTrump may have taken Michigan, but it won't matter. Jill Stein demanded a recount, and as a third party it will be carried out. The election WILL be rigged. January 20 th is literally 2 months away. Do you seriously think they are going to remain idle for 2 months? \nI'm a realist〞I call it like it is and I don't care who I offend. But, do not be mistaken. This is BAD news. \nIt's already happening. Multiple fake ※computer experts§ have stated there are ※anomalies§ in the vote that favor Trump. Who have they blamed? Russia. \nSo then what happened next? Jill Stein was able to push a recount order on these grounds. If foul play is ※detected§, a recount can be initiated (even if the ※foul play§ is completely false and planned as a scapegoat to initiate the recount for Hillary). Rogue Hacking Groups Like Anonymous And WikiLeaks Gave Us A TREMENDOUS Amount Of Factual Information During The Election Race. This Warning Is Not To Be Taken Lightly. \nBut wait a second. How is Jill Stein connected to Hillary and why would the recount benefit Clinton? The answer lies in a serious screw-up that became apparent when a bot was found in the donation system. \nGo to the fundraising website and see for yourself! The campaign was started literally yesterday and already has over $4,000,000 in donations! This Is NO Coincidence. Do You Think A Man Who Has Spent BILLIONS Will Stop Now? The Media Is On His Side, Pushing The Entire Narrative! \nThat's not the scary part though. What gives away the entire operation is the behavior of the donations. The funding came in at an absolutely perfect $160,000 per hour. That wouldn't be odd, except the donations continued full speed through the middle of the night when all of America was asleep! \nJill Stein now has the money she needs to initiate the recount. Where did the funds come from? Soros. The mainstream media is pushing the narrative hard right now that the votes were hacked, even In Pennsylvania where that's not even possible . \nThey are openly and brazenly lying about everything. Google, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter are all censoring the spread of this information, creating dissent and misinformation. To make things even worse, the establishment has launched a campaign against ※fake news§, allowing the mainstream media to dictate reality for hundreds of millions of Americans who receive constant news! \nThis is BAD news people, and it's about to get even worse. There is no reason they would be attempting to pull this stunt unless they had absolute certainty it would execute successfully. \nPlease spread word of what is about to come. I will continue to keep you informed, but you must join me in this fight and spread word. This news is being suppressed on literally every channel. We must fight back. \nAlex Cooper, CDP, Reports.",

They have little to show for supporting liberals but more strife and tension from a black president who promised hope and change. \nMoreover, President Barack Obama has done more to increase racial tension in this country than anyone could have guessed. Many black voters understand that, and they do not see Clinton as someone they can trust to change it. \nTrump has suggested that Democrats have done nothing to help black communities and has pointed out that they often suffer the most from a breakdown of law and order.

    "text": "In Florida, early polling results showed independents favoring Trump. In addition, slightly more Republicans than Democrats have turned in early ballots, so it is likely that he is leading in Florida so far. \nTrump led among independents in Iowa too. \nOne state where that has not been the case, however, has been Colorado. However, potentially offsetting that is the fact that, so far, men have turned in almost as many early ballots as women. That has not been the case in other states, and since men tend to support Trump at a higher percentage than women, it's good news for the Trump camp.   \nThese numbers indicate how important independent voters are in this election, and they prove Trump has more of an opportunity of winning the election than most liberals would have anyone believe. \nShare this story Facebook and Twitter to spread the word about how Trump is leading among independent voters in some key swing states.

    "text": "Video: Trump Voter Dragged from His Car, Brutally Beaten, and Robbed by Gang of Hillary Supporters By: Chase Stephens November 10, 2016 \nA YouTube video that's making the rounds appears to show a man being beaten and robbed in the middle of the street by a group laughing and shouting that he voted for Trump. \nIn the clip (below), what appears to be a middle-aged white man is on the ground while two younger black males are hitting and kicking him in the head. The camera person yells, \"Happens when you vote Trump, dummy,\" while a woman next to him shouts, \"You voted Trump? You voted Trump? Damn! Yeah, he voted Trump! Damn!\" \n\n\nThe man continues to struggle against his two attackers until he gets up and sees that a woman, presumably associated with the attackers, is going through the his car looking for valuables. \n\"Get out of my car,\" the man yells as he approaches the women, who shouts back, \"You're gonna pay for my shit!\" One of the attackers returns and starts punching the man from behind in the back of the head and then continues swinging as the man turns around. \nThe camera man and his companion continue their color commentary by laughing and yelling, \"Beat his ass! Don't vote Trump! Don't vote Trump!\" \nThe video ends with the group acknowledging that they should leave before the police arrive. \nIn the longer version of the video (below) posted on Twitter, one of the attackers gets into the driver's seat and closes the door. The beaten Trump supporter stands at the car window, presumably telling the thief to get out, as the woman starts to punch him in the back of the head and is joined by the second attacker. \nThe criminal then hits the gas and takes off in the car as the man desperately holds on from outside through the rear door's window while being dragged through the streets. \n(Warning: strong language) Blacks beat white man, steal car, dragging his body.

    "title": "Why Did They Vote For Trump?",
    "text": "By Andre Vltchek WHY DID THEY VOTE FOR THIS MAN? \n※If we don't understand why that choice was made, we will all get fucked, soon, and not only in North America, but also all over the world!§ 〞 Andre Vltchek \nSince the results of the latest Presidential elections were announced, I am longing for silence, while the overwhelming cacophony of deafening noises is assaulting my ears, and in fact all my senses. \nSuddenly everyone around me wants to speak, to shout, and to declare. Lately, people who are surrounding me, as well as those who are far away from me are frantically watching the news, reading newspapers and browsing through countless political websites. \nMy friends and comrades all over the world are poking jokes at the US political establishment, or trembling in anticipation of something terrible, even apocalyptic. \nMany are just having fun. Even some thoughtful and educated individuals are behaving like obsessive football fans: analyzing, passing judgments, and spending countless hours on the couch, in front of their television screens. \nOf course there are also many gigantic protests in countless American cities against the President-elect, Donald Trump, the 45th leader of the mightiest nation on Earth. There are some massive protests, desperate protests, and hopeless protests. There are also personal protests, resigned shrugs of shoulders and downcast glances. \nOverall there is a lot of noise. Everyone is speaking from the top of his or her lungs. Actually, people are shouting over each other. They want to be heard, desperately. While very few are listening. Very few also appear to be reflecting on what is being said by the others, on what is truly happening, on what has happened. \nDespite millions of words and images assaulting our brains from all directions, I know that something is definitely missing, something important, and even something essential. It is not just my analytical mind that comprehends this; it is also my intuition. \nAs a result, I want to smash those television sets in my vicinity, I want to throw newspapers into the garbage bin, and I want to go away, far away, from all my politicizing friends and comrades. \nBut what is it that is being omitted in the official and even in the alternative narrative? What is it that I want to hear, longing to hear so much ＃ longing with such force, even with such desperation? \nAm I desperate for some precise analyses, for exact numbers, for revealing facts? Am I yearning for one brilliant study, for a report? Do I want to hear from someone why on earth did the American people elect someone like him, like Donald Trump? Or is it all actually much more simple and selfish: do I expect those wise words to come from my own brain, typed into my computer with my own fingers? \nHow did it all really come to this? And why? What will happen now? What will happen to them (to the voters), what will happen to America, the country, which despite everything used to be my home for many years? What will happen to America which took so much, but which also gave me plenty? I kept asking, above all, what will happen to the world, to the entire world, which is now my true home, and which is also their true home (home of the American voters), although perhaps they do not fully comprehend it yet. \nNo, I did not want to hear the facts! I couldn't care less about the numbers. I was not longing for analyses, and I felt absolutely no desire to speak! \nSuddenly, there was only one longing left in me: to listen, to hear, to absorb the millions of voices of those who just recently went to the polls and stuck those pieces of paper into boxes, most likely changing the destiny of the world. And since I knew I wouldn't be able to absorb millions of testimonies, I wanted to listen to at least a few hundred or even thousands of them if possible. \nI wanted to hear the stories of those men and women from the Rustbelt states, from the Deep South, from isolated farms and exhausted mining towns. I wanted to put my glass of beer next to theirs, in some god-forsaken bar, and just nod and whisper what so many storytellers before me, have done for millennia, and what they will be saying for many centuries to come: ※Please tell me your story＃§ \nI want to hear their stories so I can collect them, arrange them, and pass them onto the world. \nI want the people who voted for Donald Trump to speak to me, to explain, to let me into their thoughts and emotions. I want to understand what occurred through their stories. \nI don't want to judge. I am usually very judgmental, very political, and very ideological. This time I have no desire to be ＃ This is too serious; too damn serious! \nI owe America that much. That is the least I can do. To return there, to fly there all the way from Asia, to rent a car, and drive from coast to coast, for long weeks, and to finally listen to people, trying to understand who they are, what they did, and why? \n※I am what I am because I am a passionate listener,§ I was once told by one of the greatest Latin American writers, Eduardo Galeano. ※People always know what goes on. All we have to do is to listen to them. And we have to lead them only when they ask us, when they order us to do so.§ \nThere is no doubt in my mind that now is the time to attentively listen to the American people; to fill newspapers and websites with their words. But almost no one seems to be doing that. \nAll we hear is ＆why they voted as they did'. How they voted: women, minorities, particular classes or states ＃ We read about numbers. But we don't hear people speaking! We don't hear them formulating the words. \nAnd that is what I am longing for: to shut up, to be silent, and to listen. And I want other intellectuals to shut up and to humbly listen too, finally! \nNot because I agree with what they, the voters, have done. Not because I want Donald Trump to lead the country and the Empire. Not because I suddenly ＆fell in love with the small people'. \nIt is simply because the people of the most powerful country on Earth have spoken, because they made their choice. And because, if we don't understand why that choice was made, we will all get fucked, soon, and not only in North America, but also all over the world! \nI want to listen and to understand so the course of action can be determined, so that we know where all this will lead ＃ because this is not the end, just the beginning＃ of something＃ Because not only people in the United States, but also in Europe want something, and listening to the analysts from both parts of the world, and by just ＆reading facts and numbers', I have absolutely no clue what it is! \nDo voters want some new form of participatory democracy? Do they want neo-fascism? Are they thoroughly selfish or is there at least some internationalist essence in their souls? \nWe can only find out if we let them speak. And that is why I am longing for silence, and then for their voices to resonate, so we know, we know now, before the thunder and flames swallow our Planet, and before it is too late.",

    "title": "Comment on It Is Happening Again America! Voting Machines Are Switching Votes From Donald Trump To Hillary Clinton by donaldbreaux",
    "text": "Posted on October 26, 2016 by Michael Snyder \nIs the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote. \nMost Americans don't realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney's chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state. \nUnfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a quote from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times ＃ \n※I don't know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,§ said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens. \nStevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney . \n※I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney's name,§ Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House. \nShe said that the first time she pushed ※Romney,§ the machine marked ※Obama.§ \nSo she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time. \n※Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,§ she told Fox News. \nAnd we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago. \nFor example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012. \nIf that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren't even worth mentioning. \nAnd of course this didn't just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country . \nThe reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again. \nIn Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper ＃ \nShortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes ※switched.§ The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday. \nAnd Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas ＃ \nGary and I went to early vote today＃I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn't get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don't hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed. \nI don't know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that. \nA similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas ＃ \nHey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone's vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit! \nAnd of course they weren't the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon ＃ \nSo is there a serious problem with the voting machines ? \nAccording to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots＃ \nChambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters . \nChambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a ※software update§ on ES&S machines that otherwise ※omit one race§ when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch. \nLet's keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump's column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done. \nBut if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else. \nDespite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are ※no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate※＃ In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country: Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote Close to 3 million registered in multiples states Approximately 24 million〞one of every eight〞voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state \nBut despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled ※ Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead ※＃ \nAlmost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. \nAmericans overall are more confident that the nation's votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner. \nUnfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media. \nAnd the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up ＃ \nU.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia's intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud. \nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. \nBut hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. \nNow that is a real ※conspiracy theory§, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn't so serious. \nDuring this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it. \nThe American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us. \nAnd let's watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong. \nCourtesy of Michael Snyder Don't forget to follow the D.C. Clothesline on Facebook and Twitter.

    "title": "6 Places Voter Fraud Has Already Happened＃ But Don't Worry",
    "text": "Remember the last debate when the internet blew up because Donald Trump said he wouldn't necessarily accept the results of the election ? People were bemoaning him as a fascist and no one in the mainstream wanted to admit that our election process is entirely rigged . The trouble is, voter fraud on a grand scale can be tough to prove . \nAs it turns out, voter fraud on a smaller scale has been detected in 6 locations already, according to today's Drudge Report . But don't worry. These are just ※glitches§ or ※too few to make a difference.§ 1) Chicago \nIn the Windy City, the dead have been voting for decades. Two investigators have admitted finding proof of this, but they refuse to say that there is fraud. Relatives of the Voting Dead feel differently. They say that they've reported the deaths of their loved ones repeatedly, but that the names have not been removed from the rolls. But that isn't the worst of it 每 not only are these people on the rolls 每 they've repeatedly voted since their deaths. \nDon't worry, though. It's just a few hundred dead voters that they've been able to confirm. No biggie. ( source ) 2) Philadelphia \nChicago is not alone with the dead folks voting.There are also reports from Philadelphia that people are making their voices heard from beyond the grave. *cough* Local station Action News 6 investigated and found that a stunning number of people have been deemed ※active voters§ for many years since their deaths. \nDon't worry, though. The local voting board says these mistakes are simply ※human error§ and that there aren't enough dead voters to actually sway the election. ( source ) 3) Hollywood, Maryland \nA woman in Maryland has reported another incidence of ※vote flipping.§ She voted a straight Republican ticket, then checked after it was submitted. Her vote for Trump had been switched to a vote for Clinton. \nDon't worry, though. The election officials there told her to just vote again. Of course, this would ※undo§ the vote for Clinton, but would it really count as a vote for Trump? I'm sure it's fine. The election officials would want to be scrupulous about something like that. ( source ) 4) Miami-Dade County, Florida \nTwo women have been charged with felony counts of tampering with the election. One, a temporary election worker, was caught marking ballots by her co-workers. The other was caught filling out voter registration paperwork for people who did not exist. \nDon't worry, though. These were isolated incidents that have been dealt with. In the words of State Attorney Katherine Fern芍ndez Rundle, a Democrat, ※Anyone who attempts to undermine the democratic process should recognize that there is an enforcement partnership between the elections department and our prosecution task force in place to thwart such efforts and arrest those involved. Now we need to move forward with the election.§ ( source ) 5) Alexandria, Virginia \nA guy in Virginia who was formerly employed by the New Virginia Majority, an advocacy group aligned with the Democratic party, was caught using fake names to fill out voter registration applications. \nBut don't worry. Commonwealth Attorney Bryan Porter said, ※Since the fraudulent applications involved fictitious people, had the fraud not been uncovered the risk of actual fraudulent votes being cast was low.§ ( source ) 6) Lots of places in Texas \nMuch like the report in Maryland, voters in various locations in Texas have reported that when they chose a straight Republican ticket, the voting machines opted for Clinton/Kaine instead of Trump/Pence . Voters in Amarillo, Arlington, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Cypress, Mesquite, and El Paso have all reported vote flipping from Trump to Clinton. \nBut don't worry.

As we reported earlier this week, voters in numerous areas of Texas have made a series of complaints that votes are being switched from Trump to Clinton .

When you get to the final page you may review your entire ballot, when you see the error it clearly tells you what to do to correct it. \nGenerally these issues happen because the voter isn't focused on what they're touching on the screen and it's most often with first time voters or those who have difficulty using an electronic tablet. misterdawg \nThis isn't BS, It happen to me when John McCain was running against Obuma. I voted a straight GOP ticket and when it came up to vote, It was changed to all Democrats, I had it changed and when we got home, I told my wife that I guess I had made a mistake and she told me that our son's vote had been changed also and he had caught it to, before he had push the vote button.

    "text": "Remember the last debate when the internet blew up because Donald Trump said he wouldn't necessarily accept the results of the election ? People were bemoaning him as a fascist and no one in the mainstream wanted to admit that our election process is entirely rigged . The trouble is, voter fraud on a grand scale can be tough to prove . \nAs it turns out, voter fraud on a smaller scale has been detected in 6 locations already, according to today's Drudge Report . But don't worry. These are just ※glitches§ or ※too few to make a difference.§ 1) Chicago \nIn the Windy City, the dead have been voting for decades. Two investigators have admitted finding proof of this, but they refuse to say that there is fraud. Relatives of the Voting Dead feel differently. They say that they've reported the deaths of their loved ones repeatedly, but that the names have not been removed from the rolls. But that isn't the worst of it 每 not only are these people on the rolls 每 they've repeatedly voted since their deaths. \nDon't worry, though. It's just a few hundred dead voters that they've been able to confirm. No biggie. ( source ) 2) Philadelphia \nChicago is not alone with the dead folks voting.There are also reports from Philadelphia that people are making their voices heard from beyond the grave. *cough* Local station Action News 6 investigated and found that a stunning number of people have been deemed ※active voters§ for many years since their deaths. \nDon't worry, though. The local voting board says these mistakes are simply ※human error§ and that there aren't enough dead voters to actually sway the election. ( source ) 3) Hollywood, Maryland \nA woman in Maryland has reported another incidence of ※vote flipping.§ She voted a straight Republican ticket, then checked after it was submitted. Her vote for Trump had been switched to a vote for Clinton. \nDon't worry, though. The election officials there told her to just vote again. Of course, this would ※undo§ the vote for Clinton, but would it really count as a vote for Trump? I'm sure it's fine. The election officials would want to be scrupulous about something like that. ( source ) 4) Miami-Dade County, Florida \nTwo women have been charged with felony counts of tampering with the election. One, a temporary election worker, was caught marking ballots by her co-workers. The other was caught filling out voter registration paperwork for people who did not exist. \nDon't worry, though. These were isolated incidents that have been dealt with. In the words of State Attorney Katherine Fern芍ndez Rundle, a Democrat, ※Anyone who attempts to undermine the democratic process should recognize that there is an enforcement partnership between the elections department and our prosecution task force in place to thwart such efforts and arrest those involved. Now we need to move forward with the election.§ ( source ) 5) Alexandria, Virginia \nA guy in Virginia who was formerly employed by the New Virginia Majority, an advocacy group aligned with the Democratic party, was caught using fake names to fill out voter registration applications. \nBut don't worry. Commonwealth Attorney Bryan Porter said, ※Since the fraudulent applications involved fictitious people, had the fraud not been uncovered the risk of actual fraudulent votes being cast was low.§ ( source ) 6) Lots of places in Texas \nMuch like the report in Maryland, voters in various locations in Texas have reported that when they chose a straight Republican ticket, the voting machines opted for Clinton/Kaine instead of Trump/Pence . Voters in Amarillo, Arlington, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Cypress, Mesquite, and El Paso have all reported vote flipping from Trump to Clinton. \nBut don't worry. Election officials in the state say it's not a problem with the equipment . It's just those silly voters who don't know how to use it. ※※Typically, we've found it's voter error with the equipment.

    "text": "Posted on October 30, 2016 by Tim Brown \nAmong the many Wikileaks emails that were dumped this summer, it was clear that Hillary Clinton is not as popular as the media would have you believe. In fact, it became clear that she has no real support in a hacked email to the point where she was forced to pay young voters to stump online for her. \nThe Gateway Pundit reported : \nShe's the astroturfed candidate. Hillary is SOOO unpopular that she has to pay off young voters to support her and show up at her rallies. \n5 Biggest Scoops from the #DNCLeaks WikiLeak \nWikileaks released nearly 20,000 hacked emails it says are from the accounts of Democratic National Committee officials on Friday. \nThe emails are devastating for Hillary Clinton. According to at least one hacked email Hillary Clinton has no real support and must pay youth voters to defend her online. She also pays millennials to show up at her rallies. \nHillary's support is all a lie. It's all astroturfed. Everything this woman does is all a lie 每 even her rallies are fabricated. \nIf Attkisson's explanation were not enough, how about this tweet regarding the mainstream media putting their collective useful idiot heads together to pitch the same propaganda about Donald Trump. 5 Biggest Scoops from the #DNCLeaks https://t.co/vmTiepsPkj \n〞 Mike Cernovich ????

The majority of those were reporters! \nHillary Clinton only has the backing of the media and rabid anti-American liberals, and even then, it looks like she's having to pay them to actually do anything to support her.

    "title": "Texas Police Arrest Trump Voter for Wearing ※Deplorable§ T-Shirt",
    "text": "Posted by Tim Brown \nOn Monday, a man who voted for Donald Trump was arrested for wearing a T-shirt that referenced Hillary Clinton ＆s comments about Trump supporters being ※ deplorables § to the polls. \nBrett Mauthe, 55, was arrested after he went to the polls wearing a pro-Trump hat and a shirt that read, ※ basket of deplorables .§ \nAccording to KSAT 12, Mauthe removed his hat at the request of those who were overseeing the polls. However, since the t-shirt did not violate the election code, he refused to turn it inside out nor remove it. \nSubsequently, he was arrested and charged with electioneering. \nKSAT 12 reports : \nBulverde police Chief Gary Haecker confirmed the arrest but declined to release details. Instead, he deferred to Comal County's election coordinator, Cynthia Jaqua. \nJaqua said the offense of electioneering isn't limited to people who stand outside polling places holding signs. Violations can be committed by voters as well. \n※It can mean a T-shirt, a button, a hat, you know?§ she said. ※Anything related to the voting, the party, the candidate.§ \nJaqua declined to release specific details about Mauthe's arrest. \nJaqua is quoted by My San Antonio : \nIt's in the election code. Electioneering is prohibited within a 100-foot marker. You cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons, T-shirts, hats, whatever else or carrying signs,§ she said. \nMost people who make the mistake manage to avoid going to jail, she added. \n※Every election we have to advise people. Even if it's a school bond issue. They wear candidates' shirts and we just have to remind them. ＆Please go into the restroom and turn it inside out.' This is the first time I recall someone getting arrested,§ she said, during two decades working at the county election office. \n※A gentleman did walk in a little while ago with a slogan for Trump, and when I asked him to please take it off, he was real nice, and took it off,§ she added, while working a polling site Thursday afternoon in New Braunfels. \nSo, according to this nonsense, a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day, but if a politician makes reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day? This is utterly ridiculous. \nMy question on all of that is, what happened to free speech? Is that recognized as a God-given right in the First Amendment? I mean, I realize that the Constitution is to restrict the federal government, but honestly, shouldn't the states recognize the right of free speech, even in a polling place? Seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected. \nOther voters agree with me. \n※I don't feel like you should be preaching to anybody, but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate,§ Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote. ※I'm kind of shocked, because I think that's part of the freedoms that we're voting for.§ \nJose Tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are 18 and vote. Again, I ask, why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech? It's not inflammatory. It isn't a lie. It isn't slander. What's illegal about it? \nI'll tell you, politicians want to control people, and this is one of many means they use to do that. This is what happens when you don't hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose. \nMauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media. \n※The reason I'm not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around, and I don't want to give you any comment,§ he said . \nThe charged of electioneering is a class C misdemeanor. \nCourtesy of Freedom Outpost \nTim Brown is an author and Editor at FreedomOutpost.com , SonsOfLibertyMedia.com , GunsInTheNews.com and TheWashingtonStandard.com .

In fact, it became clear that she has no real support in a hacked email to the point where she was forced to pay young voters to stump online for her. \nThe Gateway Pundit reported : \nShe's the astroturfed candidate. Hillary is SOOO unpopular that she has to pay off young voters to support her and show up at her rallies. \n5 Biggest Scoops from the #DNCLeaks WikiLeak \nWikileaks released nearly 20,000 hacked emails it says are from the accounts of Democratic National Committee officials on Friday. \nThe emails are devastating for Hillary Clinton. According to at least one hacked email Hillary Clinton has no real support and must pay youth voters to defend her online. She also pays millennials to show up at her rallies. \nHillary's support is all a lie. It's all astroturfed. Everything this woman does is all a lie 每 even her rallies are fabricated. \nIf Attkisson's explanation were not enough, how about this tweet regarding the mainstream media putting their collective useful idiot heads together to pitch the same propaganda about Donald Trump. 5 Biggest Scoops from the #DNCLeaks https://t.co/vmTiepsPkj \n〞 Mike Cernovich ????

The majority of those were reporters! \nHillary Clinton only has the backing of the media and rabid anti-American liberals, and even then, it looks like she's having to pay them to actually do anything to support her. In other words, her candidacy is completely contrived. \nCourtesy of Freedom Outpost \nTim Brown is an author and Editor at FreedomOutpost.com , SonsOfLibertyMedia.com , GunsInTheNews.com and TheWashingtonStandard.com .

    "title": "Comment on Texas Police Arrest Trump Voter for Wearing ※Deplorable§ T-Shirt by Terry",
    "text": "Posted on October 30, 2016 by Tim Brown \nOn Monday, a man who voted for Donald Trump was arrested for wearing a T-shirt that referenced Hillary Clinton ＆s comments about Trump supporters being ※ deplorables § to the polls. \nBrett Mauthe, 55, was arrested after he went to the polls wearing a pro-Trump hat and a shirt that read, ※ basket of deplorables .§ \nAccording to KSAT 12, Mauthe removed his hat at the request of those who were overseeing the polls. However, since the t-shirt did not violate the election code, he refused to turn it inside out nor remove it. \nSubsequently, he was arrested and charged with electioneering. \nKSAT 12 reports : \nBulverde police Chief Gary Haecker confirmed the arrest but declined to release details. Instead, he deferred to Comal County's election coordinator, Cynthia Jaqua. \nJaqua said the offense of electioneering isn't limited to people who stand outside polling places holding signs. Violations can be committed by voters as well. \n※It can mean a T-shirt, a button, a hat, you know?§ she said. ※Anything related to the voting, the party, the candidate.§ \nJaqua declined to release specific details about Mauthe's arrest. \nJaqua is quoted by My San Antonio : \nIt's in the election code. Electioneering is prohibited within a 100-foot marker. You cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons, T-shirts, hats, whatever else or carrying signs,§ she said. \nMost people who make the mistake manage to avoid going to jail, she added. \n※Every election we have to advise people. Even if it's a school bond issue. They wear candidates' shirts and we just have to remind them. ＆Please go into the restroom and turn it inside out.' This is the first time I recall someone getting arrested,§ she said, during two decades working at the county election office. \n※A gentleman did walk in a little while ago with a slogan for Trump, and when I asked him to please take it off, he was real nice, and took it off,§ she added, while working a polling site Thursday afternoon in New Braunfels. \nSo, according to this nonsense, a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day, but if a politician makes reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day? This is utterly ridiculous. \nMy question on all of that is, what happened to free speech? Is that recognized as a God-given right in the First Amendment? I mean, I realize that the Constitution is to restrict the federal government, but honestly, shouldn't the states recognize the right of free speech, even in a polling place? Seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected. \nOther voters agree with me. \n※I don't feel like you should be preaching to anybody, but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate,§ Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote. ※I'm kind of shocked, because I think that's part of the freedoms that we're voting for.§ \nJose Tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are 18 and vote. Again, I ask, why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech? It's not inflammatory. It isn't a lie. It isn't slander. What's illegal about it? \nI'll tell you, politicians want to control people, and this is one of many means they use to do that. This is what happens when you don't hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose. \nMauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media. \n※The reason I'm not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around, and I don't want to give you any comment,§ he said . \nThe charged of electioneering is a class C misdemeanor. \nCourtesy of Freedom Outpost \nTim Brown is an author and Editor at FreedomOutpost.com , SonsOfLibertyMedia.com , GunsInTheNews.com and TheWashingtonStandard.com .

You can read the op-ed by clicking here . The op-ed offers explanations about why some states offer early voting, and I express reasons how it can negatively effect an election. \nOf all my opinions given, the one that stands out most today is this one: Anything can happen in a presidential election. By voting early, early voters cut themselves short in the event something negative happens to the candidate they voted for. \nWith just ten days left until Nov. 8, it was revealed yesterday that Hillary Clinton is once again under FBI investigation for her private email server. Thus, the question becomes can citizens who voted early change their votes?

OK?§ the 58-year-old Rebel Heart singer told an audience at New York's Madison Square Garden Tuesday night. ※I'm really good. I'm not a douche, and I'm not a tool. I take my time, I have a lot of eye contact, and I do swallow.§ \nThe comments came as Madonna warmed up the crowd with a very brief standup set ahead of the Trainwreck star's performance at the Garden Tuesday night, according to the New York Daily News . \nSchumer took the stage afterward for her first stand-up gig since hundreds of supporters of Republican candidate Donald Trump stood up and walked out of her performance in Tampa, Florida earlier this week after the comedian called him an ※orange monster.§ As Breitbart previously reported, Shumer was widely booed during the performance at Tampa's Amalie Arena, where she instructed security to remove hecklers. \nDuring her performance Tuesday night, Schumer read aloud a letter she composed in response to the Trump fans who walked out on her show in Tampa. \n※Dearest Tampa, I'm sorry you didn't want me, a comedian who talks about what she believes in, to mention the biggest thing going on in our country right now,§ Schumer said, adding: ※How could I think it was OK to spend five minutes having a peaceful conversation with someone with different views? After the show, I want you to know that I will go straight to a rehab facility.§ \nThe comedian added that she looks forward to ※putting this all behind us§ in November, when ※ Hillary Clinton is our motherf*cking president.§ \nMadonna has previously used sex appeal to drum up support for the Democratic presidential candidate; in September, the singer joined fellow pop star Katy Perry in stripping off her clothes to encourage Clinton voters to head to the polls in November.",

    "text": "Home / News / The African voters in the US who want Donald Trump as their president The African voters in the US who want Donald Trump as their president fisher 1 min ago News Comments Off on The African voters in the US who want Donald Trump as their president The African voters in the US who want Donald Trump as their president In less than 48 hours, Americans will go to the polls to elect a new president. But no matter what happens on election day (Nov. 8), Trump will not win the majority of the black vote. Many of them are expected to heed the message of president Obama who has warned that the Republican candidate will undo his administration's legacy. But Trump 's message〞to make America great again〞might still draw an unlikely group of supporters from within the black community: African immigrants. Foreign-born Africans make up a small share of the US immigrant population, but their numbers have been doubling every decade since 1970. African immigrants living in the US grew from 80,000 in 1970 to 1.8 million as of 2013, according to a study from the Pew Research Center. This group of voters say they are supporting Trump because of a blend of ideals that his candidacy represents: as the new flag bearer for conservative, traditional politics; a political outsider who has chipped away at political correctness; a successful businessman who has consistently reinvented himself to achieve the American dream; and a man sure to deliver them from what they see as the disappointing presidency of Barack Obama . Despite Trump 's anti-immigrant rhetoric, some African immigrants have been dissatisfied with Obama 's middling Africa policy and think real change from an outsider like themselves could make a positive difference for America their own fortunes. Leading this pack is none other than president Obama 's Kenyan half-brother, Malik. The 58-year-old naturalized US citizen, has spoken about his own brother's leadership as ※deep disappointment,§ and said that Trump was ※providing something new and something fresh§ to the American people. Some of the African Trump supporters like Malik have also voiced their concerns about the moral relativism that has pervaded US politics, from abortion rights to marriage equality, to the current debate on transgender bathroom use. I tried to co-exist with my brother Barack Obama but he shut me out; In his Ivory Tower. I gave up. 〞 Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) November 5, 2016 VOTE FOR MR. TRUMP ! Malik already voted. 〞 Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) November 5, 2016 Reno Omokri, once the controversial new media aide to Nigeria's former president, Goodluck Jonathan, is now a pastor in the San Francisco Bay area. Speaking to the BBC, Omokri said that he supports Trump because he was going to nominate a Supreme Court judge who might reverse, or deal, with these issues from a conservative standpoint. ※Those issues, they might seem small to you,§ Omokri said, but they ※are very important to someone like me because I am a conservative and that is why I am supporting Donald Trump .§ Khadra Abdirahman is a 24-year-old Somali-American who was born in New York after her parents fled the civil war in Somalia. But as a registered Republican and a first-time voter, she intends to cast her ballot for a political candidate who is against the status quo. Establishment party leaders she said, are oblivious to the populism born out of frustration, which is why she would vote for a candidate like Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders, instead of Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush. Abdirahman, who didn't support Obama when he ran in 2008 and 2012, thinks the 2016 elections are ※a change election§ and a ※revolutionary election.§ She says the ※surge of anti-establishment, anti-globalist political revolutions,§ the like we have seen with Brexit, should provide the space for candidates like Trump to be elected. ※America projects a false image of goodness and truthfulness and it is actually extremely rotten to the core.§ Sign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief 〞 the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.",

    "text": "Email Print It seems like everyone associated with the Clintons has become immune to common sense. The Obama Justice Department will not do anything to hold this woman accountable, even though far better people than her have had their careers ended over similar crimes. However, the NYPD isn't under Clinton or Obama's control. Erik Prince, Blackwater Founder and Former Navy Seal, told Breitbart what the NYPD's approach might be. According to some of his well-placed sources in the NYPD, Prince told Breitbart the following: ※The NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making [in the Anthony Weiner investigation] but they received ＆huge push back' from the Justice Department.§ as per Breitbart . Why is the NYPD involved in the Clinton case? Well, they weren't originally, but they made the initial discovery of the new Clinton emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop. Judging from the amount of information they found on the laptop, it seems the FBI and the State Department had insiders protecting Clinton. Allegedly, the criminal activity found on that laptop is enough to make Al Capone blush. ※They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,§ Prince said. Prince even gave some insight as to why FBI Director Comey decided to re-open the investigation. In a nutshell, the NYPD forced his hand. ※The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI,§ Prince said. ※They said, ＆We're going to go public with this if you don't reopen the investigation and you don't do the right thing with timely indictments,'§ Prince explained. ※NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,§ Prince elaborated. ※Weiner and Huma Abedin, his wife 每 the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years 每 have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have 每 they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton's own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.§ Allegedly, some of the crimes the emails reveal include money laundering, lying, and even sex trafficking young children. The NYPD doesn't mess around, so they have appointed a new, unbiased, prosecutor in order to investigate these claims by Erik Prince. If only Lynch's Justice Department knew how to make unbiased appointments. The warning for the voters is simple: if Hillary Clinton is elected, there will a constitutional crisis on our hands. She may very well be the first President to be indicted before her first day in the Oval Office. If these criminal accusations are true, they will lead to such staggering events. It would make Watergate seem like a walk in the park. But, its not too late to do the right thing and avoid all of this. Vote Trump and Hillary will be where she belongs 〞 in prison.

    "title": "Clinton Campaign Paid Beyonce and Jay Z $62 Million For Cleveland Concert to Secure Black Votes | EndingFed News Network",
    "text": "Email Print Cleveland, Ohio 每 Beyonce and Jay Z performed for ※free§ at the Get out the Vote concert last night for Hillary Clinton. However, sources revealed that the power couple was paid $62 Million to perform. According to sources closely connected with the power couple, Clinton and her campaign flew Beyonce and Jay Z out to a private meeting to discuss the election. With Hillary lacking the African-American voting numbers that Barack Obama had during his 2008 presidential, the Clinton campaign made a quick and desperate move in their final efforts to secure African-American votes. Empire Herald reported : ※Jay and Beyonce got a call a few weeks ago from Clinton. She invited them for a weekend stay at a luxury hotel to meet regarding the election. Before Jay Z or Beyonce could voice any concerns or ask questions, Hillary pulled out a check. Beyonce saw the check first and her eye lit up like Christmas lights. On the last day of the meeting, Hillary told said to everyone, including Jay Z and Beyonce, ※We definitely got the black vote now.§ On the flight back to New York, Jay Z said, ※You know what, Black Lives Matter, they matter because we got paid $62 Million to represent them.§ Hillary Clinton can officially add Beyonc谷 and Jay Z to her list of devoted supporters. The musical power couple headlined a free get-out-the-vote concert in Cleveland on Friday night. . Cole, Chance The Rapper, and Big Sean were also among the list of artists who performed, offering their support to the Democratic nominee for president. As the concert's official main headliner, Jay-Z kicked off the event with ※Dirt Off Your Shoulder,§ ※F〞WithMeYouKnowIGotIt,§ and a couple of his older hit records. Shawn ※Jay Z§ Carter also brought out Big Sean to perform ※Clique§. After Big Sean, Chance The Rapper, and J. Cole finished, Beyonc谷 made her entrance with her anthemic ※Formation.§ But before ※Freedom§ rang out, she shared her thoughts about the election. ※There was a time when a woman's opinion did not matter. If you were black, white, Mexican, Asian, Muslim, educated, poor, or rich, if you were a woman, it didn't matter,§ Beyonc谷 said. ※Less than 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote. Look how far we've come from having no voice to being on the brink of making history again, by electing the first woman president. But we have to vote. The world looks to us as a progressive country that leads change.§ She continued: ※Eight years ago, I was so inspired to know that my nephew, a young black child, could grow up knowing his dreams could be realized by witnessing a black president. And now, we have the opportunity to create more change. I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and know that her possibilities are limitless. ※We have to think about the future of our daughters, our sons, and vote for someone who cares for them as much as we do,§ she continued, concluding: ※And that is why I'm with her.§ After Beyonce's performance, she and her husband, Jay Z, bowed, hugged, and kissed, ending their night with their official endorsement of Hillary Clinton. then Jay Z made his endorsement. ※I want to grow up in a world where our daughter has no limitations. She can feel like she can be whatever she wants to be in the world,§ he said. ※This other guy [Donald Trump], I don't have any ill will towards him, but his conversation is divisive, and that's not an evolved soul to me. He cannot be my president. He cannot be our president. Once you divide us, you weaken us. We're stronger together,§ Jay Z added. Jay Z then welcomed Hillary Clinton on stage and, along with Beyonc谷, gave the 69-year-old politician a big hug. Then, the former Secretary of State grabbed the mic. ※We have a woman who is an inspiration to so many others. I thank Beyonc谷 for standing up and showing the world we are strongest when we look out for each other,§ Clinton said. ※And I thank Jay for addressing in his music some of our biggest challenges in the country: poverty, racism, the urgent end for criminal justice reform.§ \nIf you haven't checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so.

    "text": "Archives Michael's Latest Video Let's Be Clear 每 A Vote For Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For World War 3 By   26th, 2016 \nIf you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as ※dangerous§ and ※temperamental§, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. \nSomeone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are ※going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton§＃ \nOn Syria's civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. \nClinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ※safe zones§ on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. \n※What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,§ said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. ※You're going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.§ \nIn order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. \nAnd in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. \nAccording to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences＃ \nRussia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. \n※I wouldn't put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,§ Clapper said, speaking with CBS' Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. \nOf course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria ※would require us to go to war§ ＃ \n※Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,＃ That's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not going to make.§ ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) \nBut Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. \nYou see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn't for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no ※humanitarian crisis§ in Syria at all. \nThanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won't have anywhere to hide. \nSo the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. \nOne recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates ＃ \n※Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation 每 at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,§ Putin said. \n※Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,§ Putin noted. \nAnyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. \nAnd even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania ＃ Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America's troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. \nIn addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia＃ \nAfter accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. \nA rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. \n※The US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,§ said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen S?reide. \nMost Americans aren't aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. \nBut in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation ＃ \nRussian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. \nAt the Kremlin's Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. \nThe country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. \nI know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. \nIn my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn't know how the election would turn out. \nAt this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. \nIf you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don't do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. \nIf the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years. \nAbout the author: Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream.

    "text": "Archives Michael's Latest Video Did America Really Pass The Test? 每 Hillary Clinton Is Going To Win The Popular Vote By A Wide Margin By Michael Snyder, on November 9th, 2016 \nThe 2016 election was a test, and it would be easy to assume that since Donald Trump won the election that America passed the test. Unfortunately, it may not be that simple. A closer look at the numbers reveals a very sobering reality. Yes, Donald Trump won far more electoral votes than Hillary Clinton did, and that means that he is on track to become our next president . But Hillary Clinton is going to win the popular vote, and it is likely to be by a very wide margin once all the votes are counted. \nAs I write this article, Hillary Clinton has a lead of 218,000 in the popular vote, but most of the votes that have not been counted are on the west coast. \nIn California, Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by a 5,482,166 to 2,966,654 margin, and only 68 percent of the vote has been counted so far. So assuming that the ratio stays about the same the rest of the way, Clinton is going to add at least a million more votes to her lead just from the state of California. \nUp in Washington state, Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by more than 370,000 votes, and only 60 percent of the vote has been counted there so far. So she could easily pick up another 200,000 votes in that state. \nWhen everything is all said and done, it seems very likely that Hillary Clinton will have received well over a million more votes than Donald Trump did in this election. \nSo the truth is that the American people chose Hillary Clinton, but because of some electoral college magic Donald Trump is the winner of the election. \nAnd I am certainly very, very happy that Hillary Clinton is not going to be our next president. Four years under her ※leadership§ would have likely been the final nail in the coffin for our nation. My hope is that she will now disappear from national politics for good. \nBut just because she is not going to be our next president does not mean that we passed the test. \nIn this election, the American people were faced with a very stark choice. Hillary Clinton is the most wicked politician that our country has ever seen, and over the past three decades the American people have gotten to know exactly who she is and what she stands for. \nAnd despite knowing exactly what they would be getting, more Americans voted for her than voted for Donald Trump. \nIf every vote counted equally, she would be our next president. \nI certainly don't mean to rain on the Trump parade. Christians, conservatives and patriots are right to celebrate this victory by Donald Trump. But the truth is that I don't believe that we did actually pass the test that we were faced with. \nAs a nation, we willingly chose Hillary Clinton by a pretty substantial margin. \nAnd don't think that the radical left is going to forget that Trump lost the popular vote. Already, violence and protests have erupted all over the nation. \nShortly after Trump declared victory, riots broke out in Berkeley, San Jose and Oakland ＃ \n※Not my president! Not my president!§ chanted anti-Trump rioters in Berkley, California as they light flares and storm the streets. \nRiots erupted in Berkley, San Jose and Oakland shortly after the announcement of Donald Trump as president-elect. Rioters are breaking into stores, vandalizing cars and shooting flares. \nOne woman in Oakland was hit by a car on Highway 24 just after midnight and has suffered serious injuries after. When she pulled over to the right shoulder, she was surrounded by anti-Trump rioters, who vandalized her car and broke the back window, according to CHP officers. \nThere were reports of protesters burning American flags in some areas of the country, and there were even brawls outside of the White House . \nAnd once the sun set on Wednesday night, the protests started again. According to USA Today , ※thousands of demonstrators§ have hit the streets in New York City＃ \nIn New York, thousands of demonstrators blocked off streets around Trump Tower near the busy intersection of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, chanting ※hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go§ and ※p〞y grabs back,§ a reference to tape of a Trump conversation from years back in which he One woman protester was topless while another climbed on top of a tree to see the activity. Taxis, city buses and passenger vehicles stood at a standstill. \nIn Boston, radical leftists were organizing a giant protest against Trump ＃ \nFar-left organizers are planning a mass protest in Boston against President-elect Donald Trump, citing the need to ※immediately start fighting against him.§ \nApproximately 2,300 people have indicated they will gather outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston tonight for a ※Boston Against Trump Rally.§ According to the Facebook event page, another 5,000 people say they may be interested in attending. \n※Donald Trump is the next President of the United States. We need to immediately start fighting against him. We need to build a movement to fight racism, sexism, and Islamophobia,§ the event description says. \nSadly, this could be the beginning of a new era of protests, rioting and civil unrest. \nInstead of coming together behind the new president, the radical left seems ready to go to war. \nSo even though Trump won the election, the truth is that our troubles may only just be starting. More than half the country didn't want Trump, our nation was already more divided than it has been in decades before he won, and it won't take much for many of our big cities to descend into utter chaos. \nWithout a doubt, we should be very excited that Donald Trump won the election, but an election victory is not going to magically make our problems go away. \nWhen faced with the most monumental election in any of our lifetimes, Hillary Clinton received the most votes from the American people, and the consequences for that decision may be far more severe than most people are now anticipating. \nAbout the author: Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream.

Kara even managed to have a short conversation with the Pope during his visit.",

She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades. \nHillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election, I am fully convinced that World War III will begin before her time in the White House is over. \nSomeone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters, Trump recently stated that we are ※going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton§:",

It hasn't even tried to hide its bias in an attempt to destroy Republican nominee Donald Trump's chances at becoming president.\nOver the weekend, CNN tried desperately to find anything it could to distract the American people from the FBI's announcement that it was reopening the investigation into Clinton's use of an email server while she was secretary of state.\nCNN ran a story on Sunday about a Trump rally in Colorado, only it blatantly lied about what Trump said at the rally in an attempt to smear him, Mediate reported .\nThe article in question originally ran with the headline ※Trump, skeptical of mail-in balloting, encourages voting more than once if necessary.§ Here's a screen grab of the original.\n※If you go to university center, they'll give you a new ballot, they'll void your old ballot, in some places they do that four or five times, so by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in,§ Trump said at the rally, according to CNN's original article.\nHowever there was more to that quote, which CNN decided not to run with.\n※If you go to university center, they'll give you a new ballot, they'll void your old ballot. They'll give you a new ballot, and you can go out and make sure it get's in. Now in some places, they do that four or five times, but we don't do that. So by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in,§ is the full quote of what Trump said.\nBy selectively editing the quote, CNN made it appear that Trump was encouraging voter fraud.\nAfter publishing the original story, CNN changed the headline, and the content, to actually reflect what Trump actually said. Initially, the network did not indicate it had done so. However, a line was later added at the end of the article to indicate it had been changed.\nThe new headline can be seen below:\n\nCNN also took down the tweet that had the incorrect headline.\nMaybe next time CNN will think twice before publishing such blatant lies. Instead of trying to cover up Clinton's corruption, maybe the network should just to its job and report on the news.\nThis is what the media is doing these days, they chop speeches, edit them, falsify them! Let this be a warning to you for any future BS that may come out from the media. No matter how much they hype it. Do NOT believe anything the media tells you!\nYou know what you have to do, go out and vote for Trump! Avoid electronic voting because the machines are owned by George Soros, a Clinton donor, request paper ballot because they are obligated by the law and if they refuse to give you a paper ballot, make a scene, call the cops on them.\nSource",

We have included Twitter hashtags for #DonaldTrump and #HillaryClinton as well as #GaryJohnson and #JillStein. It will reach both sides, thus being fully fair and balanced. Our poll also includes 3rd party candidates Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Voters can only vote once in our poll and their vote cannot be changed.\nThanks to Wikileaks email ID 26551 we now have confirmed data of what we all have long suspected, that polling agencies are being ordered to oversample as much as needed in order to artificially inflate the numbers of a specific candidates which has enough power to pull the strings or is simply preferred by the polling agency.\nMost mainstream media polls only include ※Likely Voters§ nowadays though it hasn't always been like this. According to their definition, Likely Voters means people who also voted in the previous elections. This is not an accurate way to measure the real preference out there because both Trump and Clinton benefit from what is known as first time voters. People who never voted before, people who feel disenfranchised by the system and who simply didn't want to vote before.\nThere is also the Millennial vote which is also impossible to include in the Likely Voters BS the media is pushing. Donald Trump is a revolutionary who vowed to change the system. This has brought millions of new people who never participated in the elections before. Bernie Sanders was also a revolutionary who vowed to do the exact same thing. Bernie lost or better said the election was stolen from him but that's another story. Bernie endorsed Hillary Clinton so, some of his voters have been transferred to Hillary Clinton now. Those first-time Bernie voters are also not included in the Likely Voters polls.\nSo without further due, we present to you our own OPEN POLL where everybody can vote only once. A fair an unbiased poll.\nWho will you vote for in the upcoming US presidential election 2016? Note: There is a poll embedded within this post, please visit the site to participate in this post's poll.",

What's even more shocking is that this interview was conducted on November 4th, 2 days ago so we only learned about it now.

Stein warned, explaining that Clintona?s trigger-happy militarism a?is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen.a?\nWhile Stein adamantly opposes a Trump presidency, she explained that the dangers posed by a Clinton presidency are a?arguably even more immediate and intense.a?\nStein blasted Clintona?s a?warmongeringa? that a?almost singlehandedlya? brought us the turmoil in Libya and could lead us into a nuclear war if Clinton were elected president.\na?Hillary brought us Libya almost singlehandedly,a? Stein explained in a Thursday Fox Business interview. She continued:\nAnd she has said that she will lead the charge with a no-fly zone in Syria, and that basically amounts to a declaration of war against Russia, who is there under international law, having been invited by the sitting government. Like it or not, Russia has the sanction of international law to be there. For us to go in and declare a no-fly zone means get ready for war with Russia. Both of us have 2,000 nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert. This is the most dangerous momenta§ according to the former president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, who, two weeks ago, said this is the most dangerous nuclear moment ever.\nStein elaborated on this view during a Facebook Live interview with progressive Marc Lamont Hill, who has endorsed Stein over Clinton: a?In this election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,a? Stein said, adding:\nNot only in regards to climate, not only in regards to these expanding wars where Hillary has this proven track record a? of the most pro-conflict military policy as possible, and shea?s calling for a no-fly zone in Syria, which means wea?re essentially declaring war on Russia if Hillary gets electeda※declaring war on Russia at a time when we have 2,000 nuclear weapons between us and the Russians on hair trigger alert. This is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen. So ita?s really important right now for us to stand up and start building a force to do the right thing.\na?No one should fool themselves into thinking that the dangers will be smaller, that they will be mitigated in any way for having Hillary in White House. In some ways, theya?re arguably even more immediate and intense,a? Stein said. a?But the dangers will be mitigated if we have created a strong force and we stand up loud and clear and we have a political base for this social movement that is coming together across this country and, really, across the worlda※this movement that puts people, planet, and peace over profit.a?\na?Ita?s very clear what kind of a trend wea?re on,a? Stein explained:\nThis is a race to the bottom between the greater and lesser evil. Where is the exit strategy if you buy into this [idea that one must vote for one of the major parties]? It means that in every election, we have two candidates that are more corporatist, more militarist, more imperialist, more economic elites, more serving Wall Street, offshoring our jobs, more of these rigged corporate trade agreements, more of this climate policy. a? There is no exit strategy if you buy into the lesser evil. It means with each race, we come closer and closer to the cliff.\na?We must find and elect alternatives to the Wall Street-backed oligarchy, the warmongers, and the anti-humanitarians,a? Stein wrote on Twitter.\nStein, who has previously described Clinton as a?Queen of corruption,a? attacked Clinton for her questionable ties to Qatar and Saudi Arabia:\nDuring her interview with Stein, Fox Business host Kennedy blasted other members of the mainstream media for ignoring and trying to a?smothera? Steina?s a?authentica? and a?interestinga? candidacy.\na?Ia?m surprised that the mainstream media has taken an interesting, authentic candidate like yourselfa§ they were so obsessed with Bernie Sandersa§ and youa?ve got someone, the embodiment of this new and interesting political tapestry, and theya?ve essentially ignored you and smothered your candidacy,a? Kennedy said.\nStein agreed and said that the corporate mediaa?s blackout of her campaign and their perpetuation a?speaks volumes.a? She said, a?My campaign is a very inconvenient truth that there is a politics of integrity out there. a? Every day, there are more revelations how both a? [Trump and Clinton] are walking, talking scandal machines, and people are clamoring for something else.a? She added, a?The corporate media, the apologists for the Democrats and Republicans, and the political pundits are doing everything they can to intimidate people into voting for the system thata?s throwing them under the bus.a?\nSource",

    "text": "In a video released by Project Veritas, James Oa?Keefe exposes what everyone except Democrats have known to be true. There is a lot of voter fraud.\nIn the video, NYC Democratic Commissioner of the Board of Elections Alan Schulkin is caught on hidden camera at a United Federation of Teachers holiday party admitting that there is widespread voter fraud in New York City.\na?Yeah, they should ask for your ID. I think there is a lot of voter fraud,a? said Schulkin, who elaborated on the types of voter fraud that are taking place in New York.\nVoter fraud has been labeled as a right-wing myth by the left, but Schulkin, a Democrat, confirmed everyonea?s worst fears, going against the grain of his own party.\na?You know, I dona?t think ita?s too much to ask somebody to show some kind of an IDa?Like I say, people dona?t realize, certain neighborhoods in particular they bus people around to vote,a? said Schulkin.\nWhen asked about which type of neighborhoods the busing of voters takes place in, Schulkin confirmed that it was minority neighborhoods, adding, a?they get busses and they move people around.a?\nSchulkin expressed concern over voter fraud and suggested that Mayor Bill de Blasio was to blame for a lot of the voter fraud taking place in New York City.\na?He gave out ID cards. De Blasio. Thata?s in lieu of a drivera?s license, but you can use it for anything. But, they didna?t vet people to see who they really are. Anybody can go in there and say I am Joe Smith, I want an ID card. Ita?s absurd. Therea?s a lot of fraud. Not just voter fraud, all kinds of fraud.a?\nDespite having disapproval with de Blasioa?s faulty ID program and widespread voter fraud, Schulkin also expressed concerns over safety in the polling locations as well as the potential for voter fraud, specifically with regards to Muslims wearing burkas.\na?They detonate bombs in the public schools, which we are using. That could disrupt the whole electiona?Your vote doesna?t even count, because they can go in there with a burka and you dona?t know if they are a voter.a?\nIt is clear after listening to a New York City Democratic Election Commissioner that the Democrats are in denial of the fraud that surrounds them. Schulkin confirms that voter ID laws are something that New York City desperately needs as a way to curb voter fraud.\nSource",

    "text": "Shocking video out of Chicago shows a mob of young black men viciously beating an older white man because he voted for Donald Trump, dragging him through the streets as he hangs out of the back of his car.\nThe clip shows the thugs repeatedly screaming, ※you voted Donald Trump§ as they assault the victim from every angle while others steal his belongings.\n※You voted Trump,§ the mob screams, ※You gonna pay for that sh*t.§\nAnother woman shouts ※beat his ass,§ while another man is heard laughing before remarking, ※Don't vote Trump.§\nA second video of the incident which is dubbed with the ※F**k Donald Trump§ song, a phrase now being chanted by ※protesters§ across the country, shows one of the attackers driving away in the man's vehicle while his hand is still stuck in the window as the car drags him down the street.\n※The scene is frankly reminiscent of a lynching,§ remarks Chris Menahan .\nIt is not even clear if the victim was a Trump supporter. Presumably, the mob used that as an excuse to beat and rob him.\nYouTube quickly deleted the video, but it has been mirrored on numerous different websites.\nIf the roles had been reversed, and Trump supporters had been caught on tape viciously beating a black Hillary voter, this would be a national news story right now.\nThis is simply unacceptable \nAs it is, you won't see this on CNN any time soon. Perhaps blacks should also be deported to Africa＃ they never seem to be satisfied, no one ever seems to make them happy. They even rioted and protested during Obama, with one of their own as president. Black Lives Matter was formed during Obama.\nBesides maybe us whites are bad with them and misbehave with them, sometimes willingly and purposefully while other times by mistake. So it would be best if we separate so that we don't have these ancient conflicts anymore. This man who was beaten so badly never did anything wrong to these people, neither willingly nor unwillingly but these conflicts still happen because we are not compatible with each other.\nAfter all first Republican president Abraham Lincoln believed in separation , he freed them from slavery but he also said:\nI will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black races 每 that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything.\nNow we do disagree with Lincoln's idea of superior-inferior relationship. It would however be best to separate though. It just doesn't work. Despite having almost 2 centuries now since the Emancipation Proclamation, conflicts still run rampant and no real friendship has ever been established. They should be resettled perhaps to Liberia, a plan supported by Abraham Lincoln and be helped financially with billions or even trillions of dollars until they can start their own economy and industry. They do deserve that. Anyone intermarried with them should be free to either stay in the US and divorce or simply go along with their families.\nSource",

Etc. Etc. But alas a non Oligarch got the nomination, what to do before all is lost and we're exposed, ok fellow Oligarchs we'll get the media behind us they'll feed the ※Useful Idiots§ what we tell them to, this will work. Bush is a globalist, his father is a globalist, so are all the Democrats and RINOs. In my opinion JFK was the last Democrat president who loved his country, he almost died for it in WW2 and did die because he wouldn't go along with the shadow government. Ronald Reagan was the last Republican that loved his country, he too almost died because of it, the Shadow Government that controls this world I call Satan's Elite forces, they are in the process of setting up a world government by using Madmen from the Middle East to create Chaos. As a Christian I believe what the Prophet Daniel was told and that is the dark forces of Satan can get control of man's governments, this world government will come about, the good news it will be destroyed along with the evil people who created it. Interestingly one of the names of that man we call the Antichrist [The Scriptures do Not] can be translated as ※The Man of Chaos§",

    "title": "Comment on Predetermined vote counts show Nov. 8 presidential election is rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton by Anonymous",
    "text": "Dr. Eowyn | 2 Comments WARNING: \nThis post may be the most important post you'll read on not just the 2016 election, but the entire electoral system that legitimates the U.S. republic of representative democracy. The post is long, with multiple sections, so pace yourself accordingly. I suggest you bookmark this webpage so that you can return to read or re-read. ? \nJim Stone first posted about this two days ago on Nov. 1, 2016. \nUnsure about Stone, who calls himself an ※independent journalist§ (based in Japan) and who writes in a less-than-clear or reader-friendly manner, I refrained from writing about his post. \nThen InfoWars picked this issue up a day later on November 2. \nWhat is claimed is that a hidden web site of NBC affiliate WRCBtv in Chattanooga, Tenn., shows pre-determined final vote counts for an election that hasn't yet occurred 〞 the 2016 presidential election scheduled for November 8. \nBelow is a screenshot Jim Stone took of the election results on WRCBtv's hidden webpage, showing Hillary Clinton winning with 343 electoral votes and 42% of the popular vote . As Stone puts it: ※SCAM ELECTION ALREADY CONFIRMED. TRUMP LOSES.§ \nStone and InfoWars say the predetermined election results are provided by Worldnow.com. \nSo what is WorldNow? \nThis is what Wikipedia says, with a lot of jargon: \n※WorldNow is a New York-based software company . . . [that] offers the only integrated media platform enabling broadcasters, operators and media companies to easily create, acquire, manage, analyze, monetize and distribute media assets (text, images and videos) across all digital platforms and on-air systems in a unified, end-to-end workflow . . . . Worldnow's customers include CBS, COX, Dispatch, Fox Television, Meredith Corporation, Media General and Raycom Media . . . . On July 29, 2015, WorldNow announced its sale to Frankly, a San Francisco-based provider of white label social media services and mobile messaging apps . . . . In 2012, Fox Television Stations migrated its websites to WorldNow's platform . . . becoming WorldNow's second largest client (as of 2015, they have since switched to Lakana). In 2011, Meredith Corporation . . . began a four-year contract with WorldNow to operate its station websites. In January 2013, Media General reached a deal to move its eighteen stations to WorldNow, beginning with WFLA-TV.§ \nA ※media platform§ is a ※platform,§ medium or means of communicating news, such as a newspaper, TV station, Facebook , Twitter , or even a blog like FOTM . \nI typed ※worldnow.com§ in the URL bar of my laptop, but was brought to the webpage of Frankly Inc. with this URL: http://franklyinc.com/ . \nFrankly's ※About§ page says: \nWorldNow , the original broadcast arm of Frankly, was founded in 1999. We now serve over 200 stations across the United States as a true partner, offering customization services and strategic trainings on industry best practices for user engagement and monetization. \nFrankly's ※Investors§ page says: \n※ Our customers include NBC, ABC, CBS and FOX affiliates , as well as top fashion brands, professional sports franchises and global organizations.§ \nIn other words, WorldNow is a media software company that provides real-time data 每 such as election results 每 to local TV news stations like WRCBtv . \nYou can verify this for yourself by going on WRCBtv's website: http://www.wrcbtv.com/ . Scroll down to the bottom of WRCBtv's webpage, and you'll see this in the bottom left of the webpage: \nWRCBtv.com is ※powered by frankly§ and Frankly is the owner of WorldNow. In other words, WorldNow provides the content or the news for WRCBtv.com. \nStone claims that for now, WRCBtv.com's (predetermined) election results page is hidden, awaiting WorldNow to publicly post the (fake) election results sometime in the evening of November 8, Election Day. \nI can verify that the webpage is currently hidden. Here's what I did: I typed ※ftpcontent2.worldnow.com/wrcb/elections/elections.html§in the URL bar, but was brought to a McAfee Web Advisor page warning of ※Trouble ahead§ and asking me§Are you sure you want to go there?§ I then did a Yahoo search for ※WRCBtv.com decision 2016§. My search's results page has this at the top: \nNote that it says ※Decision 2016: Complete Election Results Posted§. I clicked the blue-colored ※ DECISION 2016: Complete Election Results § and was brought to this page of WRCBtv.com with the message: Our Apologies \nThe page you requested is currently unavailable. Pages on this site are constantly being revised, updated, and occasionally removed. You may have followed an outdated link or have outdated pages in your browser cache. Here's a screenshot I took: \nSo how did WorldNow come up with its predetermined final vote counts for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ? \nAnswer : A method called ※ fractional vote ※. \nTo begin, a fractional vote feature is embedded in the GEMS election management system of electronic voting machines , which counts approximately 25% of all votes in the United States. \nAs explained by Gun&Game , the fractional vote feature can be used to invisibly, yet radically, alter election outcomes by pre-setting desired vote percentages for the candidates. The tampering can be applied across large jurisdictions in less than 60 seconds; is not visible to election observers, even if they are standing in the room and watching the computer; and is unlikely to be detected by auditing or canvass procedures. \nGEMS vote-counting systems operate under five trade names: Global Election Systems, Diebold Election Systems, Premier Election Systems, Dominion Voting Systems, and Election Systems & Software, in addition to a number of private regional subcontractors. GEMS is used statewide in Alaska, Connecticut, Georgia, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Utah and Vermont, and for counties in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. It is also used in Canada. \nVote-rigging by electronic voting machines is real. \nA 2006 Emmy-nominated HBO documentary, Hacking Democracy , investigates the flawed integrity of electronic voting machines, particularly those made by Diebold Election Systems (now Global Election Systems), and exposes previously unknown backdoors in the Diebold trade secret computer software. Hacking Democracy documents American citizens investigating anomalies and irregularities with electronic voting systems during the 2000 and 2004 elections, especially in Volusia County, Florida. The film culminates in the on-camera hacking of the Diebold election system in Leon County, Florida 〞 the same computer voting system which has been used in elections across 39 states, and which still counts tens of millions of America's votes today. \nSo what is fractional or fractionalized vote? \nFractional vote is a method to distort the results of an election by ※weighting§ the votes. Instead of the principle of ※one person-one vote,§ some votes are counted not as 1, but as a fraction of or less than 1 (e.g., ? or ?), or as more than 1 (e.g., 1? or 1?). The distortion of ※one person-one vote§ is in order to achieve a pre-assigned percentage of votes for each candidate. For example, Candidate A is pre-assigned 51% of the votes, Candidate B 44%, and Candidate C gets the rest 〞 5%. \nAn algorithm is used to arrive at the pre-assigned percentages by changing the numbers automatically as the voting progresses. Although Candidate A in actuality received fewer number of votes than Candidate B, by ※weighting§ Candidate A's votes, those votes are distorted in value, with one vote being counted, say, 25 times, so that Candidate A is the winner. And although Candidate B actually received more votes than Candidate A, Candidate B's votes are ※weighted§ such that their values are less, with some votes converted to zero. The end result is that Candidate B loses. \nAccording to Jim Stone, below are the numerical votes and percentages that are the pre-assigned presidential election results for the various states , which are already on the ※Election Results§ webpage of WMCtv.com, a local TV station in Memphis, TN. (But if you go onto that webpage 〞 http://ftpcontent4.worldnow.com/wmctv/elections/wmc-electionresults.html 〞 now, all the values are 0): \nLine 119: US President Alabama Line 121: Donald Trump (R)

of election results on November 8, Jim Stone says that he'd ※ripped the code out worldnow.com/kfvs12/elections.html§ and can confirm ※there is no active in it to need testing,\" i.e., \"the page has no code that will tabulate votes.\" The data on the hidden page are not codes, but are \"all just typed in.\" \nThere is another way to demonstrate vote rigging of the 2016 election -- a webpage on election results of KFVS12 , a local TV station in Cape Girardeau, MO: http://82.221.129.208/ftpcontent4worldnowcomkfvs12elections.html . \nThe webpage at present is a fakery in progress , with the final (fake) vote counts for some races already filled in, but blank for some other races. This afternoon, November 3, 2016, I took screenshots of every race with (fake) tabulations already filled in, but did not take screenshots of some blank races because I got tired of taking screenshots. The races with no (fake) vote counts are all minor races, such as those for city councils and local initiatives. \nAsk yourself this question: \nWhy would the website of KFVS12, a local TV station in Missouri, have the final vote counts for some races in the upcoming November 8 elections already filled in? \nIf KFVS12's election results webpage as it is now is merely a \"test-run\" to ensure that the webpage will be operative on November 8, why are the vote counts of some races -- all relatively unimportant local races -- blank? If the page is a \"test,\" there should be \"test\" vote counts for every race. \nCan anyone offer another explanation for what's been presented in this post? I'm open to alternative, non-election-fraud explanations. \nIs our entire democratic polity an illusion? \nH/t FOTM 's bongiornoc",

    "title": "My Appeal to Leftists Who Won't Vote or Who Believe Voting Third Party Is a Principled Stance",
    "text": "By Chad Kautzer / filmsforaction.org \nMy appeal to leftist comrades who think that not voting is a way to be a \"principled\" leftist, or that it's leftist to choose a third-party candidate so you can vote in good conscience. These are not leftist positions (Yes, I dare to assert a basic standard for distinguishing liberal and Leftist positions). \nIt would be leftist to organize a boycott of the vote, so that abstention was a collective act with a clear and practical goal. It would also be leftist to vote for a third-party candidate if it furthered a leftist project. Currently, neither of these is the case, so we can take them off the table. \nLiberals are committed to an electoral system of politics and believe that politicians should \"represent\" their will. Indeed, many liberals want to completely identify with their candidates. This leads liberals to talk about voting their conscience or abstaining because they don't want to have to choose between the lessor of two evils. The liberal illusion is that it could ever be otherwise (next time we'll have candidates we can believe in!). \nElections are always a choice between evils, but elections are only one component of leftist politics. We choose the candidates who will do the least amount of harm to our larger projects for radical change. And after voting, we get on with those projects - mobilizing at the grassroots, educating and organizing against oppression, capacitating our communities, and constantly challenging ourselves to be better friends and comrades. \nWhen we vote, we do not endorse liberalism and we are not morally compromised (as liberals would assert). We are using whatever resources are available to us to realize leftist goals and sometimes that means little more than choosing a politician who represents the least opposition to those goals. \nSo, leftist comrades, I say this with love: let's shake off the liberal moralism of electoral politics and focus on what best enables the achievement of practical, leftist projects.

    "title": "A Vote For Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For World War 3",
    "text": "Print \nIf you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as ※dangerous§ and ※temperamental§, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. \nSomeone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are ※going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton§＃ \nOn Syria's civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. \nClinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ※safe zones§ on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. \n※What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,§ said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. ※You're going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.§ \nIn order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. \nAnd in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. \nAccording to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences＃ \nRussia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. \n※I wouldn't put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,§ Clapper said, speaking with CBS' Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. \nOf course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria ※would require us to go to war§ ＃ \n※Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,＃ That's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not going to make.§ ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) \nBut Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. \nYou see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn't for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no ※humanitarian crisis§ in Syria at all. \nThanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won't have anywhere to hide. \nSo the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. \nOne recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates ＃ \n※Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation 每 at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,§ Putin said. \n※Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,§ Putin noted. \nAnyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. \nAnd even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania ＃ Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America's troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. \nIn addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia＃ \nAfter accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. \nA rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. \n※The US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,§ said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen S?reide. \nMost Americans aren't aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. \nBut in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation ＃ \nRussian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. \nAt the Kremlin's Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. \nThe country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. \nI know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. \nIn my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn't know how the election would turn out. \nAt this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. \nIf you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don't do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. \nIf the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years. \nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare shares",

    "text": "Email \nAmong the many Wikileaks emails that were dumped this summer, it was clear that Hillary Clinton is not as popular as the media would have you believe. In fact, it became clear that she has no real support in a hacked email to the point where she was forced to pay young voters to stump online for her. \nThe Gateway Pundit reported : \nShe's the astroturfed candidate. Hillary is SOOO unpopular that she has to pay off young voters to support her and show up at her rallies. \n5 Biggest Scoops from the #DNCLeaks WikiLeak \nWikileaks released nearly 20,000 hacked emails it says are from the accounts of Democratic National Committee officials on Friday. \nThe emails are devastating for Hillary Clinton.

She also pays millennials to show up at her rallies. \nHillary's support is all a lie. It's all astroturfed.

The majority of those were reporters! \nHillary Clinton only has the backing of the media and rabid anti-American liberals, and even then, it looks like she's having to pay them to actually do anything to support her. In other words, her candidacy is completely contrived.",

However, since the t-shirt did not violate the election code, he refused to turn it inside out nor remove it. \nSubsequently, he was arrested and charged with electioneering. \nKSAT 12 reports : \nBulverde police Chief Gary Haecker confirmed the arrest but declined to release details. Instead, he deferred to Comal County's election coordinator, Cynthia Jaqua. \nJaqua said the offense of electioneering isn't limited to people who stand outside polling places holding signs. Violations can be committed by voters as well. \n\"It can mean a T-shirt, a button, a hat, you know?\" she said. \"Anything related to the voting, the party, the candidate.\" \nJaqua declined to release specific details about Mauthe's arrest. \nJaqua is quoted by My San Antonio : \nIt's in the election code. Electioneering is prohibited within a 100-foot marker. You cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons, T-shirts, hats, whatever else or carrying signs,\" she said. \nMost people who make the mistake manage to avoid going to jail, she added. \n\"Every election we have to advise people. Even if it's a school bond issue. They wear candidates' shirts and we just have to remind them. 'Please go into the restroom and turn it inside out.' This is the first time I recall someone getting arrested,\" she said, during two decades working at the county election office. \n\"A gentleman did walk in a little while ago with a slogan for Trump, and when I asked him to please take it off, he was real nice, and took it off,\" she added, while working a polling site Thursday afternoon in New Braunfels. \nSo, according to this nonsense, a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day, but if a politician make reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day? This is utterly ridiculous. \nMy question on all of that is, what happened to free speech? Is that recognized as a God-given right in the First Amendment? I mean, I realize that the Constitution is to restrict the federal government, but honestly, shouldn't the states recognize the right of free speech, even in a polling place? Seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected. \nOther voters agree with me. \n\"I don't feel like you should be preaching to anybody, but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate,\" Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote. \"I'm kind of shocked, because I think that's part of the freedoms that we're voting for.\" \nJose Tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are 18 and vote. Again, I ask, why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech? It's not inflammatory. It isn't a lie. It isn't slander. What's illegal about it? \nI'll tell you, politicians want to control people, and this is one of many means they use to do that. This is what happens when you don't hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose. \nMauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media. \n\"The reason I'm not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around, and I don't want to give you any comment,\" he said . \nThe charged of electioneering is a class C misdemeanor.

    "text": "Dead Coloradans are Lining Up to Vote for Hillary. Is the zombie apocalypse upon us? \nAccording to a report by the Washington Examiner , \nLocal officials in Colorado acknowledged ※very serious§ voter fraud after learning of votes cast in multiple elections under the named of recently-deceased residents. \nA local media outlet uncovered the fraud by comparing voting history databases in the state with federal government death records . ※Somebody was able to cast a vote that was not theirs to cast,§ El Paso County Clerk and Recorder Chuck Broerman told CBS4 while discussing what he called a ※very serious§ pattern of people mailing in ballots on behalf of the dead. \nIt's not clear how many fraudulent ballots have been submitted in recent years. CBS4 reported that it ※found multiple cases§ of dead people voting around the state, revelations that have provoked state criminal investigations. \nThere are dozens of documented examples of dead people voting and they can be found all over the internet. \nOne thing is for certain. \nThe Clinton operatives seem to believe in the old adage＃ if you ain't cheatin' you ain't tryin'＃ On October 1st it was reported ※Young Virginia Democrat Andrew Spieles confessed this week to registering 19 dead people to vote for Hillary.§ \nYou can't stop these people. You can call the election rigged if you want, but how can we argue with people who have the power to summon the dead? \nWhen I die, I plan to vote conservative. \nOK, my attempts to be humorous are often lost in an overcrowded sea of stupidity. This would not seem to be the exception. \nThe only good Hillary voters are obviously the dead ones , because at least they have plausible deniability.

    "text": "Obama Votes Against US at UN October 27, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nObama's abstention from a UN vote against the US is a new low for the most anti-American administration in American history. Under Obama, our foreign policy has been reoriented toward damaging our own interests as much as possible. But actively opposing US policy at the UN is a new low. \nThe resolution A/RES/71/5 is on the \"Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba\". \nIt was introduced at the request of Cuba back in '91 with a memorandum that accused America of \"pursuing an aggressive policy against Cuba with the declared aim of imposing on it the political, social and economic order which the united States authorities consider most fitting. This policy has included direct military intervention, the threat of nuclear annihilation, the instigation and carrying out of countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate Cuban leaders.\" \nAs Obama's creepy toady Ben Rhodes tweeted, \"No reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose.\" \nExcept the failed policy is that of the United States. By \"we\", Rhodes means that Obama and the left aren't going to defend the United States in international forums when they disagree with the US. \nAll this is yet another reminder that the people running the country are not of the country. They're a hostile foreign ideology that sees itself as separate from the United States and does not believe it has any responsibilities toward the United States. \nAt the UN, Samantha Power took the anti-American positions to applause from a UN united with Obama against America. \n\"For more than 50 years, the United States had a policy aimed at isolating the government of Cuba. For roughly half of those years, UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain. [Applause.] Thank you. \" \nThis is treason.",

    "text": "Obama Won't Vote With America at the UN Under Obama, the United States won't defend the United States. November 1, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nDaniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \nA generation ago the Communist tyranny in Cuba demanded that the United Nations condemn America for the embargo. The brutal Castro regime's rant accused the United States of threatening ※nuclear annihilation,§ ※countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate Cuban leaders.§ \nOn a cold day in October, the European left-wing activist serving as UN Ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the US at the UN. \n\"UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain,\" Samantha Power said. \n\"Thank you,\" she added, acknowledging the applause. \nUnder Obama, the United States would no longer defend the United States. A generation ago the Communists had been in Cuba. Now they were in Washington D.C. \nInstead of defending America, Obama's chosen representative agreed that our Communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy. \n※Let me be among the first to acknowledge 每 as our Cuban counterparts often point out 每 that the United States has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens. And we know that at times in our history, U.S. leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust,§ she said. \nIf the Cuban representative had been in her place, he could not have done much better. Communist Cuban propaganda was now being parroted by Ambassador Power. If the Castro dictatorship wanted to save money, it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to Washington D.C. \nThe Cuban ambassador boasted that Cuban Communists had ※rid ourselves of US imperialism§ and proclaimed that, ※We will never go back to capitalism.§ He declared that the resolution was a powerful message to ※the peoples of the world.§ The message is indeed unmistakable. \nBen Rhodes, the close Obama adviser who sold the media on the Iran sellout, curtly tweeted his justification, ※No reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose.§ \nWho is this ※we§? \nThe Cuban embargo is the ※law of the land§. It's the official policy of the United States. It's based on laws passed by Congress and implemented by President John F. Kennedy and his successors. \nThis ※we§ certainly isn't the United States government, its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one. \nOne member of the ※we§ must be Ben Rhodes because he tells us so. Who is Rhodes? An ※aspiring§ novelist who pushed Obama to back the Muslim Brotherhood takeover of Egypt, the Iran nuke sellout and now, apparently, choosing Communist Cuba over America. \nNo one has ever elected Rhodes to anything, but under left-wing rule, he outweighs Congress, President Kennedy, the law of the land and the national interests of the United States. \n※We§ is Obama who made the final decision. It's Ambassador Samantha Power. It's a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their power from a single elected official who is only one third of the government. This is the ※we§ that announced its treasonous opposition to the US at the UN. \nAmerica has a ※we§ problem. \nIf the ※we§ of the American left wants to vote its own way, it should secede to form its own country. \nWhen President John F. Kennedy proclaimed the ※Embargo on All Trade with Cuba§, he based it on authorization from ※the Congress of the United States§. That is how our system used to work. \nThese days El Teleprompte in D.C. decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with Iran, mandate transgender bathrooms, legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in Havana and he does so on his own authority. And Congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists. \nThat's not how America is supposed to work. That's how Iran works. That's how Cuba works. \nThe first word in the introduction to Obama's Presidential Policy Directive on Cuba after the date was ※I§. Obama's basis for his authority is his 2014 announcement. L'etat c'est moi. Obama is the State. \nJFK, no humble shrinking violet, mentions ※I§ only in the fourth paragraph, after Congress. What is the context of Kennedy's ※I§? ※Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority of section 620(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.§ \nThe ※I§ of JFK can only act as a servant, not a master. \nIn Obama's ※Directive§, Congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism. There is no source of authorization for anything other than Barack Obama. There is no law. Only Obama. \nNow the big ※we§ in Washington have decided that they will oppose America at the United Nations. But Ben Rhodes, who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives, made an unfortunate slip. Obama has been accused of Louis XIV's L'etat c'est moi mentality. But Ben Rhodes isn't saying, ※We are the state§. Instead he tells us that there are two powerful political entities in America. One is US. The other is We. \n※We§ does not yet entirely control the state. But ※we§ also feels no obligation to the United States. If ※we§ agrees with America, then ※we§ will vote with it at the UN. If ※we§ opposes America, then ※we§ votes against it. ※We§ will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests. Not ours. \n※We§ happens to run America. But it isn't America. It's the parasite humped on America's back. \nYou can call ※we§ by many names. Deep State is one. It's a coalition of left-wing special interests networking through politics, the non-profit sector and media corporations to control America. \nPresident Kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy . ※We are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice.§ \nKennedy was speaking after the recent Bay of Pigs crisis. The Foreign Assistance Act, mentioned by him, was passed by Congress that year. While the Cuban embargo limited the ability of the Castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world, it didn't stop the ※we§ in Washington D.C. \nIt is easy to sit here in the distant future of 2016 and wonder whether Cuba matters at all. But the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the Cold War. That struggle did not end when the Berlin Wall fell. It is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by ※We the People§ or by the nameless ※We§ of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the Nomenklatura of the left. \nBy backing away from America at the United Nations, the ※we§ have announced their independence from the laws, responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked. \nBut the ※we§ offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule. Instead they impose on us the collectivism of Yevgeny Zamyatin's novel ※We§ in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the One State that controls every aspect of human life. That novel inspired 1984. \nWhat ※we§ offer us is what Cuba's Castro, We's One State and every Communist regime offer us. It's what George Orwell in 1984 summed up as, ※A boot stamping on a human face 〞 forever.§ \nPresident Kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the ※one hundred and eighty-sixth§ year of ※the Independence of the United States of America.§ At the United Nations, Ambassador Power cheerfully declared America's enforced submission to the Communist demands for Cuba. \nThe Cuban people show no signs of winning independence from their Communist overlords. The question is will the United States of America be able to regain its independence from the ※we§?",

    "text": "Black Voters Not Turning Out for Hillary November 2,   \nBlack voters helped Hillary beat Bernie, but they're not turning out for her in early voting . Neither are millennials. \nAfter Sunday night's polls closed, black vot ers accounted for 16 percent of the in-person early vote ballots cast. And that included five previous days of in-person early voting. \nBut in 2012, in just two days of in-person early voting, blacks cast 25 percent of those early ballots, according to Dan Smith, a University of Florida political science professor who published some of the early voting data on his must-read Election Smith blog. \nDue to such strong African-American turnout after the beginning of in-person early voting in 2012, Democrats began outpacing Republicans in total ballots cast before Election Day, by about 10,000. This year, though, Republicans still cling to their own lead of about 9,000. As of Monday morning about 3.7 million absentee and in-person early ballots had been cast, 40.5 percent of them by Republicans and 40.2 percent by Democrats. \nHillary is getting Latino support, largely due to the immigration debate, but she just doesn't have the hot sauce draw that her husband and Obama did. That leaves her more dependent on white voters and forces her to zigzag between moderate and extreme positions. Which only adds to her reputation for untrustworthiness.",

GEORGE SOROS: TRUMP WILL WIN POPULAR VOTE IN ＆LANDSLIDE,' HILLARY'S ELECTORAL VICTORY IS ALREADY ＆A DONE DEAL' GEORGE SOROS: TRUMP WILL WIN POPULAR VOTE IN ＆LANDSLIDE,' HILLARY'S ELECTORAL VICTORY IS ALREADY ＆A DONE DEAL' 0 SHARES \nEven Republican politicians and former politicians are telling Trump to knock off such talk . \nBut, as usual, Trump's shrewdness and defiance of standard political decorum 每 in which the ※opposition§ party merely rolls over and surrenders in the face of Democratic pressure 每 is winning the day. \nNone other than billionaire investor and longtime Democratic supporter George Soros has said that the fix is literally in for the election, in favor of Clinton 每 no matter how much of the popular vote, and from which battleground states, Trump captures. \nAs reported by Top Right News and other outlets, during a recent interview with Bloomberg News , Soros 每 a Democrat mega-donor 每 openly admitted that Trump will win the popular vote in a ※landslide.§ \nHowever, he said that none of that would matter, because a President Hillary Clinton is already a ※done deal.§ \nIn the interview, which is now going viral, Soros says with certainty that Trump will take the popular vote, despite what the polls say now (which are completely rigged to oversample Democrats ), but not the Electoral College, which will go to Clinton. \nWhen the reporter asks if that is already a ※done deal§ 每 that Clinton will be our next president no matter what 每 Soros says ※yes,§ and nods his head. \nIs Soros just making a prediction out of overconfidence? Or does he truly know something most of us don't know? \nIn a recent column , Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, says that Soros and Democrats have ※bribed electoral college representatives§ in a bid to ※fix§ the election outcome in favor of Clinton. In truth, that would be the only way it could be done, short of massive voter fraud through electronic balloting, as some reports have already claimed . \nAdams further pointed out that Soros was one of the main money men behind the Black Lives Matter movement, which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country 每 some of which has led to the deaths of several officers already. \nSoros also funds left-wing websites and groups that locate, pay and deploy volunteer ※agitators§ at Trump rallies, to start fights and engage in physical violence against Trump supporters (acts that the establishment media then blames on Trump ). \nBut aren't electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that elector's district? No, they're not. Nine-nine percent of electors have done what they're supposed to do throughout our history, but this is no ordinary election \nPer Archives.gov , there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote. Rather, these pledges fall into two categories: State law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political parties. \nIn the past, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution doesn't require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please and, therefore, respective political parties may ※extract pledges from electors to vote for the parties' nominees,§ Archives.gov notes. Some state laws hold that ※faithless electors§ could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid ballot, and could then be replaced by a substitute elector. \n※The Supreme Court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the Constitution. No Elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged,§ said Archives.gov. \nThe site notes that throughout our history, 99 percent of electors have voted as required. But this is no ordinary time, and it's no ordinary election . And Democrats (and the establishment media) have already proven that they will do anything to stop a Trump presidency. Plus, establishment Republicans don't want Trump either, so you can bet they wouldn't balk at or challenge the buying off of electors. Post navigation",

    "text": "※Why I Won't Vote for Hillary Clinton | Evan Edinger§ (but then he changes his mind on that) TO CLOSE : Evan Edlinger will vote for Hillary against Trump because he thinks that whereas Hillary's actual track-record of policies (not mere statements) in public office have been horrific, Trump's bad statements and lack of any track-record in public office at all, make Trump even worse. That's what he thinks. I think it makes Trump better 〞 the better choice 〞 as opposed to the proven evil and catastrophically harmful public official, Hillary Clinton. Edlinger is preferring an evil record as a public official, to no record as a public official. Edlinger fails to make two crucial distinctions: One is that he fails to distinguish between mere political statements, versus actual political policies carried out as a public official (which show Hillary to be a proven neocon and tool of Wall Street); and the other is his failing to distinguish between a bad record in a person's private or business affairs, versus a bad record as an actual public official. Only the bad record as a public official should be absolutely disqualifying 〞 and that's Clinton, not Trump, who has a horrific record as a public official. Trump has no record at all as a public official. Edlinger at 1:30 in his video says that when he contemplates voting for Hillary,§There's always one thing that comes in the way, and that's trust.§ He says he doesn't trust her 〞 but what he doesn't actually ※trust§ is her words; when he says he'll vote for her, he's simply ignoring her actions, he's ignoring the real person-as-a-public-official, the person who is shown and displayed beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever. Proven selfishness in one's private life is bad, but proven selfishness and evil in one's public-office policies (such as ※We came, we saw, he died. Ha, ha!§ ) is utterly disqualifying. I argued in my ※I'm a Bernie Sanders Voter: Here's Why I'll Vote Trump§ , that Trump could possibly turn out to be a progressive President; but, even if he turns out to be a bad President, he won't, on balance, be as horrific as will a President Hillary Clinton. With Trump, there is reason to have some hope for the future of the world; with Clinton, there is reason to expect unprecedented horrors .

    "title": "Vote to Become an ＆Avenger' in a World of Evildoers",
    "text": "In 2012, the movie phenomenon ※The Avengers§ filled theaters across the globe. Commercials, product advertisements, and billboards plastered with this ragtag team of superheroes who somehow forge a relationship to help save humanity from certain destruction at the hands of an evil villain was a fan favorite. The Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Scarlet leaped into action after being convinced by the military genius Mr. Furry. They were able to put aside their differences and work for the greater good. In the end, the world is safe.\nIn the first two weeks, the film raked in over $215 million and instantly confirming the superhero concept of ※The Avengers§ was not so new, in fact, it is sometimes a very common occurrence. During this election season, more than just the presidency is at stake. Although crime, division, malice and wrongdoing seems to be ever-present, instead of wallowing in discouragement voters need to exercise the right to become an avenger in a world of evildoers.\nAfter the computer generated images, million dollar budgets and Hollywood star power are stripped away, an Avenger is simply an individual who takes up the cause of another who is unable to protect himself or herself. In different circles, that person may be referred to as an advocate. At the core of humanity, people should make a choice to operate by the infamous Golden Rule, which is ※Treat others the way you want to be treated.§ By the looks of American culture, it seems many have strayed far away from this simple principle.\nSociety has always been balanced by persons stepping up to the plate to champion causes bigger than themselves. These everyday avengers have come in the form of presidents willing to abolish slavery, pilots flying beyond enemy lines, ministers willing to lock arms and protest on behalf of others for equal rights and even voters who go to the polls to make their voice heard. Society has been privileged to experience them come from diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, and cultures all with the same selfless spirit. They may not have worn a cape but were viewed as ※super§ just the same. During this heated election season, voters possess that same heroic power.\nIn the midst of all the confusion screaming across the fabric of today's society, many would love to function as an avenger but are not sure how. Here are a few places modern-day Avengers have the ability to cast a vote in a world of evil and take action:\nIn the area of women's rights\nIt is not uncommon to see the face of a woman plastered on the cover of business magazines as top CEOs and other company leaders. However, in the broader scope of the country, there are still great strides needed to bring equality across genders. In the United States, women still earn dramatically less than their male counterparts do in Corporate America. First Lady Michelle Obama championed equal pay for equal work on the campaign trail and now organizations such as the National Organization for Women remain on the front line of this issue fighting to make sure the progress achieved in the last sixty years is not in vain. Without the vote, progress does not happen.\nBetter education in underserved communities\nCivil Rights leader and advocate Malcolm X once said, ※Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today.§ This concept has been the foundation for public education in America. The right to receive adequate training to be a productive and prosperous American is the right of every person. Therefore, it is amazing to see certain communities with gross neglect and weak curriculums. These areas lack a voice to speak on their behalf. It is encouraging to see leadership like the Gary Comer College Prep School that shines as a beacon in the Chicago area. Amidst killing and senseless loss of life, this school boasts an excellent attrition rate for high school seniors accepted into college.\nBetter healthcare for all people\nThe country is in the middle of a tug of war. Unfortunately, what is at stake is far greater than bragging rights. The health and welfare of seniors and children hang in the balance of those on Capitol Hill. Whether Obamacare is right or wrong is not as important as the need for dialogue around this issue. On one hand, there are elderly who are struggling with the decision to purchase food or their prescriptions and on the other, there are parents who cannot receive proper care at neighborhood clinics. Parents should not have to wonder if their doctor could afford to keep his doors open when he is the only office in the community. There is an initiative to bring mobile clinics to the heart of areas needing it the most. Armed with immunizations, screening, and dental supplies, they are giving away services free that otherwise would not even happen.\nThe moral of Becoming an Avenger\nNo one promises a cape or a billboard, but everyone has a super ability to step in and relieve the sufferings of others. All it takes to be a real-life Avenger is the choice to fight for the needs of the less fortunate; those without a voice or an advocate. In November do not sit idly by, vote to become an avenger in a world seemingly overtaken by evildoers. Not only does this produce a sense of fulfillment and greatness, it also provides the opportunity to be remembered as a modern-day Avenger. These are only a few of many opportunities for activism, but there are many ways to become an active participant in the goal for change.\nIt may seem small and uneventful, but the vote has a unique power to affect the Oval Office more than Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. For those who have not been privileged to cast an early ballot, pause for the cause and vote, vote, vote on November 8.\nOpinion by Cherese Jackson (Virginia)\nSource:\nLos Angeles Times: The Avengers (movie)\nPhoto Credits:\nTop / Featured Images Courtesy of Pat Loika 每 Flickr License\nInline Image Courtesy of Theresa Thompson 每 Flickr License activism , avengers , vote",

    "text": "November 8, 2016, is election day. On Tuesday, Americans will vote for who will represent them to the world. That would be the position of the most powerful person in the world; President of the United States (POTUS). It is up to every citizen, young and old, to remind people to get out and vote. Support the freedom afforded Americans.\nAlso, there are state elections for senators and representative seats. In fact, there are 270 congressional positions available. Most states have significant measures on the ballots for voters to decide. Some measures include; Marijuana legalization, whether or not to raise taxes, fund bonds to fix the school system, build a stadium.\nVote for POTUS As far as voting for the POTUS goes, the country has found itself more divided than ever before. There are four candidates,\nHillary Clinton , the first female candidate from a major party, Democrat, former first lady, and former secretary of state; Gary Johnson , governor of New Mexico, Libertarian Party; Jill Stein, Green Party, a presidential candidate in 2012; Donald Trump , real estate mogul, reality star, and entrepreneur, Republican. Stein and Johnson are unlikely for two reasons;\nNeither are members of the two primary parties. Neither have numbers in the polls that are in the double digits. Clinton has many good qualities that indicate she would be a strong leader. As the first lady, she understands the pressures of the presidency from watching her husband deal with the job. As the secretary of state, Clinton learned first hand the ins and outs of dealing with foreign affairs and American citizens. In this post, she worked closely with the president. When she was a senator, the Democratic candidate learned how difficult it could be to compromise across the aisle.\nTrump has qualities that may help him should he win. His business acumen and his personality indicate he will be a force to with which to be reckoned. He knows the art of the deal making. The Republican candidate has no political experience short of lobbying for his causes, which could serve him well by understanding how the lobbyists think.\nLesser of Two Evils? Both Clinton and Trump have red marks on their reputations, and they have attacked one another relentlessly since each won their primaries. Whereas, the former's are over a decade old the latter's are current.\nHow does one decide which to choose? What happens if neither wins the majority of the vote? Would it be as simple as whoever garners the highest number?\nStein and Johnson each proclaim they are the better choice for voters over choosing the better of two evils. Their positions are unique and intriguing. The Libertarian ticket may be strong as both the presidential and vice presidential candidates are former governors.\nEarly Voting Numbers As of November 4, there have been at least 37 million ballots cast, according to Business Insider. There are approximately 219 million eligible voters in the U.S. in 2016. Polls indicate a drop in the number who are stated they are definitely casting their ballots; in 2012 the number was 76 percent, and in 2016 it was 69. That leaves 41 percent of registered voters who need to have people, adults, teenagers, and children alike, to push them to get to the polling sites and cast their ballots.\nQuestions about what is on the ballot for individual states can be found on Ballotpedia. A person can choose the see what is on the federal, state, local ballots. Another option would be to go the website for the state's registrar's office. It is important to exercise the freedom to vote.\nBy Cathy Milne\nSources:\nWebsites: Presidential Candidates; Hillary Clinton, Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, and Donald Trump\nBusiness Insider: 37 million people have already voted 〞 here's what the data say\nStatistic Brain: Voting Turnout Statistics\nFeatured Image Courtesy of George Makris' Flickr Page 每 Creative Commons License\nTop Inset Image Courtesy of League of Women's Voters' Flickr Page 每 Creative Commons License\nSecond Inset Image Courtesy of Marcia Cirillo's Flickr Page 每 Creative Commons License\nThird Inset Image Robert Palmer's Flickr Page 每 Creative Commons License\nFourth Inset Image Courtesy of Irish Labour Party's Flickr Page 每 Creative Commons License\nFifth Inset Image Courtesy of Julie Faith's Flickr Page 每 Creative Commons License #CMJournalist , Donald Trump , Get Out the Vote , Hillary Clinton , spot , vote",

    "title": "Are Voters Safe Going to the Polls?",
    "text": "This presidential election is both historical and erratic leaving Americans to wonder if they are safe going to the polls. During a recent rally appearance, Donald Trump was rushed off stage fearing that a protestor was a threat. The fear of violence is understandable in lieu of the passion displayed from both sides throughout the campaign. Several states have sought increased law enforcement patrols near voting locations as they prepare to host thousands of voting hopefuls.\nRecently, U.S. intelligence sources warned that Al-Qaeda might be preparing for potential terrorist attacks in states such as Virginia, Texas, and New York due to the Islamic State's (ISIS) alleged call for the ※slaughter§ of U.S. voters on Election Day. The threat was accompanied by demands for Muslims not participate in the democratic process. A seven-page manifesto titled, ※The Murtadd Vote,§ from the organized militant group read:\nMay Allah make this year's U.S. presidential election a dreadful calamity like no other to have struck America throughout its pathetic history.\nMurtadd is a renouncer who turned his back on Islam. The essay uses lengthy religious arguments in an attempt to justify the alleged attacks. Reportedly, the credibility of the threat has not been established; however, U.S. authorities are taking the threats seriously. Authorities are reviewing information about the potential interest by al-Qaeda to conduct attacks in the U.S. Supposedly, beyond the general locations, there was no specific information on the possible form or targets of attacks. In light of these threats, should Americans feel safe going to the polls? In a countering statement, the FBI said:\nThe counterterrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States.\nThe accuracy of the vote and safety of polling locations continues to be a focus of this political cycle. Despite the claims that some locations are beefing up security, some say they will follow the normal protocol already in place. Turnout is expected to be very high and ※things§ are being done to make sure voters and poll workers are safe. Amid the most contentious presidential election cycle in modern U.S. history, it appears that fears continue to revolve around the potential for violence at the polls. \nMany voters remain baffled that the country has come to this point with the two primary candidates. Will they vote for the non-politician whose controversial actions have led to many leaders within his own party to refuse their support of him? Or will they opt for the Democratic insider who bears the weight of Benghazi and has battled a potential indictment over a huge email scandal? This is a massively disappointing circumstance and a definite concern for many Americans and onlookers around the world.\nThe dislike of both candidates coupled with new threats surrounding the polls have voters questioning their safety. Many first-time voters struggle with the unusual nature of this election season. When questioned, although some were still undecided, they definitely planned to submit their ballot. One first year voter said:\nTo not vote at all is a waste. It is a waste of the right to be a part of our democracy, and it is tantamount to saying you would rather hide and deal with the consequences of others' decisions than to be actively involved yourself.\nAre Americans safe going to the polls? With ongoing concerns about the safety of voters due to the heated election season, some polling places are taking extra measures to ensure safety while voting. There is always some concern about what could occur at a polling location, however, with this election, everyone is expecting record turnout with voters . Several states will respond to the fear of intimidation and alleged threats by increasing security and initiating an ※all hands on deck§ mentality. It is the hope of officials, that this will not hinder the voting process. Remember polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m tomorrow.\nBy Cherese Jackson (Virginia) \nSources:\nZero Hedge : ISIS Calls For ※Slaughter Of Americans§ On Election Day\nNBC Universal: Are San Diego's Polling Places Safe?\n21 Harrisburg: Safety and security top priority at the polls\nPhoto Credits:\nTop Image Courtesy of Stephen Venkman 每 Flickr License\nInline Image Courtesy of BU Interactive News 每 Flickr License\nFeatured Image Courtesy of Maryland GovPics 每 Flickr License    isis , spot , Terrorism , vote , Voting",

This was decided because there was the overall thought that real-time voting information, on Election Day, could sway those who had not yet cast their votes. However, that silence will be broken for the 2016 presidential election.\nVoteCastr will be providing real-time voting data from eight battleground states. This information is being collected using the same techniques as the presidential campaigns.\nAt 3:48 p.m. ET, the voting data was given as follows: Over 83 percent of the expected voters have cast their ballots in Florida. Thus far, Hillary Clinton has 48 percent and Donald Trump has 45 percent of the state.\nIn Colorado, 80 percent of the votes have been counted. Currently, Clinton holds a three-point lead over her Republican opponent.\nMore than 66 percent of the registered voters have cast their ballots in Iowa. At this time, Trump has a narrow lead of 1 percent.\nWisconsin has turned in 62 percent of their votes. Clinton leads with 48 percent of the votes. Trump trails with 43 percent.\nIn Nevada, almost 69 percent of registered voters have cast their ballots. Clinton currently leads by a narrow 1 percent.\nClinton holds a 1 percent lead in Ohio. So far, 74 percent of voters have made their choice.\nOver 63 percent of the votes have been collected in Pennsylvania. Trump is trailing Clinton by 3 percent.\nThe VoteCastr model is showing Clinton in place to win these eight battleground states. However, there is an expected surge of votes for Trump, later today. Nevertheless, if Clinton maintains her three-point lead in Florida, her victory will be solidified.\nIn order for Trump to take the 2016 presidential election, he would have to gain electoral votes from all the states in this report. In the last hour, Trump has not only tightened the gap in Ohio and Iowa, he has a one-point lead. Clinton leads in the remainder of these battleground states, however, her lead has narrowed from 4 to 3 percent.\nGuardian Liberty Voice will continue to provide updates throughout the election.\nWritten by Jeanette Smith\nSources:\nSlate: A New Approach to Covering Election Day\nVice News: Live Election Day Turnout Results\nImage Courtesy of Vince Alongi's Flickr Page 每 Creative Commons License Donald Trump , election , Hillary Clinton , spot , votes",

    "title": "Voter Suppression Illegal or Pure Intimidation",
    "text": "On Thursday Oct. 27, 2016, a Bloomberg Businessweek report was published with the aid of an anonymous, accredited source from Donald Trump's campaign. This informant announced a three-part voter suppression plan to intimidate Americans to win the election. The GOP presidential nominee felt Hillary Clinton could not win with out the votes of African-Americans, radical white liberals, or women. According to a recent poll, on Wednesday Nov. 2, Clinton was leading Trump by either a little or a lot in most states.\nThe report in BusinessWeek was initiated by several weeks of a Trump tirade inquiring about the honesty of the U.S. election process. Ranting that the system was rigged against him.\nAn official source inside the Trump campaign, announced there were three large-scale voter suppression plans. Each was aimed at one of three select groups. They believed Clinton could not win without support from these groups.\nVoter intimidation is used to describe an action or actions taken by a person or group, directed at eligible voters to keep them from voting. This is usually done by putting up signs with false dates or passing out phony fliers to mislead citizens.\nHowever, the BusinessWeek article described a plan that was designed to discourage people from casting their ballot for Clinton. The Trump campaign planned on reminding black voters of a comment made by the Democratic presidential nominee, in 1994, while Bill Clinton was promoting a crime bill for the metropolitan areas. It was then, she referred to certain African-Americans as ※Superpreditors.§\nTrump repetedly asked his supporters to go out with everyone they know, and watch the voting booths for signs of it being rigged against him. This begs two questions; Was this to intimidate Clinton Voters? and Was it legal to watch people so closely attempting to do their patriotic duty?\nWhen Trump told everyone at a rally, in Pennsylvania, he could not lose because of ※you know what I mean,§ he stepped onto an awkward line that leaned dangerously toward illegal. According to an expert on election law, Rick Hansen, having a group of people organized at polling stations, watching people, and causing them to feel distressed could cross that line into illegal voter intimidation.\nA good example of this would be Roger Stone, who is Trump's former advisor, who planned to have over a thousand volunteers, in several major cities in swing states that usually vote Democrat, set up monitoring stations at polling booths. How the volunteers watched people would determine if their voter intimidation tactics were illegal.\nThere are four federal laws, along with each state's individual laws, on voter intimidation. The federal rules are as follows; no one is allowed to make any abusive remarks at the balloters, or have any direct confrontation with them, there cannot be any raising of voices or casting insults at people entering the station to do their civic duty. These laws are the line a Republican clerk once crossed and was suspended from duty for this violation. Intimidating people to influence the outcome of an event or situation can easily backfire and end with severe consequences.\nBy Katherine Miller\nEdited by Jeanette Smith\nSources:\nThe NY Times : Donald Trump campaign seeks ＆voter suppression' sources says, but it's legal\nCNN : Donald Trump spokesman denies voter suppression claim\nTime.com : Why Donald Trump Ballot Watchers ＆Might Be' Illegal\nTop and Feature Image Courtesy of Stephan Melkisethian's Flickr Page 每 Creative Commons License vote",

Do you think your vote for president in the United States counts? Think again＃ Ultimately, the Electoral College votes determine who becomes president, not the majority or popular vote. So, what is the Electoral College? The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. (1) The popular vote, on the other hand, is to appease the masses in thinking that they actually have a say in who gets elected. The above image is from NBC affiliate WRCB TV in Chattanooga, TN who apparently already have the results from the election that hasn't occurred yet. (2) So, how is this possible? In 2012, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) legalized the use of PROPAGANDA on the American public. (3) This includes ANYTHING the mainstream media ※reports§ including the election results before they happened. This is reminiscent of the BBC announcing that World Trade Center building 7 collapsed before it actually collapsed on 9/11. (4) Related: British Man Won Law Suit Against BBC for 9/11 Cover Up As reported by Top Right News and other outlets, during a recent interview with Bloomberg News, Soros 每 a Democrat mega-donor 每 openly admitted that Trump will win the popular vote in a ※landslide.§ However, he said that none of that would matter, because a president Hillary Clinton is already a ※done deal .§ In the interview, which is now going viral, Soros says with certainty that Trump will take the popular vote , despite what the polls say now (which are completely rigged to oversample Democrats), but not the Electoral College, which will go to Clinton . When the reporter asks if that is already a ※done deal§每 that Clinton will be our next president no matter what 每 Soros says ※yes,§ and nods his head. (5) George Soros is most likely one of the main cogs in the shadow government . Look no further than all of the money his ※Open Society Institute§ donated to ※ Black Lives Matter § (6). His main agenda is to keep America living in the premise of ※Divide and Conquer§. As long as America is divided, we cannot come together under a united cause. A George Soros company, Smartmatic, has provided voting machine technology in 16 states including battleground zones like Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia. You can read more about George Soros and his dark allegiance here . Other jurisdictions affected are California, District of Columbia, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. Its website includes a flow-chart that describes how the company has contributed to elections in the U.S. from 2006-2015 with ※57,000 voting and counting machines deployed§ and ※35 million voters assisted.§ After this report's publication, Smartmatic updated its website to remove the flow chart and declare that ※Smartmatic will not be deploying its technology in any U.S. county for the upcoming 2016 U.S. Presidential elections.§ (7) I'm not buying it. Are you? My ※vote§ is for a council of elders to replace ALL governments and politicians . The current system is corrupt, broken, and outdated. It's time to evolve! (8) Source & References:",

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/un-votes-to-ban-nuclear-weapons-in-2017.html On October 27, 2016, the United Nations Committee For Nuclear Disarmament voted in favor of a resolution to begin negotiations on a treaty in 2017 which will aim to outlaw destructive(fission) nuclear weapons. 123 voted in favor of the resolution, which was created by Austria, Brazil, South Africa, Ireland, Mexico and Nigeria, while 38 voted against and 16 abstained from voting either way.Not surprisingly, four of the five big UN Security Council nuclear powers voted against the resolution, which included France, U.S. Britain and Russia. The fifth country, China, abstained from the vote. 123 countries voted in favor of the resolution. Ref. Interestingly, Japan voted against the resolution, even though nuclear fission bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki many years ago.In a very surprising move, North Korea voted in favor of the disarmament resolution and said they will bring in a, ※legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination.§ Kate Hudson, who is the Chair for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament said : ※It's very encouraging to see so many countries say loud and clear it's time for the world to move on from nuclear weapons. We have united before to ban biological and chemical weapons, landmines and cluster bombs, and now the international community is taking decisive steps to ban nuclear weapons.§ The world wants peace. Ref. In addition to the U.N. vote, the European Parliament adopted it's own resolution which was supported by 415 votes, opposed by 124 and 74 chose not to vote. This is another positive step forward as the European nations can help to add great weight to a resolution to finally disarm the world of destructive nuclear weapons.The resolution will be put forth to the UN General Assembly in December and is now likely to pass, which will then pave the way for further negotiations to take place in March, June and July of 2017.Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, described the vote as a ※historic moment§ in the decades-long drive for a nuclear-free world. ※This treaty won't eliminate nuclear weapons overnight. But it will establish a powerful, new international legal standard, stigmatizing nuclear weapons and compelling nations to take urgent action on disarmament.§ Fission vs. Fusion It must be remembered though that there are differences when someone says or writes ※nuclear energy.§ Nuclear fission is the destructive kind. It's the kind that was used for the atomic bombs in Japan. Nuclean fusion is harmless, clean and can produce what is known as ※free energy.§According to Duke Energy :Both fission and fusion are nuclear reactions that produce energy, but the applications are not the same.Fission is the splitting of a heavy, unstable nucleus into two lighter nuclei, and fusion is the process where two light nuclei combine together releasing vast amounts of energy.For example, the Sun is a massive producer of nuclear fusion energy, which is what scientists are working on to try and create ※free energy.§The world must push for the disarmament of nuclear fission technology and must simultaneously push for the advancement of nuclear fusion technology. The world is moving in a peaceful direction and this is further evidence of such claims. What do you think will happen in 2017 with these negotiations? By Lance Schuttler",

    "text": "Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \nAdd another group to the list of people who won't be voting for Donald Trump. Oh, a few of them might but after they see this ad for Trump, I'm betting the majority will laugh and vote for Hillary Clinton. \nEarlier in the month, Trump attended a Bollywood concert for charity. It was organized by the Republican Hindu Coalition, a group that was founded by a rich Indian-American named Shalli Kumar, who is looking to be the Hindu Sheldon Adelson. The Indian community is heavily Democratic so good luck with that. \nTrump came to the event, lit the Diya 〞 it's doubtful that he had any idea what it was 〞 and then spoke. He pandered told the attendees that ※the Indian and Hindu community will have a true friend in the White House,§ promising they will ※defeat radical Islamic terrorism.§ \nThis inspired Kumar to make an ad which will be playing 20 times a day on Indian-American channels. He refused to say how much it cost the campaign to buy that much time but we can guess that Mr. Kumar is helping foot the bill. He previously has given almost $1 million to a fundraising committee which benefited both Trump and the RNC. \nThere is a lot to laugh about in the ad, bt Trump's inability to pronounce Hindi words takes teh cake. It is such an obvious bit of pandering, even for him. \nThe ad starts with a wish for a Happy Diwali , a holiday I am certain Trump is ignorant of. The cut to Trump's orange face is a bit jarring after the pretty lights and flowers. \nKumar wanted to draw a similarity between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The PM's campaign had used a clever catchphrase which loosely translates to ※This time a Modi government.§ Kumar wanted Trump to replace Modi's name with his own. In Hindi, that is ※Ab ki baar Trump sarkar.§ Don't get ahead of me, now. \nIn the ad, which uses footage of Trumps speech at the charity concert, a 2008 photo of the hotel which was attacked by Islamic militants in Mumbai gives way to a picture of PM Modi. Then back to Trump who tries to speak the short Hindi phrase. It's something one must see to believe. \nMake sure you aren't drinking anything as you may endanger your computer. \n※Approved by Donald Trump?§ Well, I guess so. This ad is not just pandering, it is awful. I hope the Indian American community laugh this off and then go vote against this man who only shows interest in their culture when it might get him votes. \nOh, and Happy Diwali! May the light burn away any bad times and welcome the good. \nFeatured Image by Kena Betancur/Getty Images Share this Article!",

    "title": "Republicans Threatening To Create Havoc At Polls To Root Out ＆Voter Fraud'",
    "text": "Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \nDonald Trump has been claiming for weeks that the election is going to be ※rigged§ to prevent him from winning. He has made repeated calls to his supporters to go to the polls and keep an eye on what is going on. Even though a number of GOP candidates and officeholders have rejected Trump's claim that there will be massive voter fraud, in some places the Republican Party is holding training classes for poll watchers. \nIn-person voter fraud, which is what the GOP has claimed for several years is costing their candidates elections, has been repeatedly proven to be so rare as to almost not exist. But that doesn't stop people like Trump from raising the alarm about it. And what he has been saying is having an effect. \nAccording to The Washington Times, Arizona Republican officials say that in 2012 their poll watcher training sessions attracted maybe 50 or 60 people. This year, thanks to Trump's Chicken Little-type warning, that number has increased to over 1,000. \nIn Virginia, which has moved from red to purple to relatively blue in recent years, poll watcher trainees at a class in Fairfax County, just outside Washington D.C., expressed their belief that Trump is correct , according to The Wall Street Journal. \nPenny Hendrix, a 52-year-old stay at home mom, said this: \n※Very clearly there is going to be massive voter fraud, and it will definitely be to ensure Hillary Clinton wins. I've been concerned about this for some time, and Trump bringing it up is raising awareness.§ \nExcept that he is raising awareness of a problem that isn't really a problem at all. Even the extremely right-wing Heritage Foundation, which produced a list of voter fraud convictions , could only put together about 300 examples. Now, 300 cases of voter fraud in one national election where millions of ballots are cast is a very small amount. But the Heritage list covers multiple years and multiple elections, making the impact even smaller than miniscule. The GOP has truly become an organization of Don Quixotes who are preparing to tilt at imaginary illegal voters. \nThe leader of the Virginia poll watcher training, Republican activist Reagan George, told the attendees that they can't challenge someone just because it looks like that person is going to be voting for Democrats. But he followed that statement by regaling his audience with stories of Democrats taking pictures of their votes so they can be rewarded by union officials or other GOP bogeymen. He also told them of how Democrats in some areas of the country have been getting the severely disabled to vote, even those who don't really understand what is going on. And has George seen things like that happen with his own eyes? Of course not! But he has heard stories. And to a conservative, any story you hear from another conservative about some alleged misdeed carries much weight than actual facts and evidence. \nThere's not going to be massive voter fraud in this election, just as there has never been massive voter fraud before. Even in what was perhaps the most contentious election in recent U.S. history, the one in 2000, the issues with voting affected the outcome, in only one state 〞 Florida. And as we all well know, those problems were caused not by voter fraud, but by poor election mechanics. What Trump and his GOP allies are attempting is to create bedlam on election day, and maybe in the process manage to win by intimidating hundreds or even thousands of legal voters in key states. \nFeatured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images Share this Article!",

    "text": "By Michael Hayne Election 2016 , News , Politics October 28, 2016 Paul Ryan's Plan To Use Bernie To Scare Voters Blew Up In His Face And Bernie Can't Stop Laughing   \nThe 2016 election continues to be the weirdest, dumbest, and most contentious presidential race in ages. But the one saving grace and glimmer of hope amid this Category 4 sh*tstorm is the idea of an empowered Senator Sanders. \nA week ago, House Speaker Paul Ryan made the fatal mistake of using Bernie Sanders as a scare tactic to ensure that Congress remains in Republican hands. At a gathering of Young Republicans, Ryan implored Republicans to take the polls on Election Day in order to stop the scary ※ liberal progressive§ agenda. Ryan punctuated his warning by saying ※ If we lose the Senate, do you know who becomes chair of the Senate Budget Committee? A guy named Bernie Sanders. You ever heard of him?§ \nWell, that single statement appears to have totally blown up in his face. \nIt's not yet clear if the populist and beloved Senator from Vermont would chair the Senate Budget Committee should Democrats take back the Senate, but what is clear is that Bernie Sanders is cashing in on Ryan's comments. Paul Ryan said if Republicans lose the Senate, a guy named Bernie Sanders becomes Budget Committee Chair. Sounds like a plan! #ThanksPaul \n〞 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 24, 2016 \nHoping to convince the intractable ※Bernie or Bust§ crowd that a Democratically-controlled Senate is the best way to carry out his very progressive agenda, Sanders implored his 3.76 million followers to donate to Democrats. The Sanders team went so far as launching a ※We Heard You Paul!§ appeal to small donors. And it's working每insanely well. \n※Let's thank Speaker Ryan for helping us raise $2.4 million this week from 500,000 contributions and show everyone how powerful the political revolution still is by using the hashtag #ThanksPaul across all social media channels today,§ the Sanders camp announced Monday. \nSanders is in this thing for the long run and has no intention of slowing down anytime soon. The only way to ensure Ryan's threat becomes a reality is turning the Congress blue. \nFeatured image via Alex Wong and Mark Wilson / Getty Share this Article!",

However, there's a substantial portion of the electorate that seems not to see just how absolutely dangerous the guy is as just a presidential candidate, much less how dangerous he would be as president. However, it seems that some of Trump's supporters DO recognize that he's a total nutcase, but plan to vote for him anyway. One woman's reason is truly out of this world.

    "text": "Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \nVoter fraud has been on the minds of Republicans for a while now. It has been proven that while yes, there are isolated incidences of in-person voter fraud, there has never been a case where it was so rampant that it changed the results of an election. But that's exactly what the GOP wants you to think is going on. \nDonald Trump took Republican rhetoric about voter fraud and has ramped it up to an entirely new level, claiming that the upcoming election is going to be ※rigged.§ Apparently, Republicans are in on this alleged rigging along with Democrats, since a number of the states where the vote looks to be close are controlled by the GOP. And as everyone outside of Trump's basket of deplorables knows, election mechanics are handled by the states, not the federal government. \nHow are Trump's supporters reacting to all of his claims about voter fraud? Well, in at least one case the answer to that question is ※By committing voter fraud themselves.§ \nTerri Lynn Rote, 55, an Iowa Trump supporter, has been charged with ※election misconduct,§ which is a Class D felony in the state. According to Iowa Public Radio, Rote allegedly voted for Trump twice when she cast her ballot during early voting. And her reason? She was afraid that her first vote would be changed to a vote for Hillary Clinton, so she voted again. The Des Moines Register reports that Rote voted once at the Polk County elections office , then again at a county satellite polling location. \nRote told Iowa Public Radio, \n※I wasn't planning on doing it twice, it was spur of the moment. The polls are rigged.§ \nAccording to the Register, Rote's case was one of three voter fraud cases that occurred in Polk County alone. The other two incidents involved people who voted on mail-in ballots, then voted again in person. Polk County auditor Jamie Fitzgerald says this is the first time in his 12 years in office he has had to deal with even one case of voter fraud, let alone three. There are no details about who the other two suspects cast ballots for. The sad thing is, polls have been saying for weeks that Trump is going to win Iowa. Cases like this might put his win there in question, which would be a perfect example of poetic justice. \nThis is what the rhetoric about voter fraud has come t0 〞 people attempting to vote multiple times because they're convinced that their chosen candidate is going to be cheated out of a legitimate win. Republicans, unwilling to accept that their policies are being rejected by a larger and larger segment of the U.S. population, are trying to sell the message that elections are being stolen from the GOP by ※massive§ voter fraud. Yet, time after time, it seems to be Republicans who are committing the lion's share of it. They claim to love the country, but Trump and the GOP are deliberately undermining the foundation of a democracy 〞 the integrity of the vote. Next, Trump will claim that people like Terri Rote are ※political prisoners.§ Just wait for it. \nFeatured image via Twitter",

They've lost the popular vote five of the last six elections, and if things go the way they're going and American liberals get out to vote, it's going to be six of the last seven on the morning of November 9. \nTrump and the Republican Party would like their followers to believe that this isn't because their ideology is painfully out of step with the country in modern times. Instead, Trump claims the election will be stolen from him 每 whether by ※Mexicans,§ or the media, or a ※cabal of international bankers.§ \nBut see, here's the thing: there is a self-proclaimed billionaire who's working to undermine the election, and it's not Carlos Slim 〞 it's Donald J. Trump and his paranoid loony bin followers, which include a disturbing number of white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazis, and John Birch dropouts. \nWhile speaking to a crowd at a rally in Greeley, Colorado late Sunday, Trump once again cast doubts on the mail-in ballots , encouraging people to get another ballot and mail that one in , too. Over and over: \n※Who has sent their ballots in? And do you think those ballots are properly counted?§ Trump asked the audience, to which they replied ※No!§ \nTrump continued by expressing his skepticism and telling supporters to go get new ballots to ensure their vote is counted. \n※ If you go to university center, they'll give you a new ballot, they'll void your old ballot, in some places they do that four or five times, so by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in. § \nCNN said the comment was ※stoking skepticism§ because they don't have the wherewithal to call this what it really is: encouraging voter fraud. \n※Liberal media§ my ass. \nAnd it appears to be having an effect. Some of Trump's followers have already taken this message to heart, and at least one has already been arrested for it . \nBetween these clowns and the clowns that are going to ※make sure there isn't any illegal voting at the booths§〞 i.e, instigate voter intimidation against Hispanics, Arabs, African-Americans and anyone else who doesn't look like a white Trump supporter 〞 one gets the feeling that election night is going to be a chaotic one. \nPhoto by Win McNamee/Getty Images Share this Article!",

    "title": "Donald Trump Continues To Lie About Voter Fraud, Claims Officials Will Throw Away Mail-In Ballots",
    "text": "Elections only work if the population consents to the legitimacy of the other side's victory, and that's why Donald Trump's sour grapes rhetoric about voter fraud is so dangerous. Trump, of course, isn't alone in his degenerate thinking, but honestly, he's got the biggest stage to preach it from. \nAnd he's only ramped that rhetoric up as the polls have shown his campaign going downhill. It's not enough to make me comfortable 〞 I hope that American liberals get out and vote against him 〞 but it's enough to make Trump feel the burn. His claims of voter fraud are little more than whining, but that doesn't stop people from believing claims like the one he made at a Colorado rally on Saturday, where he said election officials would throw away mail-in ballots if they don't ※like§ them. ※Real Problem§ \nHowever, it's worth analyzing his previous claims all the same. Trump claimed that an International Cabal of Bankers is conspiring with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim to ※rig§ the American election and bring a permanent end to the United States . If this sounds completely insane to you, that's because it is. \nHowever, it's worth noting the things that the average American is going to miss in that statement. \nFor instance, ※international cabal of bankers§ is pretty transparent talk for ※Jews.§ One of the major conspiracy theories of these Antisemitic loons is the International Jewish banker conspiracy 〞 it's so important that it has its own fiction novel devoted to it (it was one of Henry Ford's favorite books): Protocols of the Elders of Zion . In fact, when I typed ※cabal of international bankers§ in Google, it helpfully suggested ※elders of zion§ as a related search. Given his voter base consists of white nationalists, the KKK, neo-Nazis, and racists in general, it shouldn't surprise you to learn he might as well be quoting from the seminal work of Antisemitism. \nAnd if you think I'm reading too much into this, let me remind you that his foreign policy advisor allegedly said that the Nazi ovens were ※too small§ to kill six million Jewish people . His alt-right supporters have savaged Jewish reporter simply for being Jewish . Antisemitism swirls around the man. \nTrump's latest made up accusations aren't couched in the same extremely transparent and Antisemitic rhetoric that his usual accusations are. Instead, they're the sort of straightforward nonsense that we've come to expect from Agent Orange when he attempts to speak a mind he doesn't have. \nWhile speaking before a Colorado rally on Saturday, Trump told the audience that election officials are going to ※throw out§ mail-in ballots they disagree with, saying: \n※I have real problems with ballots being sent. People say, oh, here's a ballot, bing. Here's another ballot, throw it away. Oh, here's one I like, we'll keep that one.§ Trump talks voter fraud in Colorado; says he has a \"real problem\" with mail in ballots. (h/t @ergold ) pic.twitter.com/FS0LUOhIVc \n〞 Ali Vitali (@alivitali) October 29, 2016 \nTrump seems to think that there are going to be a ※lot of people watching§ to make sure that the ballots are correct, which is utterly delusional at best and disastrous at worst. These walking poster children for Dunning-Kruger have no idea what they're doing; they're armed, emotionally charged, racist, clueless, and out to protect ※their country§〞 which doesn't include people like me. \nPerhaps they should all wear brown shirts, too. That way, police know who to remove once they've cast their vote. \n※We're trying to have some pretty good supervision out there,§ he warned. \nSure you are. If by ※supervision§ you mean people carrying out voter intimidation. Because that's exactly what'll happen. \nPhoto by Spencer Platt/Getty Images Share this Article!",

    "text": "November 2, 2016 Alabama Republican Official: ＆Just Because You Turned 18 Doesn't Give You The Right To Vote' (VIDEO)   \nAlabama Secretary of State John Merrill has a big problem with increasing the number of registered voters in his state. \nSlate reports that Merrill, like many Republicans, opposes recent reforms in voter registration policies that could significantly increase the number of registered voters. \nThe proposal would automatically register eligible state residents ※who interact with government agencies§ to vote. According to the Brennan Center , this legislation would also guarantee that voter-registration information is moved on to election officials electronically, which will reduce errors in the voting process. \nHowever, Merrill says that he stands opposed to this initiative because it ※cheapen[s] the work§ of civil rights activists, adding that ※just because you turned 18 doesn't give you the right [to vote].§ \n※These people fought, some of them were beaten, some of them were killed because of their desire to ensure that everybody that wanted to had the right to register to vote and participate in the process,§ Merrill explained in an interview with the voting rights initiative, Answering the Call . \nHe then went on to reference several civil rights leaders, like Georgia U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who Merrill claimed called him a friend. \nMerrill continued, ※I'm not going to embarrass them by allowing someone that's too sorry to get up off of their rear end to go register to vote ＃ because they think they deserve the right because they turned 18.§ \nThe jackass then went on to say that automatically registering teen voters to be able to exercise their right to vote is ※no different than giving them a trophy because they played on the ball team. You only get a trophy if you win!§ \n※I think it's a sorry, lazy way out and it shows no initiative.§ \nAlabama joins 14 other states who have enacted new voting restrictions ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The Brennan Center says that these actions are designed to ※curtail voting rights.§ \nThe New York Times reported last year that the restrictions Alabama put in place included a photo ID law, which makes having a government issued ID mandatory to participate in the voting process. \nThe biggest problem with these identification laws is that many older and poorer citizens are faced with hardships when it comes to obtaining the necessary paperwork needed to get a government I.D. Many states also structure the office hours of their DMV services and polling locations to discourage people further from voting. \nThe bottom line is that Republicans love low voter turn out because they can't convince the vast majority of Americans that their ideas are good for the country. \nFeatured image via YouTube .",

End of story.§ \n※Look, it is important to understand that presidential elections are breathtakingly close. They are decided by just 5, 10, 15 votes per precinct,§ she added. \nMichelle Obama's passionate plea comes after a long and contentious campaign. Some people are convinced their vote doesn't matter. Some people are still pouting because their favorite candidate didn't win the primary. Others have swallowed the kool-aid and believe both candidates are the same. But Michelle Obama is right, not voting or voting for a third party candidate is the same as casting a vote for Trump. Quite frankly, there is just too much at stake for that this time around. \nWatch Michelle Obama give warn Americans about the importance of their vote, here: \nFeatured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Share this Article!",

Still, it's shocking that this is what our elections have come to. \nA Trump supporter picked a fight with a voter at a Palm Beach polling place over his choice of candidate. The crazed right-winger ended up pulling a gun on the African American man who was simply trying to cast his vote. \nAccording to the victim , Tobian Norris, he was on his way to vote when he ran into a Trump supporter intent on causing trouble. \n※I saw this guy, he was basically soliciting votes for Donald Trump and he decided he wanted to solicit me,§ Norris said. \nHe says he made it clear that there was no way he would ever consider voting for Trump. After a brief discussion about Trump and his opponent, Hillary Clinton, Norris finally asked the Trump supporter if he had graduated high school and all hell broke loose. The man lunged at Norris, attacking him and knocking the phone he had been using to film the incident to the ground. \n※He grabbed my hand and knocked the phone out of my hand and called me the n-word, and I just blacked out and hit him in the ribs, and he pulled a gun on me,§ Norris recalled. \nWhen Norris defended himself, punching the assailant in the ribs, the crazed man did what any good Trump supporter would do: He pulled out a gun. \nThe victim ran and was thankfully unharmed. This could have ended so much worse. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's deputies arrived and arrested the gun toting Trump follower. \nNorris recorded the entire exchange and posted it live on Facebook.

    "title": "Maine's Gov. LePage Threatens To ＆Investigate' College Students For Fraud If They Vote (VIDEO)",
    "text": "Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \nOn Monday, Paul LePage, Maine's infamous racist Governor, issued a statement which basically threatened any out-of-state student attending college in his state with an investigation should they decide to vote. \nLePage's statement came on the eve of Election Day, and many believe it was designed to scare Democratic leaning college students away from the polls. \nThe governor complained about Democrats encouraging out-of-state students to commit voter fraud by voting in both their home state and the state where they are attending college. He also said that ※there is no way to determine§ if a person has cast his or her ballot in two states. \nThe Washington Post : \n※Democrats for decades have encouraged college students from out of state to vote in Maine, even though there is no way to determine whether these college students also voted in their home states,§ LePage said in a statement. \n※Casting ballots in two different states is voter fraud, which is why Maine law requires anyone voting here to establish residency here. We welcome college students establishing residency in our great state, as long as they follow all laws that regulate voting, motor vehicles and taxes. We cannot tolerate voter fraud in our state.§ \nLePage continued, ※After the election, we will do everything we can that is allowed under state and federal law to verify college students who voted here are following Maine law, which is clearly displayed on the Secretary of State's website.§ \nHowever, Maine's Secretary of State, Matthew Dunlap, says that they do have a system in place to detected that kind of voter fraud, and they've yet to find evidence of this being a real issue. Dunlap told WMTW ABC 8: \n※People are not voting in two different jurisdictions. In fact, the Secretary of State's office back in 2011 did just such an investigation of over 200 students who were from out of state, and who had registered and voted in Maine to see if they had voted in their home state, and nobody did.§ \nAlong with the Governor's statement, college students at Bates College received a mysterious orange flyer informing them that if they are out of state, students that they must change their driver's license and re-register their vehicle (which the flyer claimed cost ※usually hundreds of dollars in total§). \nThe flyer included an official government website address, as well as references to several state statutes regarding the registration of personal motorized vehicles in Maine. College students in Maine: This flyer is FALSE. You may use your dorm as your legal address to vote. pic.twitter.com/jOE6MvH02s \n〞 Maine College Dems (@MECollegeDem) November 7, 2016 \nTo the average college student, this flyer would probably seem legit. However, as the above tweet states, college students are allowed to use their dorm address as their permanent residence while attending school in the state. \nMaine's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has requested that the Justice Department step in to investigate. \n※The governor's statement seems designed to make college students afraid to vote,§ Zachary Heiden, legal director at the ACLU of Maine, said in a statement. ※Voter intimidation and harassment is illegal, and we call on the Department of Justice to investigate the intent of the governor's comments. \n※College students who live in Maine have the right to vote in Maine, and they are not subject to different laws than anyone else. Many of these young people are voting for the first time in a presidential election. The governor should be encouraging that civic participation, not doing everything in his power to undermine it.§ \nMaine's Democratic party is calling this a classic case of GOP voter suppression efforts aimed at minority groups whom they feel will vote Democratic. \n※The false information contained in these fliers is a deliberate attempt to suppress the millennial vote,§ Maine Democratic Party Chairman Phil Bartlett said in a statement. ※There is nothing in Maine law that states that college students must change their driver's licenses in order to vote. \n※In fact, the Secretary of State's office has made explicitly clear that a dorm can be a student's legal voting residence, and that paying out-of-state tuition does not preclude a student from voting. Maine also has same-day voter registration, so students who are not registered to vote in Maine can still register on Election Day. We urge all Bates students to spread the word to their fellow classmates about their voting rights here in Maine.§ \nDespite their best efforts, numerous states are reporting record turnout numbers, which traditionally doesn't bode well for Republicans who prefer low voter turnout for any group that's isn't non-educated, white, and male. \nFeatured image via YouTube",

Since that time, Christie has bounced from humiliation to humiliation at the hands of Trump. Stories of Trump's schoolyard bullying of Christie range from the time he made the Governor of New Jersey get him french fries, to the time he publicly mocked his weight, to the time he told Christie to get off the stage and wait on the plane, to the time he suggested Christie could be vice president only to change him mind at the last minute and pick Mike Pence instead. \nThe last 16 months have been hard on Christie. The indignities were written all over his face as he walked, alone and in the dark , towards the voting booth in New Jersey. A man, broken and demoralized, casting a vote for the guy who routinely humiliated him. If a picture says a thousand words, then what does this say? Here's a picture of Christie going to vote this morning at 6:06 am, right when polls opened. He didn't tell press. https://t.co/3QIgk1sgBW pic.twitter.com/tJEMSwN1y0 \n〞 Annie-Rose Strasser (@ARStrasser) November 8, 2016 \nPerhaps nobody in America had a worse year than Gov. Chris Christie 每 and nobody has deserved his comeuppance more. All but conceding that his time in politics was over, the deeply unpopular governor ignored the job he was elected to do in New Jersey to fly around the country with Donald Trump. Those fast food orders weren't going to pick up themselves. \nIn the meantime, the ※Bridgegate§ scandal that had torched his administration was drawing to a close, with several of his former advisers implicating Christie himself in the plan to shut down traffic to punish a political rival. Just last week, things reached their inevitable conclusion with many of his closest staffers being convicted of the crimes. Christie, who has no possible route to office ever again, seems to understand that 2016 marked a Rubicon of sorts. He crossed the river and there is no going back. His reputation, his lifetime's work in government, his chances for a future presidency, have all gone up in smoke. \nAnd so he drudged in the bitterly cold New Jersey pre-dawn towards the ballot box. Broken, beaten, and hollow. Chris Christie casts his vote for Donald Trump; his abuser, yes, but also the only man who will take his calls. \nFeatured image via Twitter",

    "text": "Share on Twitter IJR Opinion is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. \nYou ask, ※Why Trump?§ From your college classrooms, comfortable suburban homes and your summer lakeside retreats in quaint New England towns, you wonder why. \nWhile in class the professor comments, ※Well, the main supporters of Trump are uneducated white males.§ You, a new age liberal sympathizer - and my classmate - blurt out, ※Uneducated white males shouldn't have the right to vote!§ \nIs this the college experience I signed up for? I know I'm the type of person liberals like you disdain; I've spent about half my years on this earth working blue collar jobs: logging, haying, septic work, farming, stacking stone walls. I've owned two 1940s era tractors. You don't know what true labor is. I do - I was born and bred into this lifestyle. \nAll over this land, alarms go off before the dawn. You may work from 9 to 5 in a cozy office, but for the working class the day stretches from dawn to dusk. Sometimes it takes two or more jobs to make ends meet. ※Work hard and you will be rewarded,§ says the world. But those with the most wealth have only found ways to make others work hard for them. \nAlthough I have chosen to not cast my ballot for the Republican ticket this time around, I have empathy for those who will - those whom you, modern liberalism, created. You outsource businesses and you coddle illegal immigrants who drive down the cost of labor - and therefore the benefits of a job. You, the rich, liberal elite, have taken advantage of those whose backs you live upon. You gutted them, you skinned them, you left them to hang like a deer carcass to bleed out. \nOn top of it all, you say people like me are ※white trash,※§standard rednecks※ and ※dirty hicks.§ The champions of social justice that attend my liberal arts college in rural Vermont call us ※dirty townies.\" \nWe grow your food, we transport your food, we build your homes and we keep them maintained - and yet we are snubbed. We plow the roads, fix the power lines and drive semi-trucks so that you can live a life of convenience. You cut our wages and our hours - yet you say we don't work hard enough. \nSince I was 12, I have worked for both rich Republicans and rich Democrats. At least the rich Republicans don't preach all that Democrats do to save the world - while paying me dirt. Few of those who support Hillary Clinton have had to awaken at 3:45 A.M. to start a chainsaw in the dim light of dawn, to work a job where either that chainsaw, a wood chipper, or a falling tree could kill them any day - for the reward of $12 an hour, no less. What is the working man's death worth to those with millions? \nYou distract us with the media and you harp on racism, sexism and the insignificant. Where in your agenda is there time for the growing class struggle, the death of family farming, and the tearing of the fabric of rural New England life? You swoop in from elsewhere to buy the land, gentrify the towns, and reduce the local population to the same status as the English peasant after the enclosure movement . \nYou speak of social programs, give to those who do nothing, give every child a trophy and shelter them from the realities of the world. You talk of raising taxes that the rich somehow never pay. You would rather take a loaf of bread from the working stiff to support the unemployed or those who drink away a college education. \nThe question at hand should not be, ※Why Trump?§ The question at hand should be why you drove those who support him into a hole and then tied their hands behind their backs. You want them to support the broken system that gave you, not them, the benefit. Soon, you won't have to worry about them supporting Trump; rum-filled farmers, a rabble in arms... \nThose whom you called a ※ basket of deplorables § are the same stock that brought America into being. Yet, raise taxes, you say. Raise the cost of living, of each and every good that is bought and sold. The resulting burden will only fall upon those who labor their lives away, to struggle to exist, who always will.",

    "text": "Share on Twitter \nYou've all heard by now that Donald Trump thinks Hillary Clinton is trying to rig the campaign, including the idea that she's trying to suppress his voters. \nNow Bloomberg Businessweek has a major new story out on his campaign, including a few fascinating revelations: \n※Nate Silver's results have been similar to ours....except they lag by a week or two because he's relying on public polls.§ \nThe campaign holds rallies in non-traditional states like New Hampshire and Maine because data shows that's where the most persuadable voters can be found. \nYou meet Brad Parscale, Trump's main digital guy, who has quite a background. Join me on @thedonaldreddit Reddit AMA right now! https://t.co/tpyfSB0M75 〞 Brad Parscale (@parscale) October 25, 2016 \nMost importantly, the story also presents another side of the Trump campaign, an active effort to persuade Democrats not to vote. It concentrates on three key groups. 1) White Liberals \nTrump's invocation at the debate of Clinton's WikiLeaks e-mails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. 2) Young Women \nThe parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. 3) African-Americans \nHer 1996 suggestion that some African American males are ※super predators§ is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls〞particularly in Florida. \nThat strategy in action: \nOn Oct. 24, Trump's team began placing spots on select African American radio stations. In San Antonio, a young staffer showed off a South Park-style animation he'd created of Clinton delivering the ※super predator§ line (using audio from her original 1996 sound bite), as cartoon text popped up around her: ※Hillary Thinks African Americans are Super Predators.§ \nThe animation will be delivered to certain African American voters through Facebook ※dark posts§〞nonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that, as Parscale puts it, ※only the people we want to see it, see it.§ The aim is to depress Clinton's vote total. ※We know because we've modeled this,§ says the official. ※It will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out.§ \nEarly voting shows that the efforts to decrease turnout may not be working according to the Trump campaign's plan, but it's rare for a campaign to so openly boast of an effort to get people not to vote.",

    "title": "US Public Opinion Speaks to Anti-Militarism, the Electorate Votes for Warmongers    : Information",
    "text": "US Public Opinion Speaks to Anti-Militarism, the Electorate Votes for Warmongers By James Petras November 14, Castigating the US electorate as accomplices and facilitators of wars, or, at best, dismissing the voters as ignorant sheep-people (?sheeple?) herded by political elites, describes a partial reality. Public opinion polls, even the polls overwhelmingly slanted toward the center-right, consistently describe a citizenry opposed to militarism and wars, past and present.\nBoth the Right and Left have failed to grasp the contradiction that defines US political life: Namely, the profound gap between the American public and the Washington elite on questions of war and peace within an electoral process that consistently leads to more militarism.\nThis is an analysis of the most recent US public opinion polls with regard to outcome of the recent elections. The essay concludes with a discussion of the deep-seated contradictions and proposes several ways in which these contradictions can be resolved.\nMethod\nA major survey of public opinion, sponsored by the Charles Koch Institute and the Center for the National Interest, conducted by the Survey Sampling International, interviewed a sample of one thousand respondents.\nThe Results: War or Peace\nMore than half of the American public oppose any increase is the US military role overseas while only 25% back military expansion.\nThe public has expressed its disillusionment over Obama?s foreign policy, especially his new military commitments in the Middle East, which have been heavily promoted by the state of Israel and its US domestic Zionist lobby.\nThe US public shows a deep historical memory with regard to the past military debacles launched by Presidents Bush and Obama. Over half of the public (51%) believe that the US has become less safe over the past 15 years (2001-2015), while one eighth (13%) feel they are more secure.\nIn the present period, over half of the public opposes the deployment of ground troops to Syria and Yemen and only 10% favor continued US support for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nWith regard to specific US wars, over half believe that Bush?s invasion of Iraq made the US homeland less secure, while only 25% believe it didn?t increase or decrease domestic security. Similar responses were expressed with regard to Afghanistan: 42% believe the Afghan War increased insecurity and about a third (34%) felt it did not affect US security.\nIn terms of future perspectives, three quarters (75%) of the American public want the next President to focus less on the US military operations abroad or are uncertain about its role. Only 37% are in favor of increased spending for the military.\nThe mass media and the powerful financial backers of the Democratic Presidential candidate have focused on demonizing Russia and China as ?the greatest threats in our time?. In contrast, almost two thirds (63.4%) of Americans believe the greatest threat comes from terrorism both foreign and domestic. Only 18% view Russia and China as major threats to their security.\nIn regard to the Pentagon, 56% want to reduce or freeze current military spending while only 37% want to increase it.\nWars and Peace: The Political Elites\nContrary to the views of a majority of the public, the last four US Presidents, since the 1990?s, have increased the military budget, sending hundreds of thousands of US troops to launch wars in three Middle Eastern countries, while promoting bloody civil wars in three North African and two European countries. Despite public opinion majorities, who believe that the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq have increased threats to the US security, Obama kept ground troops, air and sea forces and drone operations in those countries. Despite only 10% public approval for his military policies, the Obama regime has sent arms, advisors and Special Forces to support the Saudi dictatorship?s invasion of tiny Yemen.\nObama and the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton pushed a policy of encircling Russia and demonizing its President Putin as the greatest threat to the US in contrast to US opinion, which considers the threat of Islamist terrorism as five times more serious.\nWhile the political elite and the leading Presidential candidates promise to expand the number of US troops abroad and increase military spending, over three quarters of the American public oppose or are uncertain about expanding US militarism.\nWhile candidate Clinton campaigned for the deployment of the US Air Force jets and missiles to police a ?no fly zone? in Syria, even shooting down Syrian and Russian government planes, the majority of US public opposed it by 51%.\nIn terms of constitutional law, fully four-fifths (80%) of the US public believes the President must secure Congressional approval for additional military action abroad. Nevertheless, Presidents from both parties, Bush and Obama launched wars without Congressional approval, creating a precedent which the next president is likely to exploit.\nAnalysis and Perspectives\nOn all major foreign policy issues related to waging war abroad, the political elite is far more bellicose than the US public; they are far more likely to ignite wars that ultimately threaten domestic security; they are more likely to violate the Constitutional provisions on the declaration of war; and they are committed to increasing military spending even at the risk of defunding vital domestic social programs.\nThe political elites are more likely to intervene in wars in the Middle East, without domestic support and even in spite of majoritarian popular opposition to war. No doubt the executives of the oligarchical military-industrial complex, the pro-Israel power configuration and the mass media moguls are far more influential than the pro-democracy public.\nThe future portends a continuation of militarism by the political elites, and increase in domestic security threats and even less public representation.\nSome Hypothesis on the Contradiction between Popular Opinion and Electoral Outcomes\nThere is clearly a substantial gap between the majority of Americans and the political elite regarding the role of the military in overseas wars, the undermining of constitutional prerogatives, the demonization of Russia, the deployment of US troops to Syria and deeper US entanglement in Middle East wars for the benefit of Israel.\nYet it is also a fact that the US electorate continue to vote for the two major political parties which have consistently supported wars, formed military alliances with warring Middle East states, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel and aggressively sanctioned Russia as the main threat to US security.\nSeveral hypotheses regarding this contradiction should be considered:\n1. Close to 50% of the eligible voters abstain from voting in Presidential and Congressional elections. This most likely includes many among the majority of Americans who oppose the expansion of the US military role overseas. In fact, the war party ?winner? typically claims victory with less than 25% of the electorate ? and threats this as a mandate to launch more wars.\n2. The fact that the mass media vehemently supports one or the other of the two war parties probably influences a minority of the electorate who decide to actually participate in the elections. However, critics have exaggerated the mass media?s influence and fail to explain why the majority of the American public disagree with the mass media and oppose the militarist propaganda.\n3. Many Americans, while opposed to militarism, vote for the ?lesser evil? between the two war parties. They may believe that there are greater and lesser ?degrees? of war mongering and choose the less strident.\n4. Americans, who consistently oppose militarism, may decide to vote for militarist politicians for reasons besides those of overseas wars. For example, majoritarian Americans may support a militarist politician who has secured funding for local infrastructure programs, or protected farm and dairy subsidies, or who promises jobs programs, lowers public debt or opposes corrupt incumbents.\n5. Americans, opposed to militarism, may be deceived by the pronouncements of a demagogic presidential candidate from one of the war parties, whose promise of peace will give way to escalating wars.\n6. Likewise, the emphasis on ?identity politics? can deceive anti-war voters into supporting a proven militarist because of issues related to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual preferences or loyalties to overseas states.\n7. The war parties work together to block mass media access for anti-militarist parties, especially preventing their participation in national electoral debates viewed by tens of millions of voters. War parties collude to set impossible restrictions against anti-militarist party participation in national level elections, banning citizens with non-violent police records or former convicts who have served their sentences from voting. They reject poor citizens who lack photo identification, limit access to transport to voting sites, limit the number of polling places in poor or minority neighborhoods and deny time-off for workers to vote. Unlike other countries, US elections are held on a work day and many workers are unable to vote.\nIn other words the electoral process is ?rigged? and imposes ?forced voting? and abstention: Collusion between the two war parties limits voter choice to abstention or casting a ballot for the ?lesser evil? among the militarists.\nOnly if elections were open and democratic, where anti-militarist parties were allowed equal rights to register, participate and debate in the mass media, and where campaign financing were made equal would the contradictions between the wishes of the anti-militarist majorities and votes cast for pro-war elites be resolved.\nJames Petras is a Bartle Professor (Emeritus) of Sociology at Binghamton University, New York. http://petras.lahaine.org",

    "text": "Levers of Power: Flushing the Vote Down the Memory Hole Electronic election fraud exposed! David Knight | Infowars.com - October 26, 2016 Comments \nEstablishment politicians and press are outraged that Trump would question the integrity of their system. \nThey say it undermines public trust in political institutions. \nYet to see who is truly undermining public trust we need look no further than the people running the elections, who are shutting down election audit procedures, who stonewall and eject certified election monitors and who make any recording of malfunctioning voting machines a felony. \nOne such person is Texas Director of Elections, Keith Ingram. \nThis story is specific to Texas, but the same tactics are used nationwide by both parties to exploit vulnerabilities inherent in electronic voting. \nI went to the Texas Secretary of State offices to ask Mr. Ingram about specific procedural changes he has made in his 4 year tenure and the changes he attempted to make in August that would have gone into effect this November. \nWith camera & mic in hand, we told the reception desk that we were with the press and would like to talk to the Director about the election. \nWe were told to wait in the lobby and Mr. Ingram would be down. \nYou can see for yourself what happened when he saw the mic flag showing we were with Infowars. \nThe man running the election bureaucracy runs from questions. \nSo much for transparency and candor. \nThis unelected bureaucrat is tasked with ensuring that counties adhere to election law. \nWhat follows are the specific actions taken by his office that waive requirements and undermine election integrity in Texas. \nBut before we get to specifics about his actions & his connection to the Rose Law firm in Arkansas, there are some general questions that should concern voters nationwide: \n? Why would standards required by our elected lawmakers for election integrity be bent to the capabilities of vendors rather than require vendors to perform to the standard? \n? Why would election procedures be waived and honesty and transparency sacrificed for the convenience of election workers & officials? \nBurning The Paper Trail \nIn August 2016, Ingram, Texas Director of Elections, attempted to make last minute rule changes for the upcoming November 8 election that would eliminate crucial paper backup records for electronic voting. His office issued new rules that would: \nEliminate printing of paper audit logs that poll watchers are entitled to monitor at main tabulation computers. \nEliminate printing of Early Voting Results tapes. \nEliminate printing of ballot images for recounts. \nFortunately activists and some elected representatives got the proposed rule changes postponed, with a formal public hearing scheduled after the November election. \nState Senator Don Huffines said ※The state's chief election officers must reconsider and redraft their proposed election rules to pursue more real-time paper records and backups, not fewer＃The comfort & convenience of election administrators should not take priority over voters' confidence and election integrity.§ \nBut even though these procedures have been postponed, Ingram's previous rule changes are still a cause for concern in the November election and have caused repercussions in two election cases currently being litigated. Here are some of the problems＃ \n1) Waiver of laws requiring a Partial Manual Recount audit \nIngram waived the requirement to conduct a manual count in 1% of the election precincts or 3 election precincts, whichever is greater. This was waived in all 254 counties the day after the March 2016 Primary. The timing is significant because during the primary there were 1,743 move votes than voters in Hill County in the Republican Primary. The margin of victory was 225 in Texas House District 8 that contains Hill County. In calling for a criminal investigation, Ingram noted that it appears ※6 or 7 voters voted more than once in the election and one voter voted as many as four times.§ Yet he waived the partial manual recount audit requirement statewide and he has waived other audit and monitoring procedures. \n2) Waiver of laws requiring printing of paper backup results tapes \nIngram's waivers issued in 2014, 2015, and 2016, appear to be in direct contradiction of state election laws 65.004, 65.014, 66.022, 66.023, 66.024 and the Judges Handbook. These rules require 每 ? ※Three original tally lists shall be maintained at the polling place to record the number of votes received for the candidates§ ? ※On completion of the vote count, the presiding judge shall prepare the returns of the election for the precinct§ with ※total number of voters§, ※total number of votes§ with the presiding judge signing each of the 3 copies to certify. \nIngram also issued waivers for requirements that a ※zero tape§ be printed from the machines at the beginning of election day and a ※tally tape§ printed at the close of election. His letter states that ※the process of printing of the zero tape and tally tape at each countywide precinct location could take hours in both the morning and the evening of election day.§ \nSo expediency for election workers takes precedent over requirements enacted by the legislature for integrity of elections. And if a favored vendor can't perform to the law, the law is waived. \nIf proper procedures had been followed to ensure that the machine was at a zero state, instead of waived by Ingram, the Hill County issue of 1,743 more voters than votes would not have happened. The vendor in Hill County, ES&S eventually identified the source of the extra votes saying ※An audit of the log report from the central paper ballot scanner showed that the hard drive had not been properly cleared of all ballots cast before scanning Early Voting or Election Day ballots＃There are established election protocols which should be followed to prevent this type of reporting error.§ \nBut the Director of Elections is waiving those ※established election protocols§. Ingram's waver of legal requirements & his improvised solution of ※printing a zero tape at the county warehouse prior to election day§ opens the door for error and fraud. \n3) Ignoring laws requiring printing of legally sufficient ballot images for recounts \nThe Secretary of State Election Division claims that ※cast vote records§ are equivalent to ※ballot images§. As you can see, the cast vote records are very different from ballots and are not uniquely numbered. \nThe Texas Constitution, Article 6 每 Suffrage, Section 4 says ※In all elections by the people, the vote shall be by ballot, and the Legislature shall provide for the numbering of tickets and make such other regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the purity of the ballot box.§ \nYet the machines by vendors Hart InterCivic and ES&S, certified by Ingram, do not provide uniquely numbered ballots per state recount laws and don't provide other components of a legal Texas ballot. \n4) Ignoring laws that allow poll watchers to monitor all election activities such as the printing of paper audit logs for computerized result tabultion \nTexas Election Code, Sec 33.056 says a ※watcher is entitled to observe any activity conducted at the location at which the watcher is serving.§ \nAffidavits from two official poll watchers for a candidate in Dallas County (with official Poll Watcher signed forms) detail how they were ※repeatedly obstructed from monitoring multiple election activities at the Dallas County Central Counting Station such as ballot scanning, vote transfer, ballot transfer, computer activities, ballot tabulation, and viewing the elections computer line printer.§ They state that they were ※repeatedly treated disrespectfully, obstructed and blatantly ignored§ by the election officials, and voting machine vendor before being thrown out after the officials spoke with the Texas Secretary of State Elections office. \nHostility to election monitors, like Ingram's refusal to answer our questions, destroy the public's confidence in the honesty of the process 〞 and rightfully so. \nIngram's Connections To Arkansas, Kutak Rock, Rose Law Firm & Hillary Clinton \nAccording to a public information request of Ingram's Secretary of State personnel file, Ingram left private practice and moved to Little Rock Arkansas, taking a job with the law firm, Kutak Rock, LL. At Kutak Rock, he worked under the managing partner, Gordon Miller Wilbourn who had been a partner with Hillary Clinton, Vince Foster and Webster Hubbell at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas in the 1990's. The Wilbourn family is a large donor to the Clinton Foundation and the Hillary Clinton campaign. \nIngram left Kutak Rock to return to Texas when he was hired by Gov. Rick Perry's appointment office in 2008 to oversee statewide political appointments for various courts, boards & commissions. \nIngrams's career moves are interesting. In just 10 months, his journey from private practice in Texas through Arkansas Clinton-cronies and back to Texas government resulted in pay cuts with each move and his salary being cut in half. In 2012, Ingram, was promoted to Director of the Election Division in the Texas Secretary of State's Office where his salary was still 40% less than private practice. \nIngram's determination to remove paper trails and auditing procedures for electronic voting is even more troubling when we look at his connections to big Clinton donors. \nEstablishment Of Both Parties Don't Appear To Want Election Integrity \nIn one lawsuit contesting election results for Austin City Council, the County could not produce ANY ballot images as required by law to conduct a recount. Computer logs had multiple ※corruption/invalid§ errors. During discovery it was learned that the computer counted more votes than registered voters in 10 of the 12 precincts forming the district. One precinct had 100% voter turnout, another was just 2 registered voters shy of 100% in spite of only 32% and 17% county-wide turnout in the general and runoff elections. \nThe County Democrat Party has financed legal opposition to the lawsuit and a Republican judge claimed there was no evidence for election irregularities. \nThere are some positive developments, however. The Republican judge has now been voted off the bench of the solidly Republican County and state legislators have taken up the question of election integrity that has so far been ignored by Governor Abbott's office. \nState Senator Bob Hall said, ※Due to an increasing number of complaints, it is time for the Texas Elections Division Office to take immediate and decisive action to rescind all waivers issued by that office＃and instruct all Texas counties using electronic voting systems to consistently adhere to all election laws＃§ \nVoters, regardless of political affiliation, should reject policies and personnel that compromise honest, transparent elections. For example, Chambers County in Texas recently announced electronic voting would be suspended until the glitches affecting voting machines could be corrected. It's time to remove Keith Ingram as Texas Director of Elections and replace easily hacked electronic voting machines with paper ballots.",

    "text": "Trump Warns Of ＆Vote Flipping' On Machines \"People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?\" Steve Watson | Infowars.com - October 27, 2016 Comments \nGOP Nominee Donald Trump, who has for weeks warned that the election could be rigged against him, shot out a tweet Thursday indicating that he is aware of reports of machines ＆flipping' to register votes for Hillary Clinton, when voters choose Trump. \n※A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas,§ Trump tweeted. \n※People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?§ A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on? \n〞 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2016 \nAs Infowars has highlighted , there have already been numerous reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. \nWhile election officials have dismissed the reports, suggesting ＆user error' is to blame, tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time. \nLarry Norden, a voting technology expert, told NPR that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed. \n※Over time, as people vote, that calibration becomes less and less accurate,§ Norden noted. \nDuring elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines ＆flipping'. Indeed, the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as The Simpsons drew attention to it: \nMeanwhile, The Washington Post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression, bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering Trump's ＆rigged' election claims. \nCallum Borchers, author at the Washington Post blog The Fix writes: Since the final presidential debate last week, many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to Donald Trump supporters: Your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election Nov. 8. A day later, the Times's Upshot blog increased Clinton's chances of winning to 93 percent , an all-time high. On Monday, Politico's Ben Schreckinger wrote that ※ Donald Trump's path to an election night win is almost entirely closed .§ Here at The Fix, Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake wrote that ※ Donald Trump's chances of winning are approaching zero .§ These are accurate, statistically sound statements. But they are something else, too. Declarations that Trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the Republican nominee's warning that the ※rigged§ election could be ※ stolen from us .§ \nThe latest polls, which Trump insists are rigged due to oversampling, show Clinton with a double digit lead. \nHowever, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook has warned that Trump's suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are ※absolutely right.§ \n※We've seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before Election Day.§ Mook said, urging Clinton supporters to vote. \n※Make no mistake. With only 10 percent of votes cast, Donald Trump could win this election,§ Mook said. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

    "text": "Wikileaks Email: Clinton Operative Thinks ※Black Voters Are Stupid§ David Brock accused of \"elitist racism\" Paul Joseph Watson - October 27, 2016 Comments A new email released as part of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accusing Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being ※stupid§. The email , sent to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and another Clinton ally CEO Roy Spence, centers around a discussion of a Bernie Sanders campaign ad which featured ※many black faces§. Back in January, Clinton operative David Brock caused consternation within the campaign when he publicly claimed that Bernie Sanders didn't care about black people. Budowsky is not impressed with Brock's outburst, writing in the email, ※Brock makes the cardinal mistake of those who bring politics into disrepute with voters. He tells a lie that people will know is a lie, and insults the intelligence of black voters with a kind of elitist racism that Bill and Hillary Clinton should not be seen with.§ ※I guess Brock's plan is that black voters are stupid and will not watch the ad and believe his lie,§ writes Budowsky. ※I cannot think of anything more desperate, more stupid and more self-destructive than David Brock lying about the Bernie ad and playing a seamy brand of the politics of race using the tactic of deceit on her behalf,§ adds the The Hill and Huffington Post columnist, before offering to write a campaign ad for HIllary to counter the Bernie Sanders ad. The email once again underscores the Clinton camp's paranoia about not being able to authentically connect with African-American voters in a way that Bernie Sanders could. Some black voters have been reluctant to support Clinton as a result of her support for a 1994 crime bill that resulted in the mass incarceration of young black Americans, whom Hilary referred to at the time as ※super predators§. \nSUBSCRIBE on YouTube:",

Paul Joseph Watson - October 28, 2016 Comments \nDo you stand ※with her§ nuclear holocaust? \nHillary Clinton has vowed to use military assets against Russia if Moscow is merely suspected of having engaged in a cyber attack. \nHillary Clinton has already proven that she is a sociopathic warmonger. Her bloodthirsty zeal to overthrow Gaddafi in Libya directly led to the rise of ISIS, the international migrant crisis and a wrecked continent. \nIf she is elected, Hillary will push for arming jihadist rebels in Syria with even more sophisticated weaponry and a no fly zone over the country 每 an effective declaration of war on the Syrian government and its ally, Russia. \nA vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for world war three. Jill Stein: \"If Hillary gets elected, we're going to war with Russia, a nuclear armed power.\" pic.twitter.com/0mp7JVSWy1 \n〞 Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) October 19, 2016 \nHillary Clinton is George W. Bush 2.0 每 that's why she is supported by a plethora of ＆Never Trump' neo-cons who are salivating over the prospect of getting back into power and launching new wars of aggression. \nExcept this time the enemy won't be Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi or any other third world nation with a flimsy, virtually non-existent army. \nThe enemy will be Russia 每 a country with a 3 million man army and a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons. \nIt is important to not fall prey to normalcy bias. Just because there hasn't been a major conflict in most our our lifetimes doesn't mean it can't happen. The history of humanity is the history of warfare. \nA vote for Hillary is a vote for World War 3. \nMake this message go viral by sharing this video . Because nuclear war is progressive. https://t.co/bwYbmZbkrN pic.twitter.com/90UGR46I1g \n〞 Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) October 28, 2016 \nSUBSCRIBE on YouTube:",

Maryland Trump Supporter: They Switched My Vote to Hillary 每 https://t.co/FkNiEUOZHH pic.twitter.com/dalY9KBWtj \n〞 Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) October 28, 2016 Noting that she had seen reports on the news of votes being flipped, the woman said, ※I went in and voted a straight Republican ticket and thank God I went back and checked and they had switched my vote from Trump to (Hillary).§ She said that she had to get the vote changed back by alerting election officials, who simply told her to vote for a second time. ※I went back the second time and made sure they didn't change it,§ she concluded. As we reported earlier this week, voters in numerous areas of Texas have made a series of complaints that votes are being switched from Trump to Clinton. One election official responded by claiming the problems were caused by voters not understanding how to use the machines properly. ※Typically, we've found it's voter error with the equipment,§ Frank Phillips, Tarrant County's election administrator, told WFAA . ※Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates ＃ or do something with the wheel＃.There is not an issue with the equipment.§ However, Trump supporters continue to point to the reports as evidence that vote fraud may be taking place. \nSUBSCRIBE on YouTube:",

Find out why Clinton is ahead of Trump and may likely win October 31, 2016 Screen-capture: NBC News/YouTube ( INTELLIHUB ) 〞 What the American people need to realize is that their vote literally does not count. That's right there is absolutely no point in voting as an individual because the election results are only based on electoral votes. \nYour vote is only a poll, to let the Establishment know what brand you like best, brand A or brand B, that's all, just like Jordan Maxwell pointed out in the documentary film SHADE . \nYou see, 270 electoral votes are needed for either candidate to win. \nRight now, according to a website tracking the electoral votes, Hillary Clinton is in the lead with 258 electoral votes, compared to Donald Trumps 157 and there are only 127 remaining on the table for grabs. So you can see that as of yet, Hillary Clinton has the Electoral College wrapped up as expected. This is how Bush won the 2002 election.",

    "text": "Financial Markets , Gold , Housing Market , U.S. Economy bond bubble , dollar collapse , economic collapse , stock bubble admin \nPosted from St. Martin (the French side, of course!). I kind of expected this to happen, as close friends and colleagues can attest. Trump is not only NOT going ※drain the swamp,§ he's populating it with a different breed of swamp monster. His choice for AG is a red-neck, right-wing senator from Alabama who, 80 years ago, would have been a member of the inner circle of the Third Reich. Ditto for the names that have been floated for Secretary of State. As for Treasury Secretary, the names floated for the position bear the unmistakable mark of the Wall Street beast: $6$6$6. They are every bit as vile, if not worse, than the thieves that moved through there the last 12 years. Jamie Dimon? Steve Mnuchin? Give me an F-ing break. \nIt is what it is. Out with the old, in with new old. James Kunstler penned another epic post that deserves a thorough perusal: For all practical purposes, both traditional parties have blown themselves up. The Democratic Party morphed from the party of thinking people to the party of the thought police, and for that alone they deserve to be flushed down the soil pipe of history where the feckless Whigs went before them. The Republicans have floundered in their own Special Olympics of the Mind for decades, too, so it's understandable that they have fallen hostage to such a rank outsider as Trump, so cavalier with the party's dumb-ass shibboleths. It remains to be seen whether the party becomes a vengeful, hybrid monster with an orange head, or a bridge back to reality. I give the latter outcome a low percentage chance. \nThe stock market continued a stunning move higher last week despite evidence of widespread financial market turmoil signaled by the bond and currency markets globally. With evidence mounting everyday that the U.S. economy continues to deteriorate, the behavior of the U.S. stock market can only be explained as being a product of the enormous pool of liquidity created by the Fed 每 printed money plus rampant credit availability 每 that piled into any and all stocks moving higher. This will ultimately turn into a momentum move in the other direction that will inflict serious damage on the system. 每 Excerpt from the latest Short Seller's Journal",

    "text": "Rigged Election: US Blaming Russia For Future ＆Falsified Voter Fraud' by IWB ﹞ October 26, 2016 \nby Baxter Dmitry \nUS officials claim that if anybody produces evidence of voter fraud in the coming weeks, it will be a Russian plot to undermine people's confidence in American democracy. \nBlaming Russia for the Democratic National Committee and Clinton Foundation hacks proved so successful at distracting Americans from the contents of the WikiLeaks emails that US officials are now attempting to blame future evidence of voter fraud on Russia too. \nThe claims are being disseminated to the public via mainstream media pipelines as we speak. Reuters, operating as an organ of state propaganda, reported the claims by anonymous U.S. officials on Thursday: \n※ The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. \nBut hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. \n\nThey said that they did not have specific evidence of such a plan, but state and local election authorities had been warned to be vigilant for hacking attempts. ※ \nThe keyword in the second quoted paragraph is ※ some. § Truth mixed with lies. Reuters, in collusion with the state, are using confusion, paranoia and heavy-duty spin. Dizzy yet? \nThe mainstream media has now laid the groundwork to ensure that if Clinton wins the election and is accused of voter fraud, any evidence provided to substantiate the claim can be instantly dismissed as fake Russian propaganda and not investigated properly. \nIn essence, if the ruling party says that a specific document is false, then without question, it must be false. The Democrats will dismiss evidence of voter fraud as another ※conspiracy theory§ and ※Russian plot.§ \nThe Democrat establishment has spent months attempting to deflect from the content of WikiLeaks emails by alleging the source of the hack was Russia. Now they are attempting to capitalize on the narrative by blaming future voter fraud evidence on Russia as well.",

    "title": "Let's Be Clear 每 A Vote For Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For World War 3",
    "text": "Let's Be Clear 每 A Vote For Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For World War 3   \nBy Michael Snyder \nIf you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as ※dangerous§ and ※temperamental§, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. \nSomeone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are ※going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton§＃ \nOn Syria's civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. \nClinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ※safe zones§ on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. \n※What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,§ said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. ※You're going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.§ \nIn order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. \nAnd in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. \nAccording to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences＃ \nRussia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. \n※I wouldn't put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,§ Clapper said, speaking with CBS' Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. \nOf course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria ※would require us to go to war§ ＃ \n※Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,＃ That's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not going to make.§ ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) \nBut Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. \nYou see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn't for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no ※humanitarian crisis§ in Syria at all. \nThanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won't have anywhere to hide. \nSo the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. \nOne recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates ＃ \n※Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation 每 at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,§ Putin said. \n※Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,§ Putin noted. \nAnyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. \nAnd even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania ＃ Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America's troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. \nIn addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia＃ \nAfter accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. \nA rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. \n※The US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,§ said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen S?reide. \nMost Americans aren't aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. \nBut in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation ＃ \nRussian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. \nAt the Kremlin's Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. \nThe country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. \nI know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. \nIn my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn't know how the election would turn out. \nAt this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. \nIf you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don't do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. \nIf the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years.",

    "text": "Taki's Magazine October 28, 2016 \nThis election is going to have unprecedented political infidelity. A good 20 percent of husbands for Trump predict their wife won't vote with them. This is wrong for a number of reasons but the biggie is, a family is supposed to be a cohesive unit. He can't have his better half canceling out his vote. Even if a husband wants to vote badly〞say, for Hillary〞his wife should stand by her man and make the same mistake. Nobody's saying there can't be discussions and women shouldn't have their own political beliefs, but the final decision comes down to the guy paying the bills and she should abide by that. This is counterintuitive because we live in a feminist fantasyland, but it's really the same as deciding where your family is going to live. A married couple agree where they're going to go based on what's best for the kids. If he gets an amazing job offer in Cleveland but she's a city gal from Manhattan, she needs to accept that Ohio is best for the future of their family. Voting is the same. You're deciding where the country is going to go based on what's best for future generations. \nUnfortunately, this is not happening. A map of America ※if just men voted§ is almost completely red, whereas a map of America ※if just women voted§ is almost completely blue. The maps don't differentiate between married and single, but judging by this massive split in what gender likes what candidate, we can assume the married map would be similar. Single people are a lost cause anyway. The women vote almost exclusively out of spite. They are voting for Hillary because she has a pussy, they hate Trump because he grabbed one, and they elected Obama because he makes theirs wet (they elected Trudeau because he is one). As for single men, I'm not convinced they even vote . There are also stay-at-home dads and situations where the woman is the breadwinner. This is awkward, but if you've made her the patriarch then her husband (a.k.a. wife) needs to vote with her. For the most part, however, we're talking about a home where the father makes the lion's share of the money and the woman's contribution is using her magic powers to make babies. They have a symbiotic relationship where they're both utilizing their greatest strengths. Patriarchs are best at driving, so he's the helmsman. He doesn't want to fight about it because he doesn't want to rock the boat, but for her to turn starboard while he's going port is to split everything in half and now the whole family is drowning. Voting against your husband is a tiny divorce.

He is a close friend and confidant of the Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump. \nIn fact, Stone is working with the Trump campaign to organize volunteers. Isn't that special? \nMost campaigns, of course, organize the volunteer brigade to knock on doors and chat with people about the candidate. Some gather willing folks to make calls, reminding people about when and where to vote. \nThe Trump campaign, as the world knows, is definitely not your average campaign. Definitely. Roger Stone is not the typical campaign advisor either. \nStone is reaching deep into the basket of deplorables to find each volunteer. His plan is not to have them get out the vote. In fact just the opposite is true. \nApparently the Republican nasty man is running an anti-voter fraud group which ironically calls itself ※ Vote Protectors .§ In spite of the fact that there is absolutely no evidence of widespread or significant voter fraud, Donald Trump continues to insist that the whole election is ※rigged.§ \nIn his effort to stop the ※rigging§ of the polls, Stone has asked every Vote Protectors volunteer to wear a specially designed identification badge. Each one is supposed to engage in a fake ※exit poll,§ asking people who they chose. Election officials believe that these actions would confuse and intimidate voters. \nOf course they would confuse and intimidate voters. That's why Roger Stone wanted those things done. \nUnfortunately for Stone, however, the Huffington Post got wind of his plan and asked him about it. At first the head of the deplorables refused to explain how he intended to have the group reach its goals. \nSo the Huffington Post went online to the site to volunteer. What it found was eye opening, to say the least. The ※volunteer§ who signed up on the site followed the instructions for generating a very official looking ID badge. It would surely fool many voters if worn by someone taking an ※exit poll.§ Trump Loyalists Planned Voter Intimidation Using Fake ID Badges, Fake Exit Polling https://t.co/8ojaEGZiD6 \n〞 Cheri DelBrocco (@cdelbrocco) October 26, 2016 \nThe Huffington Post reports that there was no limit to the number of badges they produced, as you can see above. \nThe instructions on the site also told each volunteer that he or she must: ※＃commit to go out in November and post their YouTube and Periscope streams to the [Vote Protectors] website, organized by state and district, as well as enter actual exit poll survey response.§ \nThat's right. Volunteers for Roger Stone's ※Vote Protectors§ were supposed to videotape people at the polls and upload them. You can just imagine how this would impact Black or Latino voters. Or, Heaven forbid, voters from Arabic backgrounds. \nWhen asked specifically about the ID badges, Stone emailed this to the Huffington Post: ※I have ordered them taken down. Bad idea, as is video taping. First I have heard of it. I am only interested in a valid, scientifically conducted exit poll.§ \nOf course he is. On a ※scientifically conducted§ exit poll, done by a bunch of volunteer Trumpsters with no training and a profound bias. \nFabulous. \nThat basket of deplorables just keeps getting bigger by the day. \nWatch this incredibly outrageous video of Roger Stone and the crazy pants Alex Jones talking about how Hillary is planning to steal the election. \nFeatured image via YouTube screegrab .

    "text": "Congressman Tells Cub Scouts He'll Vote Trump ＆No Matter What Crazy Things He Says' (VIDEO) By Richard Marcil on October 27, 2016 \nNew video from a Cub Scout meeting in Kansas shows Representative Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) pledging to support his party's presidential candidate, Donald Trump 每 no matter what. ※I'm going to be supporting the Republican nominee, no matter what crazy things he says.§ \nYoder's admission is shameful enough on its own. But the worst part is his audience 每 a group of Cub Scouts, aged 7-10. \nThe video, taken October 11, was recorded shortly after the release of the now-infamous ※ Pussy Tape § in which Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. Yoder even made a joke about Trump's scandalous comments: ※A-ha! Which parent put him up to that? Is there a hot mic in here? Well, I'm a Republican, so I'm going to be supporting the Republican nominee, no matter what crazy things he says.§ A Lesson On ＆Spin'每 For the Kids! \nYoder dishonestly suggested that the child was not curious enough to ask the question on his own. But in fact, kids are quite aware of the impending election. An informal survey of teachers found high levels of youth anxiety 每 especially among racial and ethnic minorities 每 due to Donald Trump's inflammatory rhetoric. \nHis reply also dishonestly implies that he's somehow obligated to vote along party lines. But the many Republican defections from the Donald Trump camp prove that is untrue. Yoder could have used the opportunity to teach the Scouts that they should always do the right thing, even if it means refusing to do what is easy and expected of you. Instead, he towed the party line. \nPerhaps Yoder needs a reminder from the Cub Scouts about where his loyalty should lie. According to the Scout Oath , decent citizens should pledge: ※On my honor I will do my best, to do my duty to God and my country＃§ Damage Control \nYoder is running for a fourth term in a suburban Kansas City district. His team is already running damage control on the tape. Yoder spokesperson, C.J. Grover, played the remarks off as evidence of Yoder's ※quick wit.§ ※Anyone who knows Kevin knows that he utilizes his quick wit to connect with voters. All this video shows is Kevin continues to be out in the community taking all questions from anyone who wants to ask them, whereas his opponent has been hiding in his basement hoping his financial backers in D.C. can steal him a victory.§ \nFeatured image: screengrab via YouTube video .

    "text": "APOCALYPSE NOW: Trump Voters Warn Of ＆Revolution' If Clinton Wins By Andrew Bradford on October 28, 2016 Subscribe \nThere's nothing wrong with being passionate when it comes to your political beliefs and the candidate you support. In an electorate as deeply divided as we currently see in this country, you expect no less. But ask yourself this question: If your candidate loses, are you ready to take up arms and try to overthrow the government? For some who ardently support GOP nominee Donald Trump, the answer is a resounding yes. \nTake for example Jared Halbrook, who lives in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and told the New York Times : ※People are going to march on the capitols. They're going to do whatever needs to be done to get her out of office, because she does not belong there. ※If push comes to shove, (Clinton) has to go by any means necessary, it will be done.§ \nRoger Pillath said he also sees violence on the horizon if Clinton is elected: ※It's not what I'm going to do, but I'm scared that the country is going to go into a riot. I've never seen the country so divided, just black and white 〞 there's no compromise whatsoever. The Clinton campaign says together we are stronger, but there's no together. The country has never been so divided. I'm looking at revolution right now.§ \nAs Trump continues to talk of the election being ※rigged,§ his words are having an effect on people like Paul Swick, who had this ominous warning: ※If she comes after the guns, it's going to be a rough, bumpy road. I hope to God I never have to fire a round, but I won't hesitate to. As a Christian, I want reformation. But sometimes reformation comes through bloodshed.§ \nRetired truck driver Alan Weegens envisions a very dark future for the United States and says he's ready to do whatever is necessary: ※I am not going to take my weapon to go out into the streets to protest an election I did not win. But I think that if certain events came about, a person would need to protect themselves, depending on where they lived, when your neighborhood goes up in flames.§ \nSee if you can recall the last time we heard this kind of violent talk which led to actions by far right nuts who were inspired to be ※heroes§ in their own minds. The year was 1995 and Bill Clinton was President. Timothy McVeigh parked a rental truck loaded with explosives outside the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and killed 168 innocent Americans, including children.

    "text": "Louisiana Election Officials Seize Voting Machine Illegally Placed In Private Room For ＆VIP Voters' (VIDEO) By Stephanie Kuklish   \nElection officials in Louisiana seized a voting machine on Wednesday that's purpose was to serve ※VIP§ voters so that they could skip voting lines, an illegal and suspicious tactic by the longtime Jeffrey Parish Registrar Of Voters, Dennis DiMarco. \nThe unique voter machine was kept in a conference room and only allowed ※special§ citizens to use it. Allegedly it was meant for the purpose of allowing citizens such as police officers, fireman, emergency physicians, and anyone else with a job that may keep them from being available during voting hours. \nMeg Casper, a spokeswoman for Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler's office, told the Huffington Post that the machine was seized immediately and the user's names have been retrieved. Schedler wrote a letter to DiMarco stating : ※I feel this action is necessary to preserve the transparency and integrity of early voting and to promote confidence within the general public regarding the voting process.§ \nLouisiana state law says that : ※Each voting machine shall be placed inside the polling place and shall be in full view of the public from the time the election begins until the last elector has voted. The commissioners and watchers shall be stationed near the voting machines, and the commissioners shall regulate the admission of the voters thereto, and each shall always be in full view of the other election commissioners and watchers and, as far as possible, of the public.§ \nApparently the Registrar of Voters, DiMarco, wasn't aware of his own laws and replied with a statement saying: \n※There was no fraudulent votes; they're no allegations about that. No allegations of anyone voting who was not entitled to vote. Now, we've turned down everybody. So no one gets preferential treatment. But again, that means that those firemen, those policemen, are standing up rather than maybe doing their duty on the streets.§ \nIf Louisiana requires every police officer, firemen, and other emergency personnel to work every day all day long then maybe we should be taking a look at that instead of refusing to acknowledge the law. \nOr maybe the Republican party should stop pushing so hard for limited early voting hours after fanning the flames of Republican presidential nominee's unfounded claims that the election is rigged.

    "text": "IRONY ALERT: First Person Arrested For Voter Fraud Is A Trump Supporter By Andrew Bradford on October 29, 2016 Subscribe \nEver since the public opinion polls began showing him behind in the 2016 race for the White House, GOP nominee Donald Trump has alleged that the political system and election is ※rigged.§ He has even recommended that his supporters show up at polling places to observe what is taking place and assure the election isn't ※stolen§ via voter fraud. \nWhich brings us to Thursday in Des Moines, Iowa. Terri Lynn Rote voted early at an election office in her hometown. A few hours later, Rote then went to another polling location and attempted to vote a second time. She was arrested and charged with first-degree election fraud, a Class D felony. \nThe irony is almost too much to stomach, isn't it? \nPolk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald said it's the first time in 12 years he can remember ever having to report potential voter fraud to the authorities. \nWhat Trump and other Republicans fail to say when they warn of voter fraud on the left is that based on the demographics of the American electorate, there is no need for Democrats to try and commit fraud when it comes to a national election. In fact, it is far more likely that the GOP will have to try to cheat or intimidate voters (with restrictive voter ID provisions and by cutting back the number of polling places or early voting days) in order to remain competitive. \nIt should also be noted that when Trump was winning in the Republican primaries, you never once heard him scream about anyone trying to cheat or rig an election. It was only after his own numbers began to slip and he found himself behind by as much at 14 points to Hillary Clinton that such talk began. \nSo, Donald, what say you about the election being rigged in light of Terri Rote? Donald? Hmm＃guess that silence tells us all we need to know. \nHere's the Donald alleging that the election is rigged against him: \nFeatured Image Via Des Moines Police Dept.

    "text": "DNC Renews Lawsuit Against RNC Over Voter Intimidation (VIDEO) By Lisa Bonanno on October 29, 2016 \nAccording to a document filed in federal court this past Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee is taking Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee to task over their plans to ※monitor§ the polls. \nThe filing says that the RNC is violating a consent decree by: ※＃ Supporting and enabling the efforts of the Republican candidate for President, Donald J. Trump, as well as his campaign and advisors, to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 Presidential Election. Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be ＆rigged' based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in ＆certain areas' or ＆certain sections' of key states. Unsurprisingly, those ＆certain areas' are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside.§ \nThe document goes on to name some of the specific quotes and directives that Donald Trump has given supporters. It also mentions that: ※Following the third presidential debate, Trump's campaign manager told a reporter that the campaign was working to combat purported voter fraud by ＆actively working with the national committee, the official party, and campaign lawyers to monitor precincts around the country.'§ \nThis shows that the RNC is involved in this effort, which has already begun . Trump ally Roger Stone organized ※Vote Protectors,§ who are instructed to conduct ※exit polls.§ Initially, the volunteers were asked to upload video of voters, create ID badges and wear red shirts at specific polling places. After journalistic inquiry , Stone said he would change his tactics. He simply created a new website, but that's another story. \nThe Democratic National Committee is going after Trump and the RNC for violation of a consent decree signed in 1982. At that time, the RNC was involved in voter suppression in targeted areas known to vote predominantly Democrat. They hired off-duty sheriffs and police officers to go to polling places in those areas displaying a sign stating ※This area is being patrolled by the National Ballot Security Task Force.§ There were other activities, such as the challenge of individual voter registrations in certain communities. \nThe consent decree forcing the RNC to cease its 1982 ※ballot security§ activities resulted from a successful DNC suit. The decree expires next year. In the current suit, the DNC seeks to renew it for another eight years. \n34 years later, we have an old tactic re-branded by the same party to do the same thing: intimidate minority voters. The DNC opens fire against RNC voter intimidation tactics \nFeatured Image via screenshot from YouTube video Connect with me",

Democrats have always taken the black vote and black Americans for granted. The black voting bloc has always been expected by Democratic candidates, despite the Democratic Party's long history of gross racism. One has to wonder how much damage has been caused to that relationship by the WikiLeaks revelations over the past few months. No wonder Hillary wants to drone Julian Assange!",

    "text": "Print \nIn the final 11 days leading up to the monumental 2016 presidential election, reports have filtered in that thousands of immigrants are headed for the U.S.-Mexico border to illegally enter the United States. Their motivation is crystal clear, according to CBS News York , which explains the sudden influx: \n※The smugglers are telling [the masses of illegal] if Hillary [Clinton] gets elected, that there'll be some sort of amnesty, that they need to get here by a certain date,§ [Border Patrol Agent Chris] Cabrera said. ※They're also being told that if [Donald] Trump gets elected, there's going to be some magical wall that pops up overnight and once that wall gets up, nobody will ever get in again.§ \nCabrera added that they've encountered up to 1,000 immigrants along [the Texas city of] McAllen's stretch of the border some days. \nIt's not just Donald Trump's imagination that Democrats are manipulating the immigration process to register as many Hillary Clinton voters as possible. Bloomberg notes independently that a number of American cities are opening allowing illegals to vote. In some cases, an ad hoc workaround is being impemented to give the process an air of respectability.",

We've seen massive amounts of corruption involving every level of Hillary's minions all the way up to the Chair of the Democratic National Committee. Apparently, nothing is off limits when they're doing Hillary's bidding, and now they have a new racket that is going to make criminal voter fraud a whole lot easier. \nElection fraud has already become a big concern again this election cycle as voting machines are reportedly ※malfunctioning§ and switching votes in favor of Hillary. One Texas county was even forced to abandon the machines altogether and go to paper ballots. \nThere has been some progress in protecting the integrity of our elections by implementing voter ID laws, but Democrats have been fighting it tooth and nail. Hillary and her minions claim that it's racist or oppressive or some crap to expect United States citizens to possess and show picture ID to vote. It's apparently not a problem, though, to ask them to show ID for a pack of cigarettes or to board a plane or for a hundred other things. Go figure. \nEven as they were whining about how requiring photo identification to vote is oppression, Hillary's minions were already working on a solution. They knew there was a good chance they would lose the fight against states who wanted to stop dead ※Democrats§ from voting, and so now, we're seeing the Hillary supporters' machine at work. \nHillary's minions have taken to the internet to advertise and sell near-perfect replicas of state driver's licenses. According to an ad on craigslist which has now been removed, the entire purpose of purchasing one of the fake ID's is specifically to fraudulently vote for Hillary Clinton . \nThe text on the ad reads: ※ I can provide you with a high-quality fake ID it comes with holographic and also barcode [sic]. This can be used anywhere, we are offering special deals for people who will go to the polls on November 8th, we need to get Hillary in office . We only meet in a public location and accept cash only no trades. All states, cities, and addresses available. Buy 2 get 1 free. Election special free IDs* ( you have no say as to information on these, they are already pre-populated and must be used to vote on Nov. 8th) § Screenshot captured before removal of Craigslist ad for Fake IDs. ※ Fake IDs Let's Get Hillary Elected 每 $1 (Detroit). ※ Lower portion of screenshot captured before removal of Craigslist ad for Fake IDs. ※ Fake IDs Let's Get Hillary Elected 每 $1 (Detroit). ※ Larger view of photo included in the Craigslist ad. selling forged driver's licenses. ※ Fake IDs Let's Get Hillary Elected 每 $1 (Detroit) .§ Notice how the same face is used to create several IDs from varying states. \nIt's extremely disturbing to hear over and over again about the lengths to which Democrats and Hillary and her minions (including the liberal media) will go in order to try to secure her election as president. Have they no shame, pride, or confidence at all? Maybe they all realize 〞 like the rest of us do 〞 that Hillary really is that awful of a person , in every possible way, and the only chance she has to get into the White House as president is to steal the election . They must know it. Otherwise, why would they try to hard to use fraud and corruption to get her there? \nIf true-blue, red-blooded Americans have anything to say about it 〞 and we most certainly do 〞 Hillary ＆Rotten' Clinton is not moving back in our house at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. We now know that during the years and even decades that we've suspected mass corruption and fraud within the Democrat Party, we were right and we will never be fooled again.",

    "text": "＆Monster Vote' Is Happening, Early Voting Poll Numbers You Can't Know Posted on October 30, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics Share This Hillary Clinton (left), Trump rally (middle), Donald Trump (right) \nFor weeks, the mainstream media has pushed a false narrative that Hillary Clinton is so far ahead and this election is over. Luckily, there are some who realized this move is straight out of the leftist playbook and called out the press for what they were up to 〞 lying. No longer can they report Hillary being ahead by double digits. In what's been dubbed ※the monster vote,§ here are the poll numbers they do not want you to see. \nWhat's the monster vote? That's the silent majority in this country who are going to overwhelm all of the liberal talking heads' expectations. We started to see the monster vote for Donald Trump in the primaries, where he attracted voters to register as Republicans to vote in the primaries. \nNow, we have early voting taking place in some states, and those numbers are proving, here comes the monster vote . Gateway Pundit reported: \nDONALD TRUMP Senior Communications Advisor Jason Miller shared some very positive news on FOX News on Sunday morning. \nJason Miller told Melissa Francis the Trump Campaign is up 100,000 votes in Florida and 35,000 votes in North Carolina compared to four years ago . Trump rally (left), ※We're gonna need a bigger basket§ meme (right) \nLet's break that down further to see what it means. Based on all the early voting in Florida, which is a must win for Trump, right now, it's Trump = 51.5%, HRC = 48.5%, which is incredible. Democrats typically rule early voting, and in 2012, at this point, Barack Obama was up by 5% in Florida. Now, for the monster vote news for Florida, as broken down by The Conservative Treehouse (CTH): \nThis is YUGE because Obama won early voting in FL by 5 points in 2012 and after election night he won the state by less than 1 point. ( LINK ) Actual in person voting on the traditional election day, November 8th, will heavily favor Donald Trump. \nFolks, based on what we have data wise so far and the fact that the 16 counties didn't start early voting until the 29th of October (which favors Trump based on data above), I can now soundly say that we will win FL by 8 to 10 points (54.5 每 46.5). The monster vote is coming. \nThe mainstream media will continue to slant the early voting numbers for Hillary, so don't listen to them. I guarantee you, they are taking a sample and then skewing it. Remember, Democrats almost always vote early, but Republicans don't usually vote until election day. Based on what these smart guys at CTH are saying, North Carolina, Ohio, and Nevada will go Trump and even Minnesota and Wisconsin are slanting towards Trump, which would be just icing on the cake since those states usually go Democrat. \nTune out the mainstream media on the polls and get ready for the monster vote. It seems to be the best-kept secret in this election. The monster voters are the forgotten men and women across this country who haven't voted in years and are now sick and tired of Washington's corruption invading their life. \nThey're back with a vengeance, and they have hope that we can turn this country around. We all agree it will be pure joy on election night as we watch Hillary and her minions break down in disbelief that We the People took our power back and we will never give it away again.",

    "title": "Trump Voter Arrested When Officials See What His Shirt Says About Hillary",
    "text": "Share This A Trump supporter was arrested after polling officials spotted what he was wearing at an early voting station in Bulverde, Texas. \nAs the election draws near, liberals are attempting to stifle any votes for Hillary Clinton's increasingly popular opponent, Donald Trump, hoping their felonious candidate can pull off a win. However, what a Trump supporter was recently arrested for wearing shows just how desperate leftists really are to stop the conservative vote. \nWhen Brett Mauthe woke up last Monday morning, he was eager to get his ballot in early and secure a vote for Trump while the Republican nominee's approval rate continues to rise. The 55-year-old Texan got dressed, put on his favorite hat, and headed out the door. Unfortunately, he didn't realize that it was his choice of clothing that would not only prohibit him from voting but also land him inside a jail cell. \nKSAT 12 reports that Bulverde polling officials confronted Mauthe when they spotted him wearing a pro-Trump hat and a t-shirt that read ※Basket of Deplorables,§ a sarcastic reference to Hillary's crude remarks about conservative voters. Apparently unaware that he wasn't allowed to sport campaign gear inside the polling station, Mauthe removed his hat but refused to turn his shirt inside out. It was then that the officials called the police and had him arrested. \nMauthe was placed in cuffs and charged with electioneering and loitering as local police threw the book at the confused man. Like Mauthe, voters at the same polling place were shocked that wearing such clothing is not only prohibited at the polls but can result in a misdemeanor charge . Brett Mauthe, 55, was charged with electioneering and loitering for wearing a ※Basket of Deplorables§ t-shirt mocking Hillary Clinton's crude reference to conservatives. \n※I don't feel like you should be preaching to anybody, but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate,§ Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote Wednesday morning. ※I'm kind of shocked because I think that's part of the freedoms that we're voting for. ※ \nWhile Mauthe is wholly responsible for not following the rules, although he may not have understood the severity of his violation, we're betting that career politicians are keen on the election rules. Proving that the liberal elites are above the rules, Hillary herself was caught breaking the same law as Mauthe but with a very different outcome. This year, Hillary was caught campaigning in front of a North Carolina polling station and Bill was busted thanking Hillary voters over a loudspeaker within 20 feet of a Massachusetts polling station. Unlike Mauthe, neither of the Clintons were arrested. \nMad World News reported that Hillary was captured on video campaigning in front of Raleigh's Chavis Center, a polling place in North Carolina. The female candidate walked straight up to early voters, greeting them and snapping selfies as if she was at one of her own rallies. Of course, the scheming doesn't end there. \nIn March of this year, Bill was busted thanking ※those of you who are supporting Hillary Clinton§ with a loudspeaker while within 20 feet of a Massachusetts polling station. His massive police detail also blocked civilians from entering the precinct to vote. The Daily Kos reports that even though electioneering, which is Mauthe's crime, is only a misdemeanor, interfering with voting rights is a felony, which is exactly what Bill did. As expected, Mauthe was arrested and charged for his crimes, but Bill was fawned over and even abetted by police officers. \nAlthough Mauthe definitely broke the law when he refused to remove his shirt, his real crime is that he wasn't a Hillary supporter. If he had been a liberal celebrity or the husband of a Democratic politician, he would've been allowed to block voters and openly campaign for his choice right there in the station. \nThe bias is clear a?? not only are the electronic polling machines switching votes for the left, influential Democrats are potentially changing views right there in the polling stations. It's undeniable that, regardless of the results, the American people don't stand a chance at a fair election.",

    "text": "Videos New Lawsuit Challenges Efforts To Stamp Out African-American Vote In NC North Carolina is 'ground zero in the intentional, surgical efforts by Republicans to suppress the voice of voters' | November 1, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! President Barack Obama casts his ballot during early voting at the Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center in Chicago, Ill., Oct. 25, 2012. (Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) \nWith just over a week to go before Election Day , the North Carolina NAACP on Monday filed a lawsuit to stop what it describes as a Republican-led effort to snuff out the African-American vote. \n※This is our Selma and we will not back down and allow this suppression to continue,§ said Rev. William Barber II, president of the organization. \nAccording to the civil rights organization, wrongful challenges to voters' eligibility are happening in at least three counties〞Beaufort, Moore, and Cumberland〞and are disproportionately affecting African Americans. \nThe suit (pdf) states that ※a small number of individuals have recently challenged the registration of approximately 4,500 voters, based exclusively on mass mailings that were returned as undeliverable.§ A press statement from the group says the challenges stem from ※a coordinated campaign led by individuals with GOP ties.§ Registration cancellations based on that alone is in violation of the National Voting Registration Act, the group says. \nThe complaint, filed Monday in federal court in the Middle District of North Carolina, states, ※in many cases, voters purged by Defendants still reside at the addresses where they are registered to vote, or have moved within the county and remain eligible to vote there.§ \nThe suit is asking for the wrongfully canceled voting registrations to be restored. \nAmong the plaintiffs is James Edward Arthur Sr., who's lived in Beaufort County his entire life. He is African American and has been a registered voter for five years. He was among the over 130 voters in that county to have his registration cancelled based on the challenge of an undeliverable mass mailing〞even though he moved within the county. \n※I did not receive notice from the State or Beaufort County that my voter registration had been challenged, or that a hearing had been set to determine whether I would remain on the State's list of eligible voters,§ he said, referring to the procedure that election officials must follow when a challenge has been made. \n※If I knew my right to vote was in jeopardy, I would do whatever I could to protect it. I want and plan to vote in the upcoming election, but I am concerned that since my registration has been canceled I will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted,§ he added. \nAnother plaintiff is James L. Cox, also African American and another lifelong resident of Beaufort County. His voting eligibility was also part of the en masse challenges〞even though he currently resides at the address on his voting records. \nThe suit〞filed months after a federal appeals court said the state's voter ID law was created ※with discriminatory intent§〞says that though African Americans make up less than 26 percent of the county's residents, they account for over 65 percent of the challenges. \n※The Tar Heel state is ground zero in the intentional, surgical efforts by Republicans to suppress the voice of voters,§ Barber added. ※We're taking this emergency step to make sure not a single voters' voice is unlawfully taken away.§ \nThe suit also comes as voters in the state take part in ※the Souls to the Polls§ initiative . \nMontica Taulmidge, a former organizer in Raleigh, told CBS it's ※an opportunity for people to come with their congregations right after church and to vote as a community of faith.§ \n※Our communities of faith are super important to us so being a part of a church family,§ she said, ※and saying we are going to be civically minded, we are going to be civically active and engage in this process, is a huge deal for a lot of people.§ This work by Common Dreams is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike International License.",

    "text": "Videos Greens & Libertarians Rally To Secure 5% Of The Popular Vote Ahead Of Election Day Though third-party nominees received increased attention from both voters and the mainstream media in this year's election cycle, they're still up against the historic tendency of voters to ultimately cast their votes for Republicans and Democrats. | November 7, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson speaks during a campaign rally at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa. First it was Bernie Sanders. Now it's Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein being sized up by many young people. With a day to go, Hillary Clinton has struggled to convince young voters that she deserves their support. \nAUSTIN, Texas 〞 Although some indicators suggest the 2016 presidential election could be closer than initially expected, prominent third-party candidates are urging voters not to waver in their support for options outside the traditional two-party system. \nAlternatives to the Democrat and Republican nominees, such as the Green Party's Dr. Jill Stein and former Gov. Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party, received unprecedented attention in this election cycle as dissatisfaction with the two major candidates soared to unprecedented highs. \nBut third parties traditionally struggle to hold the public's interest as Election Day approaches , with many voters eventually falling in line with one of the two major parties. While some polls previously suggested a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton, others are now showing a tighter than expected race , which could also scare off some potential third-party voters. \nA RealClearPolitics analysis of polls which include all four candidates, which was last updated on Wednesday, suggested Johnson would net about 4.1 percent of the popular vote and Stein could get as much as 2.1 percent. \nIf either candidate can net 5 percent of the popular vote on Nov. 8, they'll unlock up to $10 million in additional federal funding for future elections. That money could unleash more political power by enabling the Greens or Libertarians to reach more potential voters. \nWhile some polls indicate that Johnson's unprecedented support is fading in the eleventh hour before the election, Johnson tweeted on Thursday that his support was especially strong among voters who identify as independent.

Encouraging her supporters to push for 5 percent of the vote, Stein continued: ※As corporate, mainstream political pundits scoff at and attack my ＆unlikely' candidacy, we have been traveling throughout the country, talking with people from all walks of life and organizing on the ground with a fast-growing base of support from ＆unlikely' voters: millennials, indebted students, poor and working class people, immigrants, people of color, and many others who have given up on the two establishment parties out of disgust and frustration.§ \nGreen Party backers have also used the hashtag #InvestYourVote on Twitter to encourage voters to take a long-term view of the potential effectiveness of voting for a third-party candidate: \"Fear of Donald Trump is not enough for me to support Clinton, with her record of corruption.\" \n〞 Green Party US (@GreenPartyUS) November 1, 2016 \nOn Oct. 31, Stein and Johnson faced off in a televised debate hosted by PBS' Tavis Smiley, marking an unusually mainstream forum for the candidates. During the program, the pair reacted to the renewed FBI investigation into Clinton's emails and other recent developments in this often stressful election . Watch ※ Dr. Jill Stein and Former Gov. Gary Johnson : § \nAnother alternative candidate receiving an unusual level of attention in the lead-up to Election Day is Evan McMullin, an independent from Utah who formerly served as a CIA operative and as a policy advisor to Congress. Polls and electoral analysts have even suggested McMullin has a chance of winning an electoral vote in the state, where some members of the Church of Latter Day Saints see him as a conservative alternative to Republican candidate Donald Trump. \nOn Oct. 29, one of McMullin's tweets went viral after Trump told Fox News that he'd ※never heard of§ McMullin and accused him of being a ※puppet§ of Bill Kristol, the neoconservative founding editor of The Weekly Standard. \nIn a response which has been retweeted over 18,000 times, McMullin fired back: ※Yes you've never heard of me because while you were harassing women at beauty pageants, I was fighting terrorists abroad.§ . @realDonaldTrump , Yes you've never heard of me because while you were harassing women at beauty pageants, I was fighting terrorists abroad. https://t.co/hNDTWn3HPN \n〞 Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) October 30, 2016 Be Sociable, Share!",

    "text": "Videos Should Third Parties Support ＆Vote Pacts' To Avoid ＆Spoiling' Elections? Unlike other vote swapping schemes which pair a voter in a swing state with a voter in a ＆safe' state, a vote pact pairs voters across party lines who each promise to cast their ballots for a third-party candidate instead.   Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein, foreground, meets her supporters during a campaign stop at Humanist Hall in Oakland, Calif. on Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016. \nAUSTIN, Texas 〞 Third-party candidates are often accused of acting as ※spoilers§ by siphoning votes from the two major parties' nominees and potentially tipping the balance in an election. \nPerhaps the most notable example of this is Ralph Nader. The former Green Party candidate is frequently accused of helping George W. Bush win the 2000 presidential election by diverting votes which otherwise would have gone to Democratic nominee Al Gore, although this theory has been disproven many times . \n※A lot of people have basically grown to depend on the confines of the two-party system and have a hard time getting their brain around a constructive, strategic path out of it,§ Sam Husseini, a political activist, told MintPress News. \nHusseini proposed an alternative strategy in which voters form ※voting pacts§ across party lines. For example, a Democrat and a Republican might each agree to vote for a third-party candidate of their choice, rather than the two major parties' candidates. The strategy reduces the potential for ※spoiling§ votes, as long as voting pacts don't cross state lines, because each of the major candidates loses voters equally. \nHusseini operates the website VotePact.org to encourage this method of vote sharing or vote pairing. Letter in Wash Post: ※VotePact Offers Voters a Sensible Alternative§ 〞 how #NeverTrump & #NeverHillary can pair up: https://t.co/HB3CtnGGdi \n〞 votepact (@votepact) August 30, 2016 \n※It has the potential for being a catalyst for genuine realignment and perhaps even for a victory for a so-called third party or independent candidate creative enough to use such a strategy,§ Husseini said. \nThird-party candidates frequently urge voters to follow their conscience rather opt for one of the ※lesser of two evils§ selected by the two-party system. As Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein frequently says , ※We need to stand up and fight for the greater good like our lives depend on it.§ \nHusseini said he'd like to see third-party candidates embrace vote pacts instead of dismissing spoiler claims. He suggested they should also urge their supporters to form vote pacts as a way to safely support third-party movement building. Here's how Husseini imagines the idea being pitched by a candidate: ※There's a way out of this. You feel like you gotta vote for Clinton because you hate Trump. I get that. Lots of people are like that and lots of people are on the other side. Well, they should pair up and both vote for me.§ \nHe continued: ※I've never seen any third-party candidate do that, which is why I think they're going to remain in single digits§ in the popular vote. \nOther forms of ※vote swapping§ have been proposed during this and previous elections, usually seeking to pair a voter from a swing state with a voter from a state ※red§ or ※blue§ state. The voter in the so-called ※safe state§ agrees to vote for a third-party candidate in return for securing a vote for their preferred candidate in a state where the election is in play. \nThis ※safe state§ strategy was especially popular in 2000, when voters sought to trade Nader and Gore votes. That election prompted a court case in which the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that that vote swapping is ※clearly protected by the First Amendment.§ \nLast month, Husseini told Bustle's Am谷e Latour that the ※safe state§ strategy just ※kicks the can down the road.§ Third parties often hope to secure 5 percent of the popular vote in presidential races, which would unlock millions in additional federal funding for future elections, but Husseini thinks by embracing vote pacts they could potentially win elections outright. \n※The other so-called ＆strategies' are basically a way of minimizing the so-called ＆damage' of third-party runs,§ he told MintPress. \nWhile Husseini said he hopes alternative candidates will someday make vote pacts a key part of their campaign strategy, he also stressed that it isn't too late for voters to embrace the idea in the 2016 election. Vote pacts require mutual trust between political opponents, so he recommends forming them with family members, close friends, and coworkers across party lines. \nHe also said voting pacts could spur political change by encouraging people to engage in challenging political conversations across party lines rather than simply shutting out opposing views. \n※Instead unfriending that guy who said he might vote for Trump because he hates Clinton, reach out to them.§ Be Sociable, Share!",

    "text": "by Lambert Strether \nLambert here: Howard Dean, back in 2003 and before he lost his mind, said : ※I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks. We can't beat George Bush unless we appeal to a broad cross-section of Democrats.§ Of course, such a gross violation of liberal class and cultural markers could not be permitted, and Dean was forced to grovel and apologize by the dominant identitarian wing of the Democrat Party and then, when his fifty-state strategy won Democrats control of Congress in 2006, instantly defenestrated by Rahm Emanuel, among others, and his organization gutted by Tim Kaine . When Chomsky asks ※Why are we failing to organize these people?§ he's asking a question to which Dean already gave the answer. \nClinton, of course, thinks that organizing ※these people§ is a bad idea, which is why she called them ※deplorable§ and ※irredeemable§ (and if you're a Christian, as Clinton purports to be, ※irredeemable§ means irredeemable). So do many of her supporters, who seem to labor under the twin delusions that (a) ※these people§ will go away on the morning of November 9, and that (b) calling them, in various ways, stupid is, as a strategy, full of #win. If Clinton wishes to fail during a legitimacy crisis, she and her supporters should go on exactly as they have begun. Personally, I'm not a ※worse is better§ guy (too much suffering), but I confess I see little prospect of the dominant faction in the Democrat Party changing its ways, Dean, Chomsky, or no. \nBy Alexandra Rosenmann, AlterNet associate editor.

    "text": "Scott \nIt's really amazing to see how little of the blame is going to Clinton herself. It was her decision to set-up a private email server. It was her decision to serve as Secretary of State while accepting millions from foreign governments. It was her decision to get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars while unofficially running for President. It was her decision to call millions of Americans deplorable. \nWe have very little idea of what a Trump presidency will amount to. My best guess has been that he will be a Jimmy Carter cubed in Berlusconi packaging. \nRecall that even though Carter has been the best former President of the modern era, he came to Washington as an outsider with his Georgia team. Despite having ben a governor and thus knowing how to draft legislation and get bills passed, he famously got little accomplished despite having a Democratic party majority in the House and Senate. \nTrump is likely to spend his first year, and conceivably his entire Presidency, with all of the Democratic party and enough of the Republican party against him to stymie him, fighting for the right to govern. And that assumes he has an agenda beyond the very few goals he has articulated consistently: getting out of ※bad§ trade deals and entering into better ones; reducing immigration and deporting many undocumented immigrants (and building his famed wall); investing heavily in infrastructure; making NATO members pay their share of its budget (the theoretical level, 2% of each nation's GDP, is largely footed by the US); cutting back our involvement in overseas conflicts; cutting taxes; and repealing Obamacare. \nThe only initiatives where the Republicans might back him solidly are cutting taxes and ending Obamacare, and even then, given the lobbying power of Big Pharma and the health insurers, the Republicans might not be as willing to pull the trigger on Obamacare as all their kvetching would lead you to believe. \nThere is one more Trump campaign promise that will serve as an important early test of his seriousness as well as his survival skills: investigating Clinton. Even if Obama pardons her, as our Jerri-Lynn Scofield has predicted, it will be critical for Trump to carry out a probe of the Clinton Foundation's business while Clinton was Secretary of State. \nIf Trump is to cut the cancer of the neocons out of the policy establishment, he has to have them on the run. It is a reasonable surmise that Clinton's enthusiasm for war was due at least in part to heavy Saudi support of the Foundation. Showing that American's escalation in the Middle East, which Obama tried with mixed success to temper, was due in part, and perhaps almost entirely, to the personal corruption of the Secretary of State, would keep the hawks at bay, particularly if other prominent insiders and pundits were implicated in Clinton Foundation influence-peddaling. \nIt will be hard for Trump to do much to alter the course of the military-surveilance complex unless he can hamstring the warmongers. Just as Warren has argued relative to bank regulations, ※personnel is policy.§ If Trump is a fast learner, he'll see that that is just as true on the foreign policy front. \nFinally, those on the left need to turn the blame cannon aimed squarely at them back on the professional hacks who are truly responsible. Despite their tiresome chest-beating about meritocracy, these Acela corridor bubble-dwellers are constitutionally incapable of holding their fellow club member accountable. Their preening self regard repelled hard-working Americans who'd done the right thing, as in gotten an education, and if they were older, launched a career, bought a house and started a family, only to struggle harder and harder while seeing any vestige of security and hope of improved living standards erode. And unless they were at the top of the professional classes, they felt defeated by not being able to pay for their kids to go to college and being uncertain as to how to advise them with their educations and job prospects. \nThe Democrats under Clinton and Obama abdicated the duty of the elites, which is to improve the conditions for, or at least limit harm to, the members of the communities they lead. Even Bill Clinton did remember that the most important duty for a Democrat is to create jobs, even if he did so by presiding over a rise in household debt and a stock market bubble. \nYoung people, who poll well to the left of their elders, have inferred a lesson that the labor movement forgot: the exercise of power includes being willing to inflict punishment in the form of withholding support. Look at how diminished organized labor has become by casting its lot with the feckless Dems who've sold them out again and again. Hillary tried the Clinton ※They have no where to go§ trick one time too many, kicking the left after she only narrowly beat Sanders. And the left decided to return the favor. She made clear she has no intention of representing them. They heard her message loud and clear and acted accordingly. \nAs reader aab : \nThe big question to me is, take over the hollow shell of the Democratic Party, or crush it with a new party. Is it possible to take over the Ds 〞 as weak as it is now as a party 〞 without being corrupted and co-opted? I now hate my former party to such a degree, I find myself recoiling at having anything at all to do with it. But given all the institutional constraints, it still may be smart to try; the answer is above my pay grade, as they say. \nThis is an important question to consider as we see how the Democratic party responds to this well-deserved defeat. 0 2 0 0 0 0",

    "title": "George Soros on tape: Trump will win popular vote in 'landslide,' but Hillary Clinton's electoral victory is already 'a done deal'",
    "text": "Even Republican politicians and former politicians are telling Trump to knock off such talk .But, as usual, Trump's shrewdness and defiance of standard political decorum 每 in which the \"opposition\" party merely rolls over and surrenders in the face of Democratic pressure 每 is winning the day.None other than billionaire investor and longtime Democratic supporter George Soros has said that the fix is literally in for the election, in favor of Clinton 每 no matter how much of the popular vote, and from which battleground states, Trump captures.As reported by Top Right News and other outlets, during a recent interview with Bloomberg News , Soros 每 a Democrat mega-donor 每 openly admitted that Trump will win the popular vote in a \"landslide.\"However, he said that none of that would matter, because a President Hillary Clinton is already a \"done deal.\"In the interview, which is now going viral, Soros says with certainty that Trump will take the popular vote, despite what the polls say now (which are completely rigged to oversample Democrats ), but not the Electoral College, which will go to Clinton.When the reporter asks if that is already a \"done deal\" 每 that Clinton will be our next president no matter what 每 Soros says \"yes,\" and nods his head.Is Soros just making a prediction out of overconfidence? Or does he truly know something most of us don't know?In a recent column , Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, says that Soros and Democrats have \"bribed electoral college representatives\" in a bid to \"fix\" the election outcome in favor of Clinton. In truth, that would be the only way it could be done, short of massive voter fraud through electronic balloting, as some reports have already claimed .Adams further pointed out that Soros was one of the main money men behind the Black Lives Matter movement, which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country 每 some of which has led to the deaths of several officers already.Soros also funds left-wing websites and groups that locate, pay and deploy volunteer \"agitators\" at Trump rallies, to start fights and engage in physical violence against Trump supporters (acts that the establishment media then blames on Trump ).But aren't electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that elector's district? No, they're not. Nine-nine percent of electors have done what they're supposed to do throughout our history, but this is no ordinary election Per Archives.gov , there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote. Rather, these pledges fall into two categories: State law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political parties.In the past, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution doesn't require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please and, therefore, respective political parties may \"extract pledges from electors to vote for the parties' nominees,\" Archives.gov notes. Some state laws hold that \"faithless electors\" could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid ballot, and could then be replaced by a substitute elector.\"The Supreme Court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the Constitution. No Elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged,\" said Archives.gov.The site notes that throughout our history, 99 percent of electors have voted as required. But this is no ordinary time, and it's no ordinary election . And Democrats (and the establishment media) have already proven that they will do anything to stop a Trump presidency. Plus, establishment Republicans don't want Trump either, so you can bet they wouldn't balk at or challenge the buying off of electors. Sources:",

    "text": "November 2, 2016 \nA group of about 200,000 White Holland turkeys in a gigantic shed at a farm in Ohio is now debating whether or not to vote in favour of Thanksgiving. The vote to be made next week by pecking once at a pile of grain for ＆Thanksgiving' or twice for ＆Something Else' comes after bitter arguments in which claims and counter-claims were made about the availability of dust for bathing in over the turkeys' long-term (i.e. three-week) future. \nMany turkeys have deplored the resulting divisions, which have seen elevated levels of pecking in the once harmonious community five miles from Wapakoneta. ＆I've lived here all my life, y'all,' said turkey hen Wanda-Mae Cabrera. ＆What was it we were deciding on again? Me an' my folks before me, we all lived here, yes we did.' \nVoting for Thanksgiving means that the turkeys will be able to build a wall from their own faeces to deter any incoming poultry from Kentucky from trying to get into the shed, once they have mastered the intricacies of building a wall from their own faeces. Many also believe that this will make the shed great again, as it hasn't been great for a long time but definitely used to be. They also said they liked the sound of a new farmer called Donald, who recently grabbed a pussy-cat that raided the shed before it could do any damage. \nSome turkeys prefer to carry on not celebrating Thanksgiving because the past 244 generations had not and had all gone away to live happily on a farm somewhere else, apparently. ＆One labourer said we will get a right stuffing either way,' said anti-Thanksgiving turkey DeMarius Jackson, aged 28 weeks. ＆Well, that's democracy. I imagine.' \n＆I ain't having no goddam American Bronzes sharing my shed, no sirree,' raged White Holland cock Burl Griffin CCXXVI. ＆Before you know it, they'll be gobblin' around your hens, stealin' your water and sayin' you can't worship the Great Spotlight in the Roof no more. I ain't breedist but have you seen the size of their wattles? I like my shed the way I like it, so I'm for Thanksgiving, sure thing. What is Thanksgiving, anyway?'

    "text": "November 7, 2016 \nToday the world awaits the results of a record-breaking American vote against the worst Not President of the United States (NPOTUS) in history, instead electing by default someone it is already ashamed of. In the past twenty-four hours, the two front-runners have finally ceased in their last-ditch attempts to sway swing voters to detest them less than the other contemptible candidate. \nThe UK has recently emerged from a similar vote on the basis of limited information on two outcomes where the consequences were indeterminate and the candidates literally lied for Britain. Most voters voted for the thing they least understood because the consequences of the other thing sounded dire. The politicians then found themselves in the invidious position of defending and implementing the thing they really didn't vote for, or would not have given an ounce of integrity. \nSympathetic British voters have been sending advice and best wishes to their American counterparts via social media. Tristram Hopgood, a civil servant from Winchester gave the least-twattish words of advice: \n※Ideally, one would avoid having a massive, bungling-man child with ridiculous yellow hair and no concept of poverty or morality anywhere near the process. If this is unavoidable, at least never allow him to act unsupervised and offer him a pretend steering-wheel on the family car and hope he is delighted with that. \nIf you end up voting in a scary female super-villain who makes her shoes and cloak from the skins of puppies, it is best to dig a big hole and hide in it until the financial melt-down blows over. It should be noted that the lady in question is likely to show an unhealthy interest in all things nuclear within twenty-four hours of gaining office, so best dig that hole good and deep.§ \nMedia outlets world-wide have had an unexpectedly easy time of it preparing the front pages for the next day, with headlines reading: ※America, what HAVE you done?§, regardless of the outcome.

    "text": "JUDGMENT DAY: The One Reason Why Every Christian And Jew In America Should Vote For Donald Trump The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 is a public law of the United States passed by the 104th Congress on October 23, 1995. It was passed for the purposes of initiating and funding the relocation of the Embassy of the United States in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.   8, 2016 Jerusalem will be the portal through which God administers His Justice to a depraved world. Jerusalem will be His ※burdensome stone§ with which He judges the world. \n※The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.§ Proverbs 16:33 (KJV) \nAs Americans who love this country, it is absolutely crystal-clear who we should vote for. Only one candidate's campaign slogan is Make America Great Again, only one candidate says that they will # DrainThe Swamp . I think you get the idea. But you can be a patriotic America and not be a Christian, right? Trump: It's Time To Drain The Swamp In Washington, D.C 每 Five-Point Plan For Ethics Reform So is the a compelling, overarching reason why a Bible believing Christian should vote for Donald Trump? Yes, there is \nDonald Trump has made as part of his platform a promise to move the American Embassy from its current location in Tel Aviv to its new location in Jerusalem. In fact, it was signed into law in 1995, read this: \nThe Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 is a public law of the United States passed by the 104th Congress on October 23, 1995. It was passed for the purposes of initiating and funding the relocation of the Embassy of the United States in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , no later than May 31, 1999, and attempted to withhold 50 percent of the funds appropriated to the State Department specifically for ※Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad§ as allocated in fiscal year 1999 until the United States Embassy in Jerusalem had officially opened. The act also called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city and for it to be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel. Israel's declared capital is Jerusalem, but this is not internationally recognized, pending final status talks in the Israeli每Palestinian conflict . The United States has withheld recognition of the city as Israel's capital. The proposed law was adopted by the Senate (93每5),and the House (374每37). \nContained in the Jerusalem Embassy Act is a prophecy bombshell , perhaps when you skimmed through it just now you missed so let me break it out for you, ready? \n※＃called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city and for it to be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel. \nNow please pause at this juncture and think about what that means for a Bible believer. Do you know why the Palestinians have, for 20 years, refused to accept the so-called Two State Solution ? Because the Two State Solution does not give Jerusalem to Palestine, it gives it to its rightful owner, Israel. The Battle of Armageddon will be fought over who will gain control of, not just Israel in general, but the rights to Jerusalem in particular! The word ※Jerusalem§ appears 811 times in your King James Bible, think that God places a lot of importance on it? \n※Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.§ Zechariah 12:2 (KJV) \nGod says if you go against His city of Jerusalem that it will mean ※lights out§ for you. Jerusalem will be the portal through which God administers His Justice to a depraved world. Jerusalem will be His ※burdensome stone§ with which He judges the world. \n※And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.§ Zechariah 12:3 (KJV) NTEB PRESENTS: Donald Trump, Jerusalem and Bible Prophecy \nWe just launched a YouTube channel for Bible teaching and prophecy, and here is our very first video of our radio show on Donald Trump and Jerusalem. Please subscribe to our YouTube channel by clicking here , thank you! \nBible believers, let's be honest. God is not really so much concerned with any election in any nation so much as He is with His nation of Israel and its capital city of Jerusalem. That's where God's passion is, that's where His heart is. Genesis says that if you want God's blessing, then bless His nation of Israel and bless His chosen people, the Jews. \n※And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.§ Genesis 12:3 (KJV) Christian, do you need a reason from the Bible to vote for Donald Trump? \nI just gave you two, very powerful and very Biblical reasons to vote for Donald Trump. He will move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, and he will love Israel and God will bless us for that. Now, get up, put your ※big boy§ and ※big girl§ pants on, and go out and vote . \nNot for the ※lesser of two evils§ as some erroneously assert, but for the only candidate that will fulfill Bible prophecy   \nDonald J. Trump.",

The DNC's lawyers asked a New Jersey federal judge to hold the Republican Party in contempt for violating a 35-year old consent decree to enforce the Voting Rights Act, and to issue an injunction to enforce the terms of the agreement, which will force Republicans to cease their efforts to suppress votes in minority communities during this year's general election. The DNC lawyers cited Donald Trump's frequent statements to supporters, as well as one of vice presidential nominee Mike Pence's speeches where he admitted that the RNC was directly coordinating ※ballot integrity§ initiatives, which are explicitly banned under the agreement. \nTrump's overt actions to call his supporters to watch polls in ※certain areas§ are a classic attempt to concoct an illegal ※ballot security program,§ which is why we exclusively predicted this lawsuit could happen three weeks ago. Last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) weighed in with an op-ed published in the Washington Post urging the party to take action. This week, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump also took it upon themselves to lodge a new FBI complaint , over Trump's voter suppression campaign which violates the same Voting Rights Act provisions covered by this recent DNC action which could land Republicans involved in the illegal campaigning 每 like Roger Stone 每 in criminal court. However, the Democratic Party's action is based on a legal decision, so it's going to be expedited in court, and is likely to yield a rapid order from the federal judge against the Republican party and Trump. \nHere's a summary of what the DNC's lawyers filed in federal court today: (see below for complete document ) \nDefendant Republican National Committee (※RNC§) has violated the Final Consent Decree＃ by supporting and enabling the efforts of the Republican candidate for President, Donald J. Trump, as well as his campaign and advisors, to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 Presidential Election. Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be ※rigged§ based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in ※certain areas§ or ※certain sections§ of key states. \nUnsurprisingly, those ※certain areas§ are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside. Notwithstanding that no evidence of such fraud actually exists, Trump has encouraged his supporters to do whatever it takes to stop it〞※You've got to get everybody to go out and watch . . . and when [I] say ＆watch,' you know what I'm talking about, right?§〞and has been actively organizing ※election observers§ to monitor polling stations in ※certain areas.§ Trump has even encouraged his ※watchers§ to act like vigilante law enforcement officers. \nAlthough certain RNC officials have attempted to distance themselves from some of the Trump campaign's more recent statements, there is now ample evidence that Trump has enjoyed the direct and tacit support of the RNC in its ※ballot security§ endeavors, including the RNC's collaboration on efforts to prevent this supposed ※rigging§ and ※voter fraud.§ \nIn a rally in Denver, Colorado, on August 3, 2016, Trump's vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, admitted that the RNC was directly coordinating with the Trump campaign on ※ballot integrity§ initiatives, stating that ※the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee are working very very closely with state governments and secretaries of states all over the country to ensure ballot integrity.§ \nThe RNC's support of Trump's efforts to recruit ※watchers§ who are intended to intimidate voters at their polling places violates this Court's Consent Decree as modified in 2009, which explicitly forbid the RNC from engaging in so-called ※ballot security§ measures directly, indirectly, or through its agents or employees. The RNC's conduct also violates the Consent Decree under well settled law prohibiting defendants from evading court orders by acting in concert with third parties. \nDonald Trump's master of dirty tricks, Roger Stone is specifically named in the complaint because is the very same political operative, whose minority voter intimidation tactics landed the Republican party in hot water for 35 years in the first place for rigging a close New Jersey gubernatorial election! (which was won by the GOP candidate) \nRoger Stone, one of Trump's top advisors, has amplified Trump's message. Stone was a key advisor to the 1981 campaign of former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, in which a ※ballot security§ force wearing black armbands engaged in widespread voter intimidation in Newark, Camden, Paterson and other minority neighborhoods in the State, leading to this very action and the Consent Decree that Stone is helping to violate today. \nStone is currently running a website called ※StopTheSteal.org§ that is actively signing up Trump supporters to ※volunteer§ to fight ※voter fraud.§ #StopTheSteal is a popular hashtag among Trump supporters on Twitter, and Stone's group maintains an active Facebook presence. On October 23, 2016, Stone sent out a (now deleted) message via his Twitter feed deliberately designed to mislead Democratic voters by representing〞using Secretary Hillary Clinton's likeness and logo〞that supporters can ※VOTE the NEW way on Tues. Nov 8th§ by texting ※HILLARY to 8888,§ after which voters would apparently ※receive official confirmation. \nEven worse, Roger Stone is trying to hide his voter suppression plan behind the facade of exit polling. DNC lawyers slammed the lunatic Republican political operative for his deception, and the court could order him to jail for contempt of court for his behavior. \nStone is also using social media to promote the common plan that Trump supporters〞and particularly those who have agreed to engage in vigilante ※ballot security§ efforts〞wear red shirts on Election Day. Further Stone is actively recruiting Trump supporters for ※exit polling,§ specifically targeting nine Democratic-leaning cities with large minority populations. This ※exit polling§ serves no legitimate purpose: Stone does not run a polling operation. Rather, the plain purpose of this plan is to intimidate minority voters. \nIf Donald Trump does not cease his open calls for voter intimidation, the DNC's legal action could land him in contempt of court 每 and facing a jail term. \nThe RNC is working in active concert with Trump, the Trump campaign, and [Roger] Stone to intimidate and harass minority voters in violation of this Court's Consent Decree. The Court should use its inherent contempt powers to remedy those violations , and enforce future compliance with the Consent Decree, with sanctions. \nUpon a finding that the RNC has violated the Consent Decree, this Court should issue an order extending the Consent Decree for another eight years, according to the terms of the Decree. \nRepublicans have spent a massive amount of time and money litigating to escape this Consent Decree just seven years ago, and obtained a new concession to limit it's term from infinite 每 which they agreed to in the 1980s 每 down to an eight year term which would've expired next December. Now that the DNC has taken Trump and the Republican Party back to court, it's very likely that the terms of the decree will be extended for another eight years through 2025, which will take it through the next two Presidential election cycles. \nDonald Trump has wasted the entire last month complaining about a ※rigged election§ and encouraging vigilante poll watchers to visit minority neighborhoods. Now, a federal judge will have to step in to keep his campaign from breaking election laws across the country, and the Republican party will pay the price for his ignorance of election law for years to come. \n※The notion of widespread voter fraud in modern American politics is itself a fraud,§ said the DNC, ※Every attempt to verify the presence of voter fraud has proven fruitless.§ \nRead the full complaint here:",

    "text": "Comments \nIn exactly one week from today, millions of Americans will join a mass exodus to various polling places around the nation to select new city and state officials, mayors, judges, sheriffs, congressional representatives, and of course the next President of the United States. \nHowever, some find themselves locked out of the process not from a lack of desire to participate, but because they have responsibilities as parents and can not find the time, or the resources, to leave their offspring alone so that they may go to the ballot box. \nWith lines at some polling stations reaching up to 5 to 8 hours during the primary a few months ago, in Arizona for example, voting can be rightly seen as out of reach for those who have more to do than stand around chewing the fat with their neighbors while they wait for their turn to pull a lever. \nThe YMCA has offered to do their part to help alleviate some of this inconvenience by offering free child car services on election day. The USA President and CEO of the YMCA, Kevin Washington, issued this decree : \n※Election Day is arguably one of the most important days in the U.S. this year 〞 the ultimate opportunity for Americans to make their voices heard through the democratic process. Unfortunately, many people who want to vote find it challenging because they have to take children with them. The Y's hope is that Zoe's Kids Day Out initiative enables those parents and caregivers to exercise their right to vote, and ensures children can spend their time in a safe, nurturing environment. \nNow not every single YMCA location across the nation is offering this fantastic service, so please be sure to check with your local chapter beforehand. \nWhile the YMCA deserves applause and recognition for their commitment to furthering American democracy through inclusion, what they are offering is a band-aid to a systemic problem. \nTo correct this issue entirely the American people deserve election day to be a national holiday. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) proposed a bill to create ※Democracy Day§ which would codify into law the right for all Americans to have a day off to vote. Presently there are no legal requirements for employers to give their employees time off to vote, although hundreds of large corporations have voluntarily allowed their workers time to vote without fear of penalty or repercussion, but this is not enough. \nOnly around 54% of eligible voters turned out to polling places in 2012, and that cannot be entirely blamed on voter apathy, but also on the reality that many do not have the time or resources to cast a ballot despite their deep desire to do participate in the democratic process. The American people deserve better, and our government must do more to ensure that everyone who wishes to vote has the ability to do exactly that.",

    "title": "A Federal Judge Just Ordered The RNC To Reveal Its Voter Fraud Pact With Trump",
    "text": "Comments \nFederal Judge John Michael Vazquez set a court appearance for this Thursday for the Democratic National Committee's emergency legal action to fight Republican minority suppression efforts. \nThe DNC filed suit over a generation-old consent decree last week seeking an injunction and extension of the order by eight years, which prevents illegal Republican voter suppression ※ballot security§ measures. \nThat lawsuit is looking ever more likely to succeed, resulting in an order barring Republicans across the country from targeting minority voters. The RNC's response pointedly omitted any defense of the Michigan and Pennsylvania RNC members accused of unlawful ballot security programs, who are the two key players in this courtroom drama that also involves VP candidate Mike Pence and Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. \nThe federal judge ordered both Michigan GOP Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDonald 每 Mitt Romney's niece 每 and Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Rob Gleason to submit sworn statements along with documentation of their ballot security programs by 5pm today. \nLast night, Republican lawyers tossed the two high-ranking RNC members under the bus by failing entirely to defend their actions, sworn accounts of which are due at 5pm today. The Democrat's strongest claims are against the two national RNC members who spoke to the media about ballot security programs. \nThe Washington Post wrote about the Pennsylvania GOP's plans to flood urban Philadelphia with suburban poll watchers from other counties and a legal effort to remove state law restrictions on out of county ballot watchers, while t he Michigan State GOP Chairwoman was quoted in The Detroit Free Press as saying she was directing measures in Michigan to launch a ※massive anti-fraud§ effort. \nUnder the 1982 agreement between the parties as it's been modified through the years, any ※ballot security program§ must be submitted to the court and DNC for ※preclearance§ ten days before being implemented. It seems highly unlikely that the DNC was notified of any of the four major activities the court demanded to be explained. \nThe Republican National Committee also has until 5pm today to deliver statements about minority voter suppression made in public, video recorded comments by VP nominee Mike Pence and media reports about the Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway's statements after the third and final debate. Additionally, the national Republican party has got to deliver to the court any and all agreements between the RNC and the Trump campaign that involve electioneering or polling places to the court as well. \nThe Democratic lawyers even submitted fresh evidence to the court that the RNC is involved nationally in poll security operations, which a former federal prosecutor obtained via text message during the normal course of poll watching activities. The RNC denies activity in any and all poll watching venues in their legal filings. \nThe Republican National Committee is clearly frustrated by its lengthy tenure under the key voter protection legal agreement, and you can tell from the legal filing that it wants out. However, the Republican party of Trump isn't playing by the rules, like it's standard bearer doesn't play by the rules, and now they're likely going to be punished. \nTonight, the music stops and the Republicans will finally have to answer for their dirty campaign tactics, or face the wrath of a federal judge. \nHere's the judge's complete order:",

    "text": "Comments \nA federal judge in Nevada just dragged the Trump campaign into court to answer for accusations of using minority voter intimidation tactics alongside the RNC. This case is on similar grounds as the national suit, and accuses the Nevada state GOP of violating the surviving provisions of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, seeking to deprive American citizens of their civil rights, in this case, the right to vote. \nA federal judge Tuesday ordered representatives from the Donald Trump campaign and the Nevada Republican Party to appear at a hearing in his courtroom Wednesday afternoon in a lawsuit filed by Nevada Democrats accusing them of the engaging in voter intimidation tactics. U.S. District Judge Richard Franklin Boulware also ordered the Trump campaign and state party to turn over any training materials they provided to ※poll watchers, poll observers, exit pollsters or any other similarly tasked individuals.§ \nAt the hearing, the Trump campaign and the Nevada GOP should be prepared to respond to the motion for a temporary restraining order that the Democrats requested in the lawsuit, the judge's order said. \nIn other new, there was an order issued in the national voter intimidation case against the RNC that we've been following. A federal judge just ordered the Republican National Committee to turn over their entire geographic targeting plan for poll watching after Democrats filed a lawsuit last week under a 35-year old binding legal agreement to prevent minority voter suppression by the GOP. \nAt a court hearing this morning, top RNC officials were ordered to testify under oath and reveal all knowledge about poll watching or observation programs to be enacted by RNC volunteers. \nTrump's campaign manager, Republican VP candidate Mike Pence, two GOP state party chairs, and longtime wingnut Trump operative Roger Stone all stand accused of violating the agreement by instituting or speaking about illegal ※ballot security programs§ in recordings and to the media. \nRepublicans ※ballot security§ ideas need to be pre-cleared 10 days in advance by Democrats and the federal court according to the 1982 agreement, and nowhere have GOP lawyers asserted that they asked for such clearance to date. Judge John Michael Vazquez ordered : \nORDERED that Defendant [Republican National Committee] shall also produce to Plaintiff [Democratic National Committee] no later than 5:00 p.m. EST, November 3, 2016, and file on the docket the following: An affidavit or affidavits by a person or persons with personal knowledge setting forth in detail Defendant's efforts regarding poll watching or poll observation' in connection with the 2016 Presidential Election. \nDefendant's efforts shall apply to those efforts by any employee, agent, or servant of Defendant, including volunteers and independent contractors/vendors. The affiant(s) shall be an agent, servant, or employee of Defendant. The affidavit(s) shall set forth all material terms of any such efforts, including any geographic areas which are being targeted for poll watching or poll observation and the reason(s) those areas are being targeted . Any training materials or advice, whether written, electronic, or verbal, provided to poll watchers or poll observers shall also be provided. \nDemocrats have requested injunctive relief from the court to stop Republicans from flooding polls in minority areas with ※poll watchers§ seeking to prevent, challenge or intimidate voters from casting their votes, rather than ensuring the rights of voters to make their choices. \nJust yesterday, another long list of court ordered disclosures was made public, and it included the Republican party's response to the Democrats stiff demands for sanctions and contempt of court against the Republican party's violators. \nIn the GOP's response they notably failed to defend the Pennsylvania state GOP chair (who is also a member of the RNC and therefore fully bound by the agreement), who disclosed that he was trying to change state law to allow voters from suburban counties around Philadelphia to flood into polling places in the urban areas where there's a majority of minority voters. \nOral arguments in the case are happening tomorrow, and it's expected that the court will issue a decision in the case. \nOddly, Republicans are facing these numerous lawsuits because they ※won§ a court battle over the 1982 consent decree which prevents them from intimidating minority voters, that forced Democrats to sue for state party activities separately from the national party, even though many of those activities are the same and all of the top state party officials are part of the RNC themselves. \nNow, there are three other states where the Republican state parties are facing legal action by Democrats for ballot security programs, which might violate both the aforementioned Ku Klux Klan Act or the Voting Rights Act or both.",

    "text": "Comments \nOhio has become the second state 每 after Nevada 每 to order the Trump campaign to appear in court and answer charges of voter intimidation and suppression in urban areas. \nA federal judge ordered Republican nominee Donald Trump, his longtime political advisor Roger Stone and the Ohio Republican Party into court this week to face charges of violating the Voting Rights Act and the remaining provisions of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which makes it illegal to conspire to deprive citizens of their civil rights, specifically voting rights. Cleveland.com reports : \nThe order entered Tuesday by U.S. District Judge James Gwin in Cleveland says the defendants' response must include any objections to an order ※limiting voter intimidation§ or ※limiting people at polling locations who are not authorized poll watchers or outside the polling stations.§ \nThe speed in which Gwin ordered the response, while not necessarily signaling how he feels about the case, shows that the judge is taking the accusations of voter intimidation seriously before Nov. 8 Election Day. \nThe candidate may use a wink and a nod, but that doesn't allow anyone to circumvent the federal laws governing elections. The US Constitution places all federal elections under the realm of congressional control, and the Voting Rights Act makes it illegal to intimidate or pressure anyone seeking to exercise their right to vote. \nAs the lawsuit indicates, even Ohio Republicans are reporting Trump supporters using illegal intimidation tactics in Cuyahoga County, the home of Cleveland's large minority population: \nAccording to Pat McDonald, the Republican Director of the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections, Trump supporters have already visited the county elections board identifying themselves as poll observers, even though they did not appear to be credentialed as poll observers as required under Ohio law. Indeed, Trump's fearmongering has caused Cuyahoga County election officials to express concerns of instability on Election Day and to raise the prospect of deploying law-enforcement officials to the polls if necessary to address polling place issues. \nDemocrats filed suit late Sunday night to enjoin Republicans from efforts which have included fake poll watcher badges and verbal conduct by the Trump campaign and nominee, plus efforts by Roger Stone's Super PAC to exit-poll minority polling places, when in fact Stone doesn't run a polling operation and hasn't during this year's campaign: \nThe lawsuit cites several examples of such comments by Trump made in Ohio, including a statement made at an Aug. 22 rally in Akron. ※You've got to get everybody to go out and watch, and go out and vote,§ Trump said at the rally. ※And when I say ＆watch,' you know what I'm talking about, right?§ It also references an unnamed senior Trump campaign official who told Bloomberg News that ※we have three major voter suppression operations under way.§ \nIt also takes aim at Stone and a group he controls, Stop the Steal Inc., and seeks to stop them from conducting ※exit polling§ in nine cities that historically vote Democrat. These include Cleveland, Philadelphia and Las Vegas. Stone said in an emailed statement that the polls his organizations will conduct will be scientific. ※We seek only to determine if the election is honestly and fairly conducted and to provide an evidentiary basis for a challenge to the election if that is not the case,§ he said in the statement. ※I assume the purpose of this bogus lawsuit is to distract from the voter-fraud the Democrats have traditionally engaged in.§ \nStone did not provide any evidence to back up his fraud claim. \nOhio isn't the only battleground state in the fight against Republican dirty tricks at the polls. Lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona are also being fought over the same issues , but with each local problem, such as the 94 vigilante poll watchers Roger Stone has signed up in Arizona for his Super PAC. \nThe Democratic National Committee is also suing its national counterpart, and just received extensive information about the RNC's poll watching plans and geographic targeting which is still being held under seal by the federal court. A federal judge is hearing that case in Newark, N.J. tomorrow at 10am and a decision is expected sometime later in the day. \nIronically, the multi-state litigation is happening because the national Republican Party successfully separated state level parties from the 1982 court monitoring agreement , so now the Democratic Party must file new lawsuits in multiple states in addition to the national case. However, two state party chairmen that are also RNC members have become embroiled in the national case, as well as some of the Ohio issues have been cited in the national case against the RNC. \nThe Ohio federal court has greatly expedited this case, so expect more news before election day about rulings meant to protect the general public from vigilante ※ballot security§ operations.",

    "text": "Comments \nIt's another smoking gun in the North Carolina Republican Party's fight against minority voting rights, which has now moved from the statehouse , into the courthouse and finally into election supervisory boards where newly leaked public records emails prove that the GOP's policies of racism are overtly aimed at a white's-only vote at the ballot box. \nA North Carolina Republican elections board supervisor closed down Sunday early voting specifically to appease their GOP bosses, who argued that too many African-American voters would vote together in traditional ※souls to the polls§ events. \nThis completely incontrovertible finding is sure to draw a swift reaction from the Department Of Justice's Civil Rights Division and hopefully renewed coverage under the Voting Rights Act. Of course, they won't announce anything about their investigation during the 60-days before voting finishes on November 8th. Reuters broke the news : \nBill McAnulty, an elections board chairman in a mostly white North Carolina county, agreed in July to open a Sunday voting site where black church members could cast ballots after services, the reaction was swift: he was labeled a traitor by his fellow Republicans. \n※I became a villain, quite frankly,§ recalled McAnulty at a state board of elections meeting in September that had been called to resolve disputes over early voting plans. ※I got accused of being a traitor and everything else by the Republican Party,§ McAnulty said. \nFollowing the blowback from Republicans, McAnulty later withdrew his support for the Sunday site. In an interview with Reuters, he said he ultimately ruled against opening the Sunday voting site in Randolph County because he had ※ made a mistake in reading the wishes of the voters .§ He declined to discuss the episode further. \nNorth Carolina Republicans can't win with ideas, so it appears that they have completely given up on democracy for the sake of winning. Politics isn't just a popularity contest; our electoral system is rooted in the sacred covenant that everyone has a voice in how our country is run. \nAs usual, the Republican voter suppression squad turned to the old trope of ※wasteful and unnecessary§ spending as the illegitimate justification to try and suppress minority votes. \nIn two emails, on Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, Woodhouse urged Republicans serving on county election boards to follow the ※party line§ on curtailing the early voting period. ※Many of our folks are angry and opposed to Sunday voting,§ he wrote. ※Six days of voting in one week is enough. Period.§ Keeping polling sites open for the full 17-day early voting period ※ may be wasteful and unnecessary ,§ he added. \nThe North Carolina Republican Party and its elected officials have set the gold standard for racially-driven dirty politics, and they're not even slightly afraid to banter with each other openly about it. \nFortunately, the Democratic Party fought back and while they could not prevent every instance of voter suppression, it has resulted in more early voting access rather than the GOP's plan of less. \n※Those who wanted to suppress the vote, they're going to fail,§ he said at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in Raleigh. ※Right now, there are more one-stop early vote sites in North Carolina than ever before.§ \nWith only five days remaining in the race, North Carolina poll averages show a dead heat between Democrats and their vote suppressing opponents in the Republican party in the presidential race. \nIf you witness voter suppression at the polls, don't hesitate to call 866-OUR-VOTE.",

    "title": "Federal Judge: N. Carolina Is Engaging In ※Insane§ Jim Crow Voter Suppression",
    "text": "Comments \nUntil this election, nobody knew that North Carolina was a state firmly committed to Jim Crow -style racism, but today it's been literally difficult to even pass several hours without yet another illegal scam to suppress minority votes being revealed . \nA federal judge slammed North Carolina elections officials in court today in a case filed by the NAACP , where the US Attorney General weighed in to let the bench know that if proven, the allegations would show three major violations of the National Voter Registration Act. \nDuring oral arguments, the judge explicitly called North Carolina's voter challenge law a Jim Crow law, like the ones which began apeparing in the 1890s and codified American apartheid in the South, leading to the civil rights laws of the 1960s. CBS reports : \nU.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs said multiple times the challenge process sounds ※insane.§ The NAACP says counties are violating federal law by removing voters less than 90 days before the election. ※This sounds like something that was put together in 1901,§ she told lawyers for the state. \nThe judge also said she was ※horrified§ by the number of removals in Cumberland County, which accounted for the majority of the statewide total. ※It almost looks like a cattle call, the way people are being purged,§ she told county attorney Rick Moorefield. \nClearly, election boards and politicians in North Carolina are only restrained by the spectre of federal enforcement via the pre-clearance mechanism of the Voting Rights Act. Unfortunately, since the moment that the Supreme Court decided to override the will of Congress and gut the Voting Rights Act in 2013, the impact of that willful act of judicial activism by conservative jurists has echoed in places where racism didn't arrive with Trump, but festered secretly for decades, waiting for the opportunity to strike. \nThe North Carolina officials who conducted the purge said they were following a bizarre state law, which the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has already indicated that it believes violates the National Voter Registration Act. Here's how Republicans in North Carolina purged 6,700 voters from three counties, who are mostly Democrats: \nUnder state law, any voter can challenge another county resident's registration, resulting in a hearing where the challenger presents evidence, according to a state legal filing. If local officials find probable cause, the challenged voter is given notice of a subsequent hearing. A voter who doesn't rebut the evidence can be removed. \nThe NAACP lawsuit cites Cumberland, Moore and Beaufort counties, where activists have challenged thousands of voters. The challengers include volunteers with the Voter Integrity Project, which says it wants to guard against voter fraud. In most cases cited by the lawsuit, mail to a voter is returned as undeliverable, which county boards can accept as evidence the voter doesn't live there. \nThe DOJ filed Statement of Interest on the side of the NAACP, saying that if their allegations are proven true in court, there would be three separate provisions of the National Voter Registration Act. Apparently, the judge's reaction means that they made the case: \nThree limitations on the removal of voters are pertinent here: (1) a jurisdiction may not remove voters based on a purported change of address outside of the jurisdiction using only mail returned as undeliverable and without following specific required procedures; (2) a jurisdiction may not remove voters based on a change of address within the same jurisdiction; and (3) a jurisdiction may not carry out a program of systematic removals within 90 days of a Federal election. \nU.S. District Judge Biggs is expected to rule in the case early tomorrow, but it sounds like her opinion has already been made up after today's hearing. \nNorth Carolina voters are facing unprecedented political roadblocks this year and it's all due to their state Republican party's all out war against letting people vote. It looks like the NC GOP is getting nervous that nobody will vote for bigotry laws that have damaged their state's economy, so they've got to do everything they can to rig the election by preventing people from voting.",

    "text": "Comments \nAs election day draws closer and closer, it becomes even harder to understand or tolerate Donald Trump supporters. It is conceptually difficult for many of us to understand how anyone could support Trump knowing all we know about him. But many people don't know what we know, so here's a viral list that every Trump supporter needs to read before they vote on Tuesday, courtesy of some anonymous Facebook poster. \nSo You Want Someone To ＆Tell It Like It Is'? OK, Here You Go. 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin's puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals. 3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said ※ I ＆sort of hope' real estate market tanks.§ Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person. 4. You say you're patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution's limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin＃etc 5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton's history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can't ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional. \n8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem? 9. I agree 100% if she's elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people's money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home? 11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin's little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right's anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country? 12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said ※Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,§ and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary's reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as ※super-predators§ in 1996? I don't agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don't care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.",

    "text": "Comments \nA Republican election commissioner and volunteer poll watcher has been accused of voter intimidation after he tried to drive away voters from an early-voting polling place in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The man, Stu Soffer, is a prominent Trump supporter who serves on the election commission of the majority-black Jefferson County. He has been the subject of national scrutiny before, most notably when he brandished a gun at an Election Commission meeting this Spring and then followed it up with quid-pro-quo corruption over the summer. \nNow, Soffer is facing suit in the local circuit court after Jefferson County Clerk Patricia Johnson and unrelated Pine Bluff voter Victor Johnson accused him of ※interfering with and intimidating voters§ at the Jefferson County Courthouse on October 24. According to attorney Chris Burks, who is representing Mr. Johnson, Soffer ※stood in the doorway of the early voting location and told voters to ＆shut up and go home.'§ \nJohnson states in his filings that he was waiting in line at the polling place when Soffer entered with a TV reporting crew. When a county sheriff told Soffer that the TV crew was causing a disturbance and ordered one of its members to leave, Soffer apparently blocked the door to the voting booths and yelled at the assembled citizens to ※shut up and go home.§ The suit filed by Mr. Johnson states that, ※as a result of the disruption caused by Stu Soffer and other Republicans I was not able to cast my ballot that day.§ Dozens of other likely voters were apparently turned away in similar fashion. \nSoffer resigned his position as a poll watcher in the aftermath of the incident, but the suit filed on behalf of Mr. Johnson is seeking to have him removed from his position on the county election commission as well. Soffer refused to comment when contacted by local publication Arkansas Online and a hearing date is yet to be set for the case. \nThis admittedly localized incident comes against a backdrop of a massive campaign of voter suppression targeting minority communities that is underway across the nation , usually justified by the chimera of voter fraud . Republican officials and commissioners, knowing that Trump's bigoted rhetoric will cost them the election in any fair vote, are using every dirty trick in the book to suppress minority turnout in a campaign of intimidation that a federal judge in North Carolina rightly characterized as ※insane§ and ※like something that was put together in 1901.§",

    "text": "License DMCA We're getting down to the wire. It's been a tough haul. Actually, the campaign season has felt endless. But now is not the time to drop the ball. In the days remaining, it is essential to motivate other voters who may be sitting on the fence -- or are too disgusted -- to go to the polls about why that option is not viable. Actually, it's dangerous. Their voices are crucial. Personally, it's hard for me to understand how the issue of climate change can be put on the back burner by any American. Maybe I feel the urgency so deeply because I have been writing about the environment for five years. Okay, and the mother thing definitely kicks in; wanting to protect my kid, other people's kids, and future generations. Still... it goes beyond that. It's about the birds that are dying, the wildfires ignited by droughts, the chemicals in water that was previously used for fracking and are now irrigating our country's fruits and vegetables. It encompasses the flooding, record temperatures, the lack of environmental justice for those who live in low-income communities, and the famines causing mass migration. Every time I write an article, it's with the hope of putting a spotlight on a concern folks may not know about. I hope someone new is \"going to get it.\" - Advertisement - It's tough when you are up against the big-money boys of the fossil-fuel industry and their supporters like the Koch brothers (who have their fingers in everything from Grand Canyon National Park to campaign funding). Yup, your state's Attorney General, who is elected and tasked with being the \"People's Lawyer,\" may be one of those people who have received money to jump on the lawsuit to derail the Clean Power Plan. Most of the media has dropped the ball on featuring stories on climate change and its ramifications. When guests appear on shows spouting disinformation, most interviewers don't push back. News stories with hard scientific facts don't get traction because they may not be \"sexy.\" Well, there's nothing sexy about extreme weather. Just ask people who have been the victims of hurricanes, including New York City and environs. Homes destroyed, businesses wrecked, Manhattan subways deluged with water. Unfortunately, too many Americans still don't get how climate change is the catalyst behind the challenges -- both now and in the future -- for America's health, economy, and national security. It can be hard to hear that message when ads pushed by the American Petroleum Institute and individual oil companies (like Chevron and Exxon) are busy promoting the agenda that Americans have no choice except to choose between a robust economy and clear air. - Advertisement - Okay, I'm not na????ve enough to expect the fossil-fuel industry to elevate the conversation about renewable energy. They don't want to promote what the growth of a green economy has to offer in terms of building a viable new job sector, that can implement change and employ workers. Donald Trump has made outrageous statements about the environment. Both he and Mike Pence are on the record as being climate deniers. Oh, and Trump wants to get rid of the EPA. Great. With no regulations on the table, big polluters will be able to get away with toxic dumping the same way Trump \"legally\" avoided paying taxes (see \" Halliburton Loophole \"). Who will suffer? Not the Exxon executive who didn't want fracking in his backyard . It will fall to everyday Americans who be unaware of the toxins in the air, chemicals in the products they buy and ingest, unborn children at risk in the womb, and low-income communities and people of color who live daily without environmental justice. The list goes on.",

Permalink (Page 1 of 2 pages) License DMCA \nI could have named this article \"Damage Control\" -- because it essentially is about that, related to the lobotomizing dilemma of \"lesser evil voting\". \nBut let me be clear at the outset. I have already voted for Jill Stein . I had no other choice. I am firm in my conviction that to vote for sociopathic, narcissistic, self-serving, ruthless, guileful corporatists is an unconscionable act and a major crime against my country, irrespective of the convoluted rationalization which might attempt to justify it. \nNow let me offer reasoning that goes beyond my \"morally pure\" posturing. \nThe accepted wisdom is that a vote for Jill Stein is a vote for Donald Trump. This analysis purports that anyone voting for Stein would likely be a former Clinton supporter, and such a vote would subtract from Clinton's total. \nEven though Hillary's elitist, warmongering, anti-democratic, demonstrably criminal world view is diametrically the opposite of Jill Stein's, and I can't imagine anyone who's moved by the Green Party's agenda for the briefest moment being fooled by Clinton's phony populism, for argument's sake I'll accept this proposition. \nWhile I consider both Trump and Clinton to be equally unfit for office, I do not for a moment believe they would be equally ineffective. - Advertisement - \nHillary has for good reason become the choice of the oligarchs, the MIC, the bankers, the media, the people who actually run the country. She will serve them well. She knows her way around the system -- she's been gaming it most of her adult life -- and has all the right connections. Which is why even many prominent Republicans have joined the feeding frenzy and flocked to her like vultures over fresh kill. \nHillary will continue her faux-populist bloviating to keep the stinky masses in line, while her closest allies, the rich and powerful, continue to loot the Treasury, hollow out what's left of the U.S. economy, and bankrupt the middle and lower classes. \nMuch to the delight of the neocon-infested Department of State, Department of Defense, security agencies, MIC, and media, Hillary will \"get tough\" with Russia and China, press the war on Syria and the rest of the Middle East , promote and spread more chaos, death, and destruction across the globe in pursuit of military conquest, ultimately world empire. It'll be good for business and pumping up the already inflated egos of the exceptionalists. \nOn the other hand, Trump will fall flat on his face. His trademark bull-in-a-china-shop approach to making deals has no chance of success in Washington DC. He has no support -- his own party has all but disowned him -- no connections, at least not the political ones necessary for promoting his agenda. Yes, the politicos drank his champagne and ate the food at his extravagant bashes. Who wouldn't? But they don't owe him anything. Nada! Trump's much heralded talents for making great deals will confront hostile Democrats, contemptuous Republicans -- a perhaps long-overdue bipartisanship -- closing ranks to isolate and defeat the outrageous and vulgar outsider who thought he could buy and muscle his way into political power.

That will be sabotaged with a false flag attack, maybe dressing some disgruntled maquiladora workers as Russian infantry men and mounting an invasion on the U.S. -- probably in Calexico -- or by John McCain threatening to fall on a grenade or blow his brains out in the Senate chambers if America doesn't immediately nuke Moscow . \nDespite his self-proclaimed success in the business world, Trump simply does not know the rules of the game in Washington DC. Unless he \"fires\" everyone -- declaring martial law and sending all members of the legislature to a FEMA labor camp in Montana -- he will either be the most ineffective president in history or be impeached. Maybe both! \nIn a phrase, Donald Trump as president will do 'less damage'. \nAnyone who has read my recent writings knows that my greatest concern about a Hillary Clinton presidency is her truculent foreign policy . A decade ago, I might have believed that she was misguided. Now I realize -- as quite a number of others do -- that she is completely insane. She's become drunk on power, poisoned by surrounding herself with neocons and warmongering humanitarians , possessed by visions of herself as the Warrior Queen.",
