Since March of 2010, the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Act‚ÄîObamacare. This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don‚Äôt work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. 
Congress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must: 
1. Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. 
2. Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. 
3. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn‚Äôt Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.

On October 20, the Sun Sentinal reported that former Oakland Park Commissioner Anne Sallee noticed something troubling about her vote-by-mail ballot. It is missing Constitutional Amendment 2, the medical marijuana question. 
Sallee, now Broward chapter director of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, knows her way around government. Yet she said she spent a week unsuccessfully trying to get someone at the Broward elections office to pay attention to her complaint. 
She was cleared on Wednesday of another election snafu, the early posting of primary election results. Her office also was criticized for sending out inaccurate voter ID cards, and for printing ballots for November that include the word ‚Äúno‚Ä?in the ‚Äúyes‚Ä?line on the county‚Äôs transportation sales surtax question.

MATH SHOWS Trump Would Have Beaten Obama In Romney-Obama Election ¬ª 100percentfedUp.com,"Email For Republican politicians like Ohio Governor John Kasich who refused to get behind Donald J. Trump‚Ä¶it turns out Trump was right‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt need you. In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the ‚Äònever Trumpers‚Ä?from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten him‚Ä?
It‚Äôs easy to glance at Tuesday‚Äôs popular vote ‚Ä?which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 ‚Ä?and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obama‚Äôs 2012 totals in several Midwestern states ‚Ä?Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin ‚Ä?Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What‚Äôs more, she far surpassed Obama‚Äôs 2012 vote total in Florida, the country‚Äôs biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. 
A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the country‚Äôs most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation‚Äôs most critical battleground states. Let‚Äôs look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren‚Äôt yet final because not all precincts have reported.

He and his family have already sacrificed so much because he chose to put his country first. Making sacrifices is certainly not something loudmouth liberals like Robert DeNiro are accustomed to. DeNiro was very vocal about his opposition to the wildly successful business man Donald J. Trump. He felt so strongly about his hate for Trump that made a video where he angrily stated he‚Äôd like to, ‚Äúpunch him in the face.‚Ä?Now that Trump won the election in a landslide, DeNiro has chosen to get behind the Trump rioters who are terrorizing cities across America. Anti-Trump rioters are breaking windows, using baseball bats to smash the windshields of innocent citizens who get trapped in their hellish protests as they try to escape. Women who are taking part in the protests are being punched in the faces by men who are also taking part in the George Soros funded protests. American flags are being burned and families who are walking in major cities are being subjected to the most vile and disgusting, hateful language and images imaginable. If this is the kind of America that Robert DiNero is openly supporting? And if so, why would any American pay to see his movie,‚ÄùComedian‚Ä? 
Robert De Niro gave anti-Donald Trump protesters across the United States his backing Friday as he spoke about how ‚Äúdepressed‚Ä?the tycoon‚Äôs win in the presidential election had made him. 
The 73-year-old star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film ‚ÄúThe Comedian‚Ä?in Los Angeles when he was asked how he was coping with Trump‚Äôs victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
‚ÄúHow am I doing? I‚Äôm very depressed,‚Ä?the famously laconic ‚ÄúRaging Bull‚Ä?actor told reporters. 
‚ÄúWe have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government.‚Ä?
Asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of Tuesday‚Äôs election, he replied: ‚ÄúYes, absolutely. Things aren‚Äôt being done right.‚Ä?
Demonstrators took to the streets in Miami, Los Angeles, New York and other US cities for a third straight night on Friday. 
In Manhattan, they held signs reading ‚ÄúYour Wall Can‚Äôt Stand in Our Way‚Ä?‚Ä?a reference to the anti-immigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the US border with Mexico. 
De Niro hasn‚Äôt minced his words in his criticism of Trump, describing him as ‚Äúa punk,‚Ä?‚Äúa pig‚Ä?and ‚Äúan idiot.‚Ä?
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to punch him in the face,‚Ä?he said before the election. 
Earlier in the day a town in southern Italy where De Niro‚Äôs grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape. 
‚ÄúIf, after the disappointment of Trump, he wants to take refuge here, we are ready to welcome him,‚Ä?said Antonio Cerio, the mayor of Ferrazzano.

Political activist and Hillary supporter Amal Clooney traveled to Texas to warn Americans about our elected President Donald J. Trump and his tough immigration policies. Maybe she didn‚Äôt get the memo‚Ä¶Trump‚Äôs tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of GOP primary contenders. It wasn‚Äôt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence, ‚ÄúThere will never be a President Trump‚Ä? 
Perhaps Amal should‚Äôve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation. Aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of American ranchers, and threatened the safety and security of American citizens living in homes in or near the US -Mexican border towns‚Ä?
Amal Clooney has warned that many of president-elect Trump‚Äôs proposals would be ‚Äòviolations of international law.‚Ä?
Speaking at the Texas Conference For Women at the Austin Convention Center on Tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of George Clooney, said she had concerns about America‚Äôs reputation under the real estate mogul‚Äôs plans. 
She noted that Trump‚Äôs comments during his campaign, ‚Äòthat there should be a religious test imposed on entering the U.S. or the fact that there should be state-sponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed ‚Ä?all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that.‚Ä?
The 38-year-old wife said America‚Äôs reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. 
‚ÄòI think there‚Äôs some concern from abroad as to, ‚ÄúAre these things actually going to happen?‚Ä? or is the U.S. going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally,‚Ä?according to the Hollywood Reporter. 
Perhaps its time to put our nation‚Äôs security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us‚Ä?
Both Amal and her Hollywood actor husband George, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, have spoken out against Trump in the past. 
Earlier this year, Amal Clooney called for Trump to be challenged on his extreme views. 
Watch George Clooney here whine about press giving Trump too much favorable press: 
‚ÄòWhen you listen to what the leading candidate on the Republican side has been saying about building walls, about excluding Mexicans and a complete shutdown of all Muslims entering in, and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying, ‚ÄòThey only want jihad.

21st Century Wire says‚Ä?
Over the past months, Hillary Clinton, the Obama White House and the mainstream media have been promoting the conspiracy theory that ‚Ä?Russia is Hacking the US Election ‚Äù‚Ä?blaming Moscow for the WikiLeaks emails, the DNC Leaks and for allegedly ‚Äòhacking‚Ä?US voting systems. Despite the grand accusations, no evidence or proof has been offered by the US government. 
It goes without saying how damaging the Democratic Party‚Äôs crazed witch hunt has been to US-Russian relations, where Clinton has led the anti-Russian crusade, and demonizing president Vladimir Putin at every opportunity. 
Today‚Äôs stunning presidential victory by Donald Trump means that all eyes are now on Putin to see how Moscow and Washington will be interfacing going forward. 
With such sensitive geopolitical issues like Syria and the Ukraine currently in play, what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward‚Ä?
In a message to Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each other‚Äôs views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US. 
Putin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing Russian-American relations out of their current crisis. 
The Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some ‚Äúburning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,‚Ä?RIA Novosti reported. 
On top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that ‚Äúbuilding a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other‚Äôs positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.‚Ä?
According to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russia‚Äôs relations with the US ‚Äúwas not our choice,‚Ä?however. 
For things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russia‚Äôs interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month. 
‚ÄúWe are concerned with the deterioration of Russian-American relations, but that was not our choice, we never wanted that. On the contrary, we want to have friendly relations with the US, a great country and a leading economy,‚Ä?Putin said at an economic forum in Moscow‚Ä?

Mexico‚Äôs billionaire tycoon Carlos Slim saw a large chuck of his wealth evaporate ‚Ä?literally overnight, after news of a Donald Trump election victory hit the currency and stock markets on Wednesday morning. 
According to Bloomberg financial analysts, Slim, Mexico‚Äôs wealthiest person and rated fifth on the global rich list, took a stinging $5.1 billion haircut after the Mexican Peso went into a 12% free fall after Trump‚Äôs stunning upset over Democratic Hillary Clinton. 
Slim‚Äôs loss amounted to a staggering 9.2 percent of his total fortune. 
In the week before, polls showed Hillary Clinton as the odds on favorite, netting the billionaires a staggering $57 billion in total wealth increase across world markets.

You can imagine how nations like China and Russia are now laughing at US students as mass psychological trauma has apparently set-in across liberal America. Schools, universities and political institutions across the country are now offering various services following Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs insurgent victory in the US presidential election. 
According to NBC News , Democratic staffers were so distraught over this week‚Äôs election that ‚Äútherapy dogs‚Ä?had to be brought in to help workers on Capitol Hill cope with their vulnerabilities and hurt feelings.

Therapy Dogs included two golden doodles, two American Eskimo dogs, and a beagle mix ‚Ä?walked around the offices of the House of Representatives. Students at Cornell University even staged a ‚Äúcry-in‚Ä?on campus the day after the election. 
Other US campuses were organizing various theraputic activities like poetry readings, where ‚Äúhealthy snacks will be served.‚Ä?
The dogs were organized by NGOs the Human Animal Bond Research Initiative, Pet Partners, the Pet Leadership Council and the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council. 
Their press release says that Democratic Party staffers needed, ‚Äúthe help of a non-judgmental, furry, four-legged best friend that enjoys bipartisan support.‚Ä?
‚ÄúOrganizers say it was a great way for workers to blow off steam especially for those whose bosses may have lost re-election bids,‚Ä?NBC added.

J.R. Smith 21st Century Wire 
The election campaign might be over, but the mainstream media‚Äôs campaign against President Elect Donald Trump is in full swing. 
Between all of the fake polling, intentionally pro-Clinton partisan coverage, and mainstream media collusion with the Democratic National Party and the Clinton Campaign exposed through WikiLeaks‚Ä?Podesta email dump ‚Ä?nearly the entire US mainstream media is now in full damage-limitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left. 
It‚Äôs now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts, as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence, while promoting unfounded fears ‚Ä?and all the while pushing fictional ‚Äòhate crime‚Ä?hoaxes. 
CBS News flagship investigative program 60 Minutes conducted a recorded interview with Trump on Friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to ‚ÄúStop it,‚Ä?in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public, or at schools. In light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked America since the election results were announced last week, it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by Trump, but instead mainstream CBS buried it for 3 days until 60 Minutes was scheduled to air later on Sunday evening nationwide. If CBS had any credibility remaining, this certainly will have finished it off. 
When told about alleged reports of a ‚ÄòTrump supporter‚Ä?who were said to have been harassing Latinos and Muslims following his presidential win, Trump told interviewer Leslie Stahl , ‚ÄúI am so saddened to hear that.‚Ä?He then added, ‚ÄúAnd I say, ‚ÄòStop it.‚Ä?If it helps, I will say this ‚Ä?and I will say right to the cameras: ‚ÄòStop it.'‚Ä?
One big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did Stahl give any specifics on these alleged ‚Äúabuses‚Ä?by Trump supporters against Muslims and Latinos, and even though it‚Äôs obvious that Trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses ‚Ä?Stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf ‚Ä?without offering any evidence to support her claim. This was ‚Äòdrive-by‚Ä?media at its worst. In fact, not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media, and some may end up actually being media-generated rumors, or even hoaxes. 
Now, it‚Äôs perfectly understandable that Trump‚Äôs victory over the establishment‚Äôs heavily inflated candidate Hillary Clinton has left many Democrats, especially millennial college-aged students upset, angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos (they are not upset that Trump won, as much as they are upset that ‚Äòthey‚Ä?lost). The real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of America‚Äôs politically correct-obsessed young adults. The real danger is that Democratic Party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging, and fabricating ‚Äúhate crime‚Ä?incidents in order to propagate the idea that the President Elect and his supporters are somehow ‚Äúcausing many minorities fearful about the future‚Ä? In reality, much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets. 
In fact, one Muslim female from Louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged ‚Äòhate crime‚Ä?incident ‚Ä?one designed to discredit Trump, and to help stoke more nationwide protests. 
Buzzfeed reported, via Religion of Peace : 
A woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, including one wearing a Donald Trump hat, made up the story, police said in a statement. 
The woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab, a scarf sometimes worn by Muslim women, The Advertiser reported. 
Lafayette Police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation, the paper reported. 
‚ÄúDuring the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males,‚Ä?the statement reportedly read. 
NOTE: This story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of self-described ‚Äújournalists‚Ä?who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of America‚Äôs corrupt liberal mainstream media. 
That‚Äôs right ‚Ä?this was just another hoax: 
Violent Democratic-Affiliated Street Gangs 
What Leslie Stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at CBS and 60 Minutes have obscured is the fact since Tuesday‚Äôs election, nearly all of the so-called ‚Äòviolent hate crimes‚Ä?have been carried out against Trump supporters ‚Ä?by street gangs who are most clearly Democrat Party supporters. 
Here are just a few examples: @michellemalkin Even high school kids are not spared. Student Trump supporter attacked at Woodside High School https://t.co/e7tVvDJ6O8

Watch this clip taken from the radical leftist Portland protests this weekend, where Democratic Party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a ‚ÄòTrump supporter.‚Ä?These violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the Democratic Party and the sitting President of the United States, Barack Obama ‚Ä?are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the Democratic Party‚Äôs online ‚Äòcommunity organizer‚Ä?network MoveOn.org ‚Ä?a digital platform partly funded by leading Clinton donor and billionaire George Soros . Watch this stunning clip: 
. Here is a video of clip of a white male in Chicago, 49 yr old David Wilcox, who was driving and scraped another vehicle. When the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information, Wilcox was greeted by a gang of African-Americans, presumably Democratic Party supporters, who began pointing and shouting, ‚ÄúYou voted for Donald Trump!‚Ä?before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street. Wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight. He was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital. 
From reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did Wilcox display any support for Donald Trump. It appears as if they attacked him because he was white. So could one call this a case of black on white racism? Regardless, it‚Äôs political intimidation done on the street ‚Ä?which could also be defined as pure political fascism. In this instance, the violence was partisan, and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial Democrat foot soldiers ‚Ä?enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of America. Watch this disturbing video: . Agitator and Chief: Where is Obama? 
These incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national US media who are obviously still working to discredit the Trump Presidency. 
Amidst all this violence, however, where is the current President Obama, or the Democratic Party‚Äôs losing candidate Hillary Clinton ‚Ä?to help calm street thugs and violent ‚Äòprogressives‚Ä? It‚Äôs almost as if Obama and Clinton are enjoying the unrest. Most certainly though, Obama, Clinton and the Democratic Party are hoping to use this week‚Äôs media-generated liberal angst as future political leverage. 
What used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program, 60 minutes, has gradually become a joke. It seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest, opting instead for running bland People Magazine and Time Magazine-style ‚Äòsafe‚Ä?segments. Judging by its plummeting ratings, and its predictable cast of ‚Äòjob for life‚Ä?government-approved media gatekeeper-cum-commentators like Anderson Cooper and Lesley Stahl, there is little hope for this institution. You might even say it‚Äôs irredeemable . 
One of the corporate mainstream‚Äôs worst offenders during the election was CNN host Brian Stelter (photo, left), whose own show is ironically titled ‚ÄúReliable Sources.‚Ä?Stelter is meant to be CNN‚Äôs media watchdog person, laughably given the lofty title as ‚Äúsenior media analyst.‚Ä?After leading CNN‚Äôs own exposed efforts to obscure and derail Trump‚Äôs Presidential run, while working to cover for a hugely unpopular (even among Democrats) Hillary Clinton candidacy, Stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his network‚Äôs horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of US elections. But it‚Äôs too late. The damage has already been done, and CNN will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain. They are a dirty media outlet, and now everyone knows it. 
Now CBS News has been exposed in public view, but their crime is even worse than CNN‚Äôs which was just dirty politics in comparison. CBS News took it upon itself to compromise public safety, and put lives at risk ‚Ä?all for its own selfish institutional political position. Twenty years ago, this might have been considered shameful, but in today‚Äôs toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses ‚Ä?they are all way past shameless at this stage. 
None of them can be trusted anymore ‚Ä?only tolerated, in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years.

William McGurn Wall Street Journal 
Let‚Äôs get this straight. Calling Hillary Clinton a ‚Äúbigot‚Ä?has reporters asking every Republican in sight if Donald Trump has gone too far. But the Clinton campaign releases a video saying Mr. Trump is the candidate of the Ku Klux Klan, and it‚Äôs all okey-dokey? 
Then again, Mr. Trump has already been likened to Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. Small wonder there‚Äôs a collective ho-hum when Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says Mr. Trump is peddling ‚ÄúKKK values.‚Ä?
This is what Democrats do. It didn‚Äôt start with Mr. Trump, either. For years Democrats have portrayed the GOP as one giant hate group. 
Each presidential election, the drill goes like this: 
After Republicans nominate someone, he immediately finds himself having to prove he‚Äôs not a hater ‚Ä?of African-Americans, of women, of gays, etc. 
This year Democrats added a twist. Mr. Trump, they claim, represents a break with all those decent and lovable Republicans such as Mitt Romney , John McCain and George W. Bush . Of course, this isn‚Äôt what they were saying back when these men were running for president. 
‚Ä?In 2000, for example, an NAACP ad recreated the gruesome murder of James Byrd to imply that then-Gov. Bush was sympathetic to lynching black men. Over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck, Mr. Byrd‚Äôs daughter says, ‚ÄúSo when Gov. George W. Bush refused to support hate-crimes legislation, it was like my father was killed all over again.‚Ä?
‚Ä?When John McCain ran in 2008, Barack Obama warned that Republicans would scare people by saying, ‚ÄúYou know, he doesn‚Äôt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.‚Ä?The McCain campaign fired back, accusing Mr. Obama of playing the race card from the ‚Äúbottom of the deck.‚Ä?Funny thing: All those reporters always hearing ‚Äúdog whistles‚Ä?from Republicans somehow didn‚Äôt hear this one. 
‚Ä?In 2012, when Mitt Romney went to the NAACP and told them face-to-face about his opposition to ObamaCare, the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote. Vice President Joe Biden put it more explicitly, telling a largely African-American audience that if Mr. Romney were to win, he‚Äôd ‚Äúput ya‚Äôll back in chains.‚Ä?

(AP Photo / Dennis System) 
COLUMBUS, OH (AP) ‚Ä?History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November. 
The organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee. 
The Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they don‚Äôt vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process. 
‚ÄúOver the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,‚Ä?said AAB chairman Menno Simons. ‚ÄúWe have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage. Now, they want to put a woman in the nation‚Äôs highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 Timothy 2:12. We need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lord‚Äôs way.‚Ä?
According to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote. 
‚ÄúThe Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,‚Ä?Silver noted. ‚ÄúThey also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.‚Ä?
The Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,‚Ä?Clinton wrote to the AAB. ‚ÄúAs a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.‚Ä?
Most pundits believe that Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs plea is too little too late. 
During a press conference in Manhattan, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because ‚Äúthe Amish do great work for a very low price.‚Ä?
Though Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff over the next two weeks. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses. 
‚ÄúIt looked like she was going to win this election easily,‚Ä?said Paul Horner, a campaign worker in Ohio, ‚ÄúBut this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Cleary, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. It‚Äôs really sad to see the campaign end this way.‚Ä?

Mike Pence (R), who has pushed the ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Ä?conspiracy on the campaign trail alongside Donald Trump. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen nothing but partisan activity from the secretary of state, and even from the police,‚Ä?Buck said. ‚ÄúThey saw that there was a very successful voter registration drive happening, and this was an attempt to shut it down.‚Ä?‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that the governor or the governor‚Äôs staff are very aware and involved in what‚Äôs happening,‚Ä?he continued. ‚ÄúIt fits into the Trump/Pence narrative that in certain neighborhoods, you have to watch how many times people show up to vote and how things happen.‚Ä?If this situation is Not fully clarified in the following hours we could see in the General election how Trump will probably take Indiana with a really small margin of votes by blocking these voters to be able to express their decision freely. All this operation of today is part of carefully designed Republican strategy to use the excuse of a possible fraud to justify arbitrary measures that will prevent many Americans to elect the next President, is a political boycott of the General Election.

Basically, they have trouble thinking of how others perceive their actions. These people tend to be highly intelligent. Trump's IQ is 156, which makes sense considering he has built more businesses than most of us have, and although he could have invested his father's money and made the same amount back as he did in the end through business deals, he put a lot of work and thought into his business. I would like to know what kind of medicines Trump is on and what his mental health diagnosis are. If he has Aspergers, then that would explain why he makes so many social mistakes. Being super rich from a young age might also account for it since he would not be trained to interact with people on an equal level (which is a lot more complicated than interacting with people when you are rich and they are poor). However, an article in The New York Times recently focused on Trump's fears of making social blunders. He has a fear of losing social status or being embarrassed publicly. However, he doesn't seem to do well publicly, which must be a disability because he would *want* to be a good public speaker and not make social gaffes yet he still does it. It must be accidental. Donald even stated he is a difficult man to be married to, which means he knows himself and his weaknesses.

Trump promised something that NO DEMOCRAT has cared enough to attempt, in decades. Our next President proposed and detailed a critically important ""NEW DEAL FOR BLACK AMERICA"". Story: www.nbcnews.com... It's a damn shame that Barack Hussein Obama completely ignored the/his Black community after receiving their votes. Now, Hillary Clinton is following in his footsteps.. She's blindly assuming that because she's a Democrat, and was endorsed by Barack Obama, the African American community will ""fall in line"" like good little mindless minions, and cast their 16 million votes for her, like they did for Obama in 2012. This cycle, open-minded Black Americans who refuse to be FOOLED AGAIN, are indeed going to give Donald Trump a try. As you can see from this video of boxing promoter DON KING introducing Donald Trump to a church filled with Black ministers and community leaders in Ohio last month, important segments of the community are tired of being lied to, screwed by, and ignored by, DEMOCRATS that they voted for! Don King Introduces Donald Trump (C-Span Video): www.youtube.com... For obvious reasons, the ""old guard"" community leaders like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, along with the NAACP, are not in Donald Trump's corner. But what's most telling, is that they are not out there at rallies raising Hillary's arm to roaring crowds of supporters either. Probably because they know Hillary is lying when she exclaims, ""I ain't in no ways ever tired of fightin for youuu!"" in Black churches. In 30 years, she's done NOTHING for no one except herself, Chelsea, and Saudi Arabian women abusers. -CareWeMust",english,2016-10-27T09:42:42.294+03:00,abovetopsecret.com,US,18533,DONALD J.

Conservatives claim that voter ID is necessary to catch illegal voters, but it turns out they‚Äôre the only ones creating fake IDs to use on Election Day. 
Trump supporters are taking Trump‚Äôs call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake ID badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them, confusing them, and filming them ‚Ä?all of which are illegal. 
But, Trump‚Äôs deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a right-wing group known as ‚ÄúVote Protectors.‚Ä?
The group, which is affiliated with top Trump ally Roger Stone, is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on Election Day. They are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes. 
According to the Huffington Post , 
Stone‚Äôs group created an official-looking ID badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake ‚Äúexit polls,‚Ä?efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. Or at least that‚Äôs what the group was planning to do before The Huffington Post asked Stone about it on Tuesday. The controversial Trump ally, long known for his bare-knuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his group‚Äôs websites were there without his knowledge, and assured HuffPost that he would operate within the confines of election law. 
In fact, after HuffPo confronted Stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that Vote Protectors had a ‚Äúbad idea‚Ä?and ‚Äúordered them taken down.‚Ä?
Campaign Legal Center deputy director Danielle Lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy,‚Ä?she told HuffPo in reference to the videotaping. ‚ÄúWhen that‚Äôs being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. Objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it.‚Ä?
Indeed, but that‚Äôs exactly what Donald Trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him. 
As it turns out, he‚Äôs right about the election being rigged, only it‚Äôs conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of Trump. 
Earlier this week, a Wisconsin city clerk in Green Bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she has merely heard that students lean Democrat. 
‚ÄúI was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,‚Ä?Republican appointed clerk Kris Teske wrote. 
‚ÄúUWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn‚Äôt going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats.‚Ä?
So not only are Trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well. 
And that is likely going to cause a lot of Election Day chaos. Voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what Trump‚Äôs deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it.

One thing that has continuously dogged the Donald Trump for president campaign is the fact that racists, anti-semites, xenophobes, misogynists, and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign. No matter how much Trump‚Äôs people try to say he doesn‚Äôt want the support of such folks, the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously. So, naturally, when Trump‚Äôs campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sat down with an interview with CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper on Sunday , that particular issue came up again. Of course, Conway was not happy. Tapper began: 
‚ÄúThere are a lot of anti-Semites and racists and misogynists who support the Trump candidacy.‚Ä?
Conway immediately went on defense, saying, ‚Äúwow.‚Ä?Tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting ‚ÄòJEW-S-A‚Ä?at the press pen at a recent Trump rally, and directly asked Conway if she would refer to such people as ‚Äòdeplorable.‚Ä?She responded: 
‚ÄúYes, I would. Wow, I have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe ‚Ä?I hope you‚Äôve been to Trump rallies and I hope that you‚Äôve seen the tens of thousands. I mean, he‚Äôs had over half a million people easily, I think in excess of that. These are U.S.A.-loving Americans.‚Ä?
Tapper went on to say that no, he isn‚Äôt putting all Trump supporters into that camp, but went on to force Conway‚Äôs hand on this one: 
‚ÄúBut without question, people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic and racists and on and on. And these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting Mr. Trump. 
Mr. Trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and anti-Semitic fans,‚Ä?Tapper continued. ‚ÄúHe just has. He says things like, ‚ÄúOh, sure, I disavow, I disavow.‚Ä?But he has never serious said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want the support of those people, they are reprehensible, they have nothing to do with me.‚Ä?He has never seriously done it.‚Ä?
Conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the Trump campaign is winning, saying: 
‚ÄúI think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence I have that we‚Äôre actually going to win in nine days because the idea that we‚Äôre going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that Hillary Clinton would bring to the Oval Office in such an important week.‚Ä?
No, Kellyanne, it‚Äôs not a sign that Trump is winning. It‚Äôs pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began: That Donald Trump is a raging bigot, and he has been so openly. Dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle, and it‚Äôs all because of Donald Trump. He embraces these bigots because he‚Äôs one of them. The quicker you learn that, the better.

Donald Trump‚Äôs deplorable supporters aren‚Äôt waiting for the election results to start spilling blood. 
They‚Äôve been threatening bloody violence ever since Trump began claiming that the election is ‚Äúrigged‚Ä?in favor of Hillary Clinton. And Trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places. 
In Texas last week, a Trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of Trump‚Äôs stupid hats and a ‚ÄúDeplorables‚Ä?T-shirt to vote. 
Election code prohibits any person from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. 
Of course, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules don‚Äôt apply to them. 
Well, now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped Trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down. 
At Collin College in Plano, Texas a Trump sign was discovered zip-tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places. 
But when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside. The blades sliced into the volunteer‚Äôs hands and drew blood, requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal. 
‚ÄúIt just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody who‚Äôs probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other,‚Ä?local Democratic Party campaign chair Steve Spainhouer said in response . ‚ÄúI think most people have already made their minds up at this point how they‚Äôre going to vote and so there‚Äôs nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful.‚Ä?
Here‚Äôs the video via KTVT . 
Frankly, this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism. Trump‚Äôs supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as Election Day approaches. And if Trump loses, his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup. 
Clearly, these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger. But you won‚Äôt hear Donald Trump condemning this act of violence. After all, he is the one inciting it.

New video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, Fred Trump, young Donald Trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants. 
As part of an investigation by NBC News, Stanley Leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the Trump Organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder Trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties. 
In the interview, Leibowitz said that Trump told him ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt rent to the n-word,‚Ä?and indicates that Trump made this statement with Donald Trump in the room and that the younger Trump affirmed the policy. 
The revelation comes at the same time that the Clinton campaign has released a video highlighting Trump‚Äôs run-in with the federal government over discrimination. 
Undercover investigators were sent to Trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties. 
One bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a ‚ÄúC‚Ä?on the documents for ‚Äúcolored,‚Ä?and that was a sign that they should be denied. 
The Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs involvement with his father‚Äôs business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his father‚Äôs $14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business. But if you accept that, the Trump Organization‚Äôs history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away ‚Ä?it‚Äôs still there.

We‚Äôve all seen pictures of the Trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor, complete with their young son Barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents. It‚Äôs a life most of us can never imagine while we‚Äôre paying our monthly bills. So what‚Äôs it like growing up with Donald Trump as a father? According to Scott Melker, a former classmate of Donald Trump Jr.‚Äôs, at the University of Pennsylvania, being the former reality show star‚Äôs son wasn‚Äôt what one might imagine. Or, given Trump‚Äôs temperament, it might be exactly what you‚Äôd imagine. 
On Facebook , Mekler told of the animosity Trump‚Äôs son had for this father. 
‚ÄúI was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends, next door to Donald Jr.‚Äôs room. I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his son‚Äôs door, there to pick him up for a baseball game,‚Ä?he recalls. ‚ÄúThere were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey.‚Ä?
Then Mekler told of the moment Trump slapped his son in the face in front of others. 
‚ÄúWithout saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said ‚Äúput on a suit and meet me outside,‚Ä?and closed the door,‚Ä?Melker wrote. 
‚ÄúDonald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking,‚Ä?he continued. ‚ÄúHe absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. His nickname was ‚ÄúDiaper Don,‚Ä?because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other people‚Äôs beds and urinate.‚Ä?‚ÄúI always felt terrible for him,‚Ä?he continued. 
Mekler said part of his reason for voting for Hillary Clinton is because ‚Äúin light of what I saw that day, it is clear to me that Donald Trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country.‚Ä?
To be clear, we are not demonizing Trump‚Äôs son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days. Whether Melker‚Äôs story is accurate or not, we‚Äôre not sure, but given Trump‚Äôs awful temper, it‚Äôs difficult to discount it.

GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has taken a ridiculously hardline ‚Ä?and even bigoted ‚Ä?stance on immigration. He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect ‚Äúdeportation forces‚Ä?to root out and get rid of all people in the United States without proper documentation. Well, as we already knew, it turns out that The Donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one. 
According to the Associated Press , it turns out that Donald Trump‚Äôs wife Melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the United States when she first arrived from her native Slovenia. Melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitor‚Äôs visa, known as a B1/B2 visa. This occurred on August 27, 1996. Melania did not get a legal work visa until October 18, 1996. During the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, Melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of $20,000. She got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006. 
So, in other words, Melania Trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as Thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. Melania said, in part, in her stump speech: 
‚ÄúAs a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here. Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American.‚Ä?
Well, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that Melania Trump wasn‚Äôt as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. The information obtained by the AP include, but are not limited to, her contract from Metropolitan International Management ‚Ä?a modeling agency. Also, there‚Äôs the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows Melania working during the time when she had the visitor‚Äôs visa, but no work visa. It seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up Melania‚Äôs wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. This would be why Melania Trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the United States and her eventual path to citizenship. While it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. You can read more here at the Associated Press . 
The long and short of it is this: Donald Trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the ‚Äúother.‚Ä?Namely, immigrants. That is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didn‚Äôt completely comply with immigration law. Hopefully this story, and the many other lies and cover-ups and shady dealings surrounding the Trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time.

If you had wanted to give Trump supporters the benefit of the doubt, this most recent incident proves that it‚Äôs far too much to give them. 
A 56-year-old man in Allen Park, Michigan has just been charged with six felonies after he held six children at gunpoint because he thought they‚Äôd damaged the Donald Trump sign on his lawn. Yes, this is the kind of deranged, emotionally unstable supporters Trump has attracted. 
The man, Michael Robert Kubek, had called police on October 29th to report that his Trump sign had been hit by teenagers, who had fled the scene. When the police arrived at the scene, they didn‚Äôt find Kubek at his home ‚Ä?however, when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner, there he was. 
The police saw Kubek standing over six children ages 12-14, who were sitting on the grass. Kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it. The children denied any involvement, and the officers told Kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children. 
According to the kids, they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when Kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them, instructing them to sit down on the grass. Those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock: Twitter Twitter 
The News-Herald reported: 
‚ÄúThe officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign, but Kubek repeated that he could not. The officer then asked Kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids. According to police, Kubek said ‚Äúyes.‚Ä?
In response to another question from the officer, Kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered.‚Ä?
Yes, a grown man used a gun because he felt ‚Äúoutnumbered‚Ä?by a small group of innocent kids. This is EXACTLY the type of unhinged person who shouldn‚Äôt be trusted with firearms! Kubek‚Äôs hearing is scheduled for December 5th ‚Ä?let‚Äôs hope that whatever happens to Kubek, that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner. You can watch a report below:

Trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isn‚Äôt hard. Getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that Trump is the liar of liars is. Same thing with bullying, but The New York Times put together a spread of all the bullyish things Trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. Now, the Toronto Star ‚Äòs Daniel Dale has been tracking Trump‚Äôs lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here . 
There are literally hundreds of lies in Trump‚Äôs speeches. They‚Äôre not all 100% unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that Trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy. 
Is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? Tons of people claim Hillary is a master liar, but first, she‚Äôs actually more honest than most politicians. Second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with Trump the Liar in any way, shape or form. 
The Star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories: Clinton‚Äôs policies, WTF, Daesh/Middle East, Clinton‚Äôs record, African Americans/Inner cities, The Clintons‚Ä?corruption, Rigged election, Trade/Economy, Health care, Trump‚Äôs endorsements, Refugees/Immigration, Polls, Obama‚Äôs record, The campaign, Russia, Trump‚Äôs record, Taxes, Sex assault allegations, Clinton‚Äôs health and Government corruption. 
They also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies Trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with, ‚ÄúThe electoral system is rigged.‚Ä?Of course, it‚Äôs rigged against him: 
‚ÄúAfter plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, Trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election. ‚ÄòRigged‚Ä?became his catchword. 
He claimed Hillary Clinton campaign workers hired ‚Äòthugs‚Ä?to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage Clinton. He claimed there was widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis ‚Ä?cities with large black populations that heavily favour Democrats. 
In Greeley, Colo., Trump told his supporters if they don‚Äôt trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. So, one did. Trump supporter Terri Lynn Rote, a 55-year-old from Iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice.‚Ä?
Nobody‚Äôs committing voter suppression and fraud quite like Trumpsters and Republicans. 
Another is, ‚ÄúMuslims are risky.‚Ä?This touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from Syria, who could be the great Trojan Horse of our time: 
‚ÄúHis claims that Syrian refugees ‚Ä?99 per cent are Muslim ‚Ä?are terrorists plays to the fears of the ‚Äúother,‚Ä?even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. And their numbers is nowhere near Trump‚Äôs claims ‚Ä?about 13,000 have been admitted to the United States in 2016.‚Ä?
‚ÄúThe polls favour Trump.‚Ä?Har de har har ‚Ä?Trump only looks at the polls he likes, and they‚Äôre usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. Very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. Nevertheless: 
‚ÄúIt seems clear Trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. This ‚Äòpoll denialism‚Ä?gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests CNN. 
His false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling ‚Ä?and perhaps even the vote itself. If supporters feel Trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible. 
On Oct. 24, he said ‚ÄòI won the last two debates, and every poll showed it.‚Ä?In fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost. 
Of course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, Trump was quick to promote ‚Ä?and exaggerate ‚Ä?those numbers.‚Ä?
But these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. He has also: Falsely said on Twitter, ‚ÄúThe failing NYTimes reporters don‚Äôt even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way!‚Ä?Falsely said, ‚ÄúBy ‚Äòopen borders,‚Ä?[Hillary] means totally unlimited immigration.‚Ä?Falsely said, ‚ÄúHillary‚Äôs plan includes an open border with the Middle East.‚Ä?Falsely called NBC anchor Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, ‚Äúa Democrat.‚Ä?Falsely said, ‚ÄúWow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible.‚Ä?Falsely said the U.S. provided Iran ‚Ä?150 billion‚Ä?as part of the nuclear deal. Falsely said, ‚ÄúIn San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people‚Ä¶Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.‚Ä?Falsely asserted that Clinton has ‚Äúbeen fighting ISIS (her) entire adult life.‚Ä?Falsely said, ‚ÄúAll together, the Hillary Clinton plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term.‚Ä?Falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring NATO ‚Äúobsolete because it doesn‚Äôt cover terror;‚Ä?falsely suggested NATO created an anti-terror position because of his comments. Falsely claimed Clinton didn‚Äôt release cholesterol or EKG information Falsely said sexual assault allegations against him ‚Äúhave been largely debunked.‚Ä?Falsely said, apparently of sexual assault accuser Summer Zervos, ‚ÄúThe one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense.‚Ä?Falsely said ‚ÄúI did not.

And so many more, just in the last six weeks! Yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. If Trump sees this, he‚Äôll likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the paper‚Äôs lying, and continue to sell the myth that he‚Äôs not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies.

As if the election of Donald Trump couldn‚Äôt get even more disastrous and hypocritical, Senator Lindsey Graham just called on Trump to nominate a right-wing extremist to nation‚Äôs highest court. 
All year long, Republicans have been blocking President Obama‚Äôs nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court because they want the next president to make the pick. And because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted, they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist. 
South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told WYFF-TV that Trump should pick Texas Senator Ted Cruz as the nominee and warned Democrats not to block him, which is hypocritical considering how Republicans have treated President Obama‚Äôs nominee and threatened to block any nominees Hillary Clinton would have made had she won the election. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to tell my Democratic colleagues that I voted for Obama‚Äôs nominees. I expect them to give Trump‚Äôs nominees a fair shake. He won this election. He will pick a conservative. I would put Ted Cruz on that list. If they try to block this pick, they will regret it. If you don‚Äôt honor Trump‚Äôs nominee, you‚Äôre making a huge mistake.‚Ä?
Democrats should stand up and give Graham a collective middle finger. 
Since Antonin Scalia died in February, there has been a vacancy on the Supreme Court bench that has yet to be filled. The body wasn‚Äôt even cold yet before Republicans vowed to block any nominee President Obama picked to replace him, going so far as to even deny Garland a confirmation hearing. That‚Äôs far from the ‚Äúfair shake‚Ä?Graham is asking Democrats to give to a man as dangerous as Ted Cruz. 
Putting Cruz on the Supreme Court would guarantee rulings against women‚Äôs rights and LGBT rights as well as putting laws like the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act in further peril. In no uncertain terms should Democrats grant Cruz a hearing, nor should they respect any of Trump‚Äôs conservative choices for the court. Republicans should have thought about ‚Äúfair shakes‚Ä?before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the Supreme Court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than Trump. Again, Senate Republicans didn‚Äôt even give Garland a hearing or a vote. They refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards President Obama. And so that‚Äôs exactly what Democrats should do to Trump. Turnabout is fair play and Republicans only have themselves to blame.

Post election, the media and Donald Trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. They are making the claim that Trump wasn‚Äôt elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that it‚Äôs simply not true. Trump voters are racist and there‚Äôs proof. 
The American National Elections Study (ANES) began the study in January. Initially, they asked ‚ÄúHow likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.‚Ä?Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. It‚Äôs VERY unlikely that whites aren‚Äôt getting jobs because minorities are, but that‚Äôs not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that it‚Äôs ‚Äúextremely likely‚Ä?that minorities are taking jobs from white people. Graph courtesy of ANES and Salon . 
Then, they asked the same Trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. Despite the fact that trade was one of Trump‚Äôs signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed. 
Post election, this is what the study found: 
The question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is ‚Äúextremely likely‚Ä?that whites can‚Äôt find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is ‚Äúnot at all‚Ä?likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eighty-one percent of white women who think it is ‚Äúextremely likely‚Ä?people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who don‚Äôt think that. 
More than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are ‚Äúviolent.‚Ä?84 percent think that of Muslims. 
Unfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this: 
Democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As I‚Äôve shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation. 
Great idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots‚Ä?claims go unchallenged.

Before the leaked tape of Donald Trump describing his propensity to grab women ‚Äúby the pussy‚Ä?to Billy Bush, it seemed that the media was ignoring Donald Trump‚Äôs glaring faults as a presidential candidate. During the primaries , for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. It turns out there might be a reason for that ‚Ä?Trump was bribing the media ‚Ä?at least that‚Äôs the accusation being made by Megyn Kelly of Fox News. 
In her memoire ‚ÄúSettle for More,‚Ä?which will be released this week, Kelly said that Trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women ‚Äúfat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.‚Ä?That question set Trump off on one of his Twitter tirades. These are only a portion: 
The worst and most controversial of which was this: 
As the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that Trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. If they didn‚Äôt, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery. 
While Kelly couldn‚Äôt speak for other members of the media, she alleges that Trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. While the attempt clearly didn‚Äôt work on Kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. 
‚ÄúThis is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign: I was not the only journalist to whom Trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage,‚Ä?Kelly said. He also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding, ‚ÄúThis is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking.‚Ä?
‚ÄúTrump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded,‚Ä?she said. 
When it became obvious that some reporters were ‚Äúin the tank‚Ä?for Trump, she alleges in one chapter, ‚Äúcertain TV hosts‚Ä?would work with the candidate in advance on occasional Trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. She didn‚Äôt identify them by name or media outlet. 
Source: Yahoo 
Kelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which Kelly asked about Trump‚Äôs treatment of women, the candidate called Fox News exec. Bill Sammon, who told him about the first question. All we heard about, though, during the election, was that it was Hillary Clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering. The insider knowledge said that a woman, in the Flint, Michigan debate, would ask a question about the Flint water . 
While bribing journalists isn‚Äôt illegal, per say, it is highly unethical. Without the Fourth Estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics, democracy is impossible.

In reaction to Donald Trump‚Äôs victory, The Simpsons decided to update their 2000 prediction of a Trump presidency.

Hopefully, the financial despair the fictional President Trump never becomes a reality, but seeing as he has no experience, is a businessman who‚Äôs not as good as he says he is, and The Simpsons have been right thus far, the future‚Äôs looking pretty bleak. 
Here‚Äôs the original clip of President Lisa Simpson calling out a Donald Trump presidency for his fiscal fallout and bad economy: 
Early on into Trump‚Äôs campaign, The Simpsons satirized the reality TV host turned president-elect by having Homer Simpson somehow at the campaign rollout and falling into Trump‚Äôs hair. If we could only go back to that moment and enjoy the comedy over reality. 
Now we have to reap what we‚Äôve sown, or rather what the less than half of voting Americans have sown considering Trump only won with the Electoral College and lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in his own words, big league. 
Most of us with The Simpsons were very wrong with the prediction as well.

It was just a few days ago that Bernie Sanders responded to Trump‚Äôs election win with the perfect message from Democrats. He said : 
‚ÄúIf Donald Trump takes people‚Äôs anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare.‚Ä?
And from what was just announced, it seems that Sanders has every intention of making good on that warning. Earlier today, the Vermont Senator was named chair of outreach during a closed-door Senate Democrat caucus meeting, according to The Hill . In his new role, Sanders will lead outreach to blue-collar voters ‚Ä?the very voters who became Trump supporters this year. Sanders will also be the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. Acknowledging that he has a ‚Äúheavy responsibility to help shape the priorities of the United States government,‚Ä?Sanders said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do everything that I can to make sure that the budget that leaves the United States Congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking middle class and not billionaires.‚Ä?With the announcement of Sanders‚Ä?new position, Trump is definitely going to be a nervous wreck. He‚Äôs spent his entire presidential campaign claiming that he would help the working class, and now Sanders is in the position to challenge him and hold him to it for the next four years. By elevating Sanders to this new role, Democrats are moving to a more grassroots message, fully aware that Sanders‚Ä?presidential campaign and vision for America resonated with many voters. As we saw with Sanders‚Ä?popularity in the primaries, the Vermont Senator struck a nerve with workers and families, making him the perfect candidate to go up against Trump as he takes office. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) commented on Sanders‚Ä?new responsibility: ‚ÄúWe want to expand on that, and he will be reaching out to all our allies. We have a tremendous amount of talent in our caucus and we want to make sure everyone is contributing.‚Ä?Sanders hardly needed this promotion to upset Trump, as he‚Äôs been one of the most outspoken politicians on Twitter since Trump‚Äôs win: Twitter Twitter Twitter 
However, Sanders‚Ä?new role is great news for our country, and we know he‚Äôs going to give Trump hell.

Donald Trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign, and he‚Äôs only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the President-elect. 
On Monday, Trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access. This meeting was particularly important because Trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected. 
Some reporters in attendance were NBC‚Äôs Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd; ABC‚Äôs James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz; CBS‚Ä?Norah O‚ÄôDonnell and Charlie Rose; Fox News‚Ä?Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott; MSNBC‚Äôs Phil Griffin; and CNN‚Äôs Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. It was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan. 
Unfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby Trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. Or, as one person put it , ‚ÄúIt was like a f*cking firing squad.‚Ä?
Trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. According to The New York Post , one anonymous source said: 
‚ÄúThe meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down.‚Ä?
This claim was backed up by another person, who said: 
‚ÄúThe meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. 
‚ÄúTrump kept saying, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars.‚Ä?
This attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, Trump barely let them speak. While this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of Trump. He has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings. 
Americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is: Twitter Twitter Twitter 
Interestingly enough, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. She said: 
‚ÄúExcellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. Pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.‚Ä?
Disgraceful.

Launched in 2012, Trump Tower is a joint venture between Century Properties and the Trump Organization. It will be managed by Century Properties Management Inc. To rise at 250 meters above ground, the 56-story building is designed by award-winning international architectural firm Broadway Malyan. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really just an iconic, modern building, very tall, very chic, something that really symbolizes everything that a Trump project means,‚Ä?said Eric Trump, son of Donald, and executive vice president of development and acquisition. 
It is located at the corner of Kalayaan Avenue and Salamanca Street in Makati City. 
But today, Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte issued an executive order canceling the building permit of the Trump Tower. 
Duterte called Donald Trump and his organization ‚Äúpersona non grata‚Ä?for the Republican presidential candidate‚Äôs recent comments about the Philippines. 
It will be recalled that in one of his campaign speeches, Trump lumped the Philippines with other countries with terrorism links, calling for the banning Filipinos from immigrating to the United States. Duterte even challenged Trump to a fist fight. 
‚ÄúIf we, Filipinos, are not welcome in the United States, why would we welcome Trump in the Philippines,‚Ä?Duterte said. 
Asked by The Adobo Chronicles what the Philippine government plans to do with the Trump Tower, Duterte replied, ‚ÄúI will make it a rehabilitation center for the more than half a million Filipino drug users who surrendered as part of my war on drugs.‚Ä?

A top aide to Hillary Clinton urged the FBI on Tuesday to disclose what it knows about any ties between Donald Trump and Russia, accusing the agency of unfairly publicizing its inquiry into Clinton's email practices while staying quiet about the Republican presidential candidate.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a preliminary inquiry in recent months into allegations that Trump or his associates might have had questionable dealings with Russian people or businesses, but found no evidence to warrant opening a full investigation, according to sources familiar with the matter. The agency has not publicly discussed the probe.
A week before Election Day, the Clinton campaign was trying to contain damage from the announcement by FBI Director James Comey on Friday that his agency was looking into newly discovered emails that might relate to Clinton's use of a private server while she was secretary of state.
Clinton has voiced confidence the FBI will not find anything problematic.
Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook questioned why the FBI director had not released any information about the agency's Russia inquiries.

The FBI inquiry reviewed allegations that Trump or his associates might have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or engaged in contacts or commerce with people in Russia who are subject to U.S. or international financial sanctions.
The U.S. government has blamed Russia for cyber attacks on Democratic Party organizations. Democrats criticize Trump for taking what they say is a pro-Russia foreign policy stance.
Russia's possible role in the campaign again came into focus when online magazine Slate said a group of computer scientists had been alarmed by records showing thousands of apparent connection attempts between an email server operated on behalf of the Trump Organization and computers inside a Russian company, Alfa Bank in Moscow.
Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the server, which had been used to send out hotel marketing material, had been dormant for years.
Prominent U.S. cyber security company FireEye said it had been hired by Alfa Bank to investigate the records and had been granted access to the bank‚Äôs systems in Moscow to look for evidence of any relationship with Trump‚Äôs company or any signs of hacking or infection.

""USA! USA! USA!"" they chanted together in the Hilton Ballroom as the results came in. Who needs polls? They never gave him a chance but now we have it: President Donald Trump. Not only were the polls spectacularly wrong (who will ever trust this particularly bankrupt form of moralising presumptive analysis and telling us how we do and should feel?) but also the pundits who were not just arrogant about the fact that Trump had no chance but also were hopelessly out of touch with what America was thinking across its societal spectrum, what it wanted, what was felt deep in its blood.
It is a rejection of the liberal consensus the entire West has wallowed in since the 90's and a rejection of Obama and the false hope he decried, the impotent nature of US political leverage around the world and the rejection of brazen corruption and questionable ethics as typified by ""Crooked Hillary"".
The world must live with it; democracy has spoken and they're going to have to get over the words President Trump. Some will head for the hills, some will run to Canada, others will continue to cry but as Obama said yesterday, regardless of the result ""tomorrow the sun will still shine.""
This is a cry for American exceptionalism and like him or not Trump typifies that. He is committed to education, and demands high performance. Selling well is an admirable skill for a President to have. Negotiating with Congress, internationally, etc., is exceptionally useful. Trump has taken beatings financially and come out smelling like a rose.
Trump's business experience involves negotiations with business leaders and even governments around the world, and he likely has connections behind the scenes that surpass those of simply purely political candidates -- this gives him keen, realistic insights into economics in different parts of the world, as well as additional avenues to pursue trade agreements, and even perhaps some nuanced insights of particular financial weaknesses of possible global competitors, not to mention experience and insight into the partnerships and/or antagonism between different industries and particular governments.

What Donald Trump is doing is representing the absolute heartbreak and anger and frustration at a government gone mad and it seems the Left completely underestimated that in their vitriol in crying #NeverTrump and portraying him as the devil incarnate.
Although it is entirely true that Trump is ostentatious and has his mistakes, he brings something to the Presidential table no other candidate had before; he speaks his mind.
America clearly is sick of weasel politicians who are too afraid to say what people want to hear, they want the facts straight.
President Trump isn't cut from the political class, that class which is entrenched in its self-interest and has let the country down time and time again. Ross Perot once said that we need somebody to clean out the stables, a corrupted, ethically questionable President is therefore not the answer in order to accomplish that and I'm not talking about Donald Trump.
Trump is a pragmatist in an era of rapidly approaching chaos, he is not a social engineer, a think tanker who wants to please those lining his bank accounts. The liberal Democratic policies of Obama, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Sen. Harry Reid and their company created a climate that has led to this decision today.
So what if his language is intemperate and insulting? Even lacking in nobility from time to time? How can a true changemaker be straitjacketed by politically correct chains if he or she must express the will of the people, uncomfortable concerns that lie dormant for far too long?
Obama won because conservative voters stayed home. He had promise and he let so many down, what did Clinton have? And that is why conservative voters had to get out and vote.
Trump prefers isolationism on a world scale, Clinton voted to take us to war in Iraq and to overthrow Libya's Gaddafi, all in the guise of being ""muscular.""

I grew up in a working class family and have experienced the deep racism of a society that views Vietnamese Americans as the targets of war. I've lived through successive Democratic Party administrations with little to celebrate. The Bill Clinton era brought NAFTA, which outsourced my Aunt's union job and forced her into the low-wage service sector. My mother never found a living wage job and relied on my father's public sector union position to meet our family's needs. In the 21st century, Obama expanded Bush‚Äôs War on Terror, which merged my father‚Äôs job with into the Department of Homeland Security.
Downward pressure on wages and working conditions forced my father to refinance our home multiple times to pay college expenses for my sister and I. Even then, my sister and I graduated with large sums of student debt. I have worked four jobs in three years and only one has paid a truly living wage. Another four years of a Democratic Party President was not going to make anything better for my family. That is not to say that Donald Trump was the answer to the structural problems of exploitation. But Trump's victory is not the end of the world, either.
Trump's victory is the product of global capitalism‚Äôs decay. Millions of people voted for Trump for a variety of reasons, namely because he clearly labeled problems and outlined solutions to them. I don‚Äôt agree with all of his solutions. White nationalism stains his domestic and international agenda. Trump‚Äôs call to further militarize the US-Mexico border yet make peace with Russia is a contradiction in and of itself. A white nationalist billionaire who speaks the language of racism on the one hand and the interests of peace on the other is not exactly a model of consistency.
However, Trump‚Äôs consistency is not the most important aspect of this election. Millions of people have shown their disgust with the two-party system of the capitalist class. A number of mostly white workers and whites from the petty business class voted for Trump. Trump also received more votes than expected from the Black and Latino electorate. Meanwhile, the elections produced a low turnout for Clinton from the historic Democratic Party bases of Black voters, Latino voters, and women voters. Clinton may have won the electoral vote, but the balance of forces ensured the ruling class would gamble on Trump. Trump's base of white workers and petty business elites angered by thirty years of monopoly capitalist assault are more of a threat at the moment than the millions of Democratic party voters who are now without a home. The round table of elites called the Electoral College could not afford any more damage to the Democratic Party than what transpired during the election.
So the Democratic Party is now on its deathbed and there is only one class of people willing to resurrect it: white liberals. A large section of the Democratic Party base wanted Bernie Sanders to be their next President. They did not hold their nose for Clinton. The legitimate concerns that immigrants and oppressed people possess with Trump's racism should not be led into the bowels of the Democratic Party. Yet for white liberals, this is the ultimate mission.
MORE... Brian Cloughley: ‚ÄúThe Greatest Achievement of Mr. Trump would be Engage in Positive Discussions with Russia and China‚Ä?Arise President Trump (or Why it's not the End of the World as We Know it) Trump's sexual predator characteristics - His Grandfather was a pimp, but at least he paid the women he hired The significance of the GOP's attempted purge of Donald Trump Trump's victory has energized the white liberal section of the United States to fight back. White liberals began the process in a deep state of mourning over Clinton's loss. They then placed blame for Trump‚Äôs victory on Russia, low-voter turnout, and the white working class. White liberals have blamed everyone except Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Now, white liberals in the US hope to wage a crusade against Trump in hopes of a Democratic Party recovery. It is all too clear that their primary intention is to get ahead of the genuine forces that rejected both Trump and Clinton and lead them into the Democratic Party graveyard.
White liberals love to hide their own racism and ruling class sensibilities through a process of appeal and betrayal. They speak with the authority of moral righteousness on the one hand and the knife of oppression on the other. They talk down to the struggle of peoples oppressed by white supremacy and attempt to steer it in a way that benefits their class interests. White liberals despise the working class because they understand that there will come a day when it destroys the system that they profit so handsomely from.
White liberals usually originate from the ruling class, the managerial class, and various stripes of the professionalized sector. Their class has ordained themselves the true leaders of ""human rights"" based on race, gender, and sexual equality. However, White liberals speak of human rights on the basis of a complete abandonment of the material struggle for liberation. In other words, the white liberal is the ultimate counterrevolutionary force in US society. It has wielded the so-called struggle for human rights as a weapon to prevent the emergence of class-consciousness among the oppressed and its genuine leaders.
The 2016 elections have shown that the broad class arrangement of white liberals is indeed in crisis and only has itself to blame. White liberals cannot acknowledge that it was their brand of politics that led to the Trump moment. Their dominance over the left in the US ensured that no organized force existed strong enough to challenge the ills of capitalist decline. Millions of people voted for Sanders based on his demands for material relief. Millions of people voted for Trump for the similar reasons, his racism and sexism notwithstanding. Whatever racism and sexism existed in his rhetoric could not ""trump"" the fact that the trade deals and wars he spoke out against in part drove ordinary people to vote for him. If the Trump base wanted racism and sexism primarily, they would of voted for Ted Cruz or Jeb Bush in the primaries.
So White liberal anger about Trump's victory is not directed at sexism, racism, or any other aspect of Trump's politics. White liberals are afraid of the sharpening contradictions of US society that threaten to squeeze them out of their privileged position under the racist and capitalist order. Millions of people are now asking where white liberalism was during the massive loss in working class income and wealth that occurred over the last forty years? Where were the White liberals during the endless wars that have been waged even more fervently by Democratic Party Administrations? Where were the White liberals during the erection of the largest police and prison state in the world, the institutions that murder and incarcerate Black Americans in record numbers and deport undocumented peoples at historic rates?
The answer is that white liberals were supporting the US capitalist system's assault on the oppressed every step of the way. This is what they are trying to hide with their anger over Trump. We cannot defeat Trump's white nationalism if the white liberal is not defeated with just as much vigor. White liberal ideology has a history of infecting social movements. As it spreads, it breeds the germs of Democratic Party control over these movements. But the Democratic Party made its own bed by acting as the more effective evil of the ruling class. If a powerful movement of the working class is to emerge in the age of Trump, then we must fight hard against the white liberal forces working hard to resuscitate the Democratic Party and build an independent party of our own.",english,2016-11-14T15:28:07.072+02:00,ahtribune.com,DE,,Defeating White Liberalism in the Age of Trump,0.04,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/Donald_J._Trump_149fc.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

China has warned Donald Trump that he will be defying the wishes of the entire planet if he acts on his vow to back away from the Paris climate agreement after he becomes US president next January.
The election of climate change skeptic Donald Trump as president is likely to end the U.S. leadership role in the international fight against global warming and may lead to the emergence of a new and unlikely champion: China.
‚ÄúIt is global society‚Äôs will that all want to co-operate to combat climate change,‚Ä?a senior Beijing negotiator said in Morocco on Friday, at the first round of UN talks since the Paris deal was sealed last December. The Chinese negotiators added that ‚Äúany movement by the new US government‚Ä?would not affect their transition towards becoming a greener economy.
China worked closely with the administration of outgoing President Barack Obama to build momentum ahead of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The partnership of the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters helped get nearly 200 countries to support the pact at the historic meet in France's capital.
By contrast, Trump has called global warming a hoax created by China to give it an economic advantage and said he plans to remove the United States from the historic climate agreement, as well as reverse many of Obama's measures to combat climate change.

China is expected to play a pivotal role in consolidating and enhancing South-South partnership, particularly when it comes to issues related to climate change.
China is steadily ramping up efforts to assist other developing countries in addressing climate change, a gesture that has received wide welcome.
Speaking to the Chinese news agency Xinhua, Moroccan Foreign Minister and Climate Change Conference (COP22) President Salaheddine Mezouar said that China has an ‚Äúextremely important role to play in accompanying, reinforcing and boosting South-South partnership and support sustainable development policies in the African continent‚Ä?
Xie Ji, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation to the ongoing 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22), said on Nov. 7 that China has ironed out a concrete program to help other developing countries to become more climate-resilient. ""We will help build up ten low-carbon pilot zones, launch 100 climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, and offer training programs for 1,000 climate-related professionals,"" he said.
What Xie called the ""10-100-1000"" project is part of the effort that China has made in recent years to help other developing countries fight against climate change. The country has earmarked a total of 580 million yuan (about US$85 million) since 2011 to help developing countries, according to Zhang Yucheng, deputy director of the International Cooperation Division of the Department of Climate Change of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).

Saudi Arabia has warned Donald Trump that the incoming US president will risk the health of his country‚Äôs economy if he acts on his election promises to block oil imports.
Over the course of the two-year American election process, Republican nominee Trump promised on the campaign trail to divest U.S. interests from ‚Äúour foes and the oil cartels,‚Ä?referring mainly to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which the KSA is the largest producer and de facto leader.

Saudi Arabia is the U.S.‚Ä?largest Middle Eastern oil supplier, though the North American country gets most of its energy from domestic and Canadian sources.
Al-Falih added that the free trade energy culture currently in place benefits the United States because it has created a refining industry and ignited a job-hungry shale revolution.

Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, came back to haunt Democrats last week after FBI officials uncovered more than 650,000 new emails on a device of his, some of which may have originated from Clinton‚Äôs unsecured server.

NEW YORK ‚Ä?Today was not a great day for the Clinton campaign. Recently leaked emails from within the Clinton campaign have reached the ears of some prominent members of the Black Lives Matter community ‚Ä?members whom the emails were about. They are particularly upset about a series of emails that seems how to best ‚Äúuse‚Ä?the victims of gun violence while making sure those victims were black. Understandably, some of the members have taken to speaking out against her campaign now. In a word, they‚Äôre pissed. 
Erica Garner, the daughter of controversial man who died after being put in ‚Äúchokehold‚Ä?by a New York officer has been one of the most vocal critics. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm troubled by the revelation that you and this campaign actually discussed ‚Äòusing‚Ä?Eric Garner ‚Ä? Why would you want to ‚Äòuse‚Ä?my dad?‚Ä?she tweeted. 
That was way earlier today. She hasn‚Äôt stopped since: ‚ÄúIf you vote for her (Clinton) by default you are endorsing her and whatever she does.

Last week, the Pentagon issued a Defense Department directive that allows ‚ÄúDepartment of Defense (D0D) personnel to carry firearms and employ deadly force while performing official duties.‚Ä?
The Defense Department has been working on changing the ‚Äúgun-free‚Ä?zones on domestic military basis for several years in light of the deadly shootings at military sites in recent years. 
Military.com reports that the directive ‚Äúalso provides detailed guidance to the services for permitting soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guard personnel to carry privately owned firearms on DoD property.‚Ä?It authorizes ‚Äúcommanders, 05 and above‚Ä¶[to] grant permission to DoD personnel requesting to carry a privately owned firearm (concealed or open carry) on DoD property for a personal protection purpose not related to performance of an official duty or status.‚Ä?
The directive also makes clear that DoD will consider further changes to grant ‚Äú[standard] authorizations for other DoD personnel, who are trained in the scaled use of force or who have been previously qualified to use a government-issued firearm, to carry a firearm in the performance of official duties on DoD property.‚Ä?This would allow DoD with certain combat training to carry firearms without going through the additional step of making application with a commander. 
Kim Smith at Conservative Tribune notes that the policy was a response to an NRA-backed provision in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act that required the Defense Department to allow more service members to carry firearms on base. 
‚ÄúIt is a good first step in that it recognizes personal protection is a valid issue for service members, but there are many roadblocks in the way of making that option available,‚Ä?NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told the Washington Free Beacon . 
Those wishing to apply for permission to carry a firearm must be at least 21 years old and meet all federal, state and local laws, the directive said. 
It would appear that the Pentagon saw no problems with implementing a policy for which President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support. 
President-elect Donald Trump ran on removing gun-free zones from military bases. On July 9, 2015, Breitbart News reported that Trump pledged to end the gun-free scenarios for U.S. troops by ‚Äú[mandating] that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases.‚Ä?
The immediate institution of this directive probably left President Barack Obama incensed, but he undoubtedly realized that there was nothing he could do to prevent its implementation in a couple of months anyway. And that‚Äôs good news because it works to ensure the safety of our troops, which should always be a priority.

While the mainstream media has been working day and night promoting Hillary Clinton‚Äôs candidacy, it has largely ignored or downplayed violent attacks against supporters of Donald Trump. 
But assaults on Trump supporters appear to be growing increasingly common as Election Day approaches and tensions intensify. Reports of Trump lawn signs and banners being stolen and defaced are everywhere on social media. 
Making matters worse, undercover video evidence emerged showing senior Democrat operatives Robert Creamer and Scott Foval acknowledging using dirty, likely illegal tricks against the Trump campaign. Their goal was to generate negative media coverage of Trump rallies by fomenting violence at them. The media eagerly used the various fisticuffs and melees the Democrats created to attempt to discredit Trump by depicting his supporters as violent, knuckle-dragging crazies. 
{snip} 
Despite their aversion to covering stories that put Trump in a sympathetic light, members of the media had no choice but to cover the extremely newsworthy Oct. 15 weekend firebombing of Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. Gov. Pat McCrory called the arson ‚Äúan attack on our democracy,‚Ä?while one GOP official called it an act of ‚Äúpolitical terrorism.‚Ä?Spray-painted on the building next door were a swastika and the sentence ‚ÄúNazi Republicans get out of town or else.‚Ä?
Meanwhile, most physical attacks on Trump supporters make only local news outlet‚Äìif that. Rarely do such assaults get mentioned on the evening TV broadcast news or in The New York Times or The Washington Post. That‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt fit the leftist narrative that Republicans are violent, racist, Islamophobic homophobes. 
{snip} 
Here is a compilation of some of the attacks on Trump supporters: 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?‚Ä?
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. ‚ÄúThe two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ‚Äòsome thugs‚Ä?that a barmaid called out from the back.‚Ä?Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a ‚ÄúBlue Lives Matter‚Ä?shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Ä?baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
On Sept. 26 at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, as the first presidential debate was about to get underway, a woman wearing Trump campaign apparel was assaulted while heading to a debate watch event. {snip} 
On Aug. 19 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Trump supporters had to run a gauntlet of angry protesters to get into a Trump fundraiser at the Minneapolis Convention Center. When they left after the event they were hit, pushed, and spit on. 
{snip} 
On Aug. 3 in Bloomfield, New Jersey, an assailant attacked a 62-year-old man who was walking down the street wearing a pro-Trump T-shirt, local police said. ‚ÄúThe motorist inquired why [the man] was wearing the shirt, directing profanities at him,‚Ä?a police spokesman said. ‚ÄúThe [victim] continued to walk away as [the] motorist followed him.‚Ä?The motorist hit the man several times with a crowbar, causing injuries to his arms, hands, and thighs, 
{snip} 
This is not an exhaustive list of violent attacks on Trump supporters. 
No doubt there will be plenty more such assaults in the final two weeks, as Americans head to the polls. 
And Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign may be involved in those attacks.",english,2016-10-27T06:53:36.447+03:00,amren.com,US,94243,Anti-Trump Violence Sweeps the Nation,0,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Chicago aldermen on Tuesday hit Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump where it hurts‚Äìin his formidable ego‚Äìfor using a spike in homicides and shootings to paint a ‚Äúdistorted caricature‚Ä?of the city. 
The City Council‚Äôs Transportation Committee unanimously agreed to strip Trump of a recognition he covets: ‚ÄúTrump Plaza,‚Ä?the honorary designation for the east side of Wabash Avenue between Illinois Street and the Chicago River, outside the 96-story Trump International Hotel & Tower. 
‚ÄúWe can actually use his own words against him: ‚ÄòWhen you hit us, we hit back,‚Ä?‚Ä?said Transportation Committee Chairman Anthony Beale (9th). 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve hit Chicago numerous times. . . . When you hit Chicago, Chicago hits back.‚Ä?
{snip} 
As for the honorary street designation, one of the Trump Plaza signs already has been stolen. So only one more needs to be removed. That will be done post-haste, if the full City Council approves the punishment, thanks to a so-called ‚Äúpending passage‚Ä?letter that Beale promised to sign. 
Reilly said Trump no longer deserves the honor after making political hay at Chicago‚Äôs expense in a way that has damaged the city‚Äôs reputation on the global stage. 
Trump‚Äôs decision to portray Chicago as a ‚Äúwar zone‚Ä?that needs stop-and-frisk during the first presidential debate was the final straw. 
‚ÄúHe was comparing us to a war-torn, third-world country. That was a set of comments that didn‚Äôt just insult me. It insulted anyone who loves this great city,‚Ä?Reilly said.

From the start of Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign, the media have covered him dishonestly. They have consistently portrayed him as a closet ‚Äúwhite supremacist‚Ä?who deliberately appeals to ‚Äúracists.‚Ä?They have tried to tie him to a wicked movement known as the ‚ÄúAlt-Right.‚Ä?They are now working on another dishonest angle: that Donald Trump is ‚Äúmainstreaming hate‚Ä?and bringing ‚Äúracism‚Ä?into public discourse. The media clearly want to stampede voters into Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs camp so as to spare us the agony of a ‚Äúracist‚Ä?in the White House. 
The demonization campaign has backfired. By trying to hang racial dissidents around Donald Trump‚Äôs neck, the media have given American Renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before. At the same time, constant shouts of ‚Äúracist‚Ä?and ‚Äúbigot‚Ä?don‚Äôt seem to hurt Mr. Trump: instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility. The biggest irony, though, is that Donald Trump is probably not one of us at all. But even small deviations from the cast-iron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about Donald Trump as a secret David Duke fan. 
Media dishonesty started immediately. When Mr. Trump pointed out that some immigrants from Mexico were criminals, the press acted as if he had said all Mexican immigrants are criminals. Then, when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call ‚Äúhaters‚Ä?and ‚Äúwhite supremacists‚Ä?liked Mr. Trump, there was no end of articles with titles such as: ‚Ä?Meet the Horde of Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and Other Extremist Leaders Endorsing Donald Trump ,‚Ä?‚Ä?Top Racists And Neo-Nazis Back Donald Trump ,‚Ä?‚Ä?‚ÄòHeil Donald Trump‚Ä? Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists Show Support ,‚Ä?and ‚Ä?The White Nationalists Who Support Donald Trump .‚Ä?
These articles had a simpleminded purpose: discredit Mr. Trump by parading before the reader any Nazi, Kluxer, or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate. The implication was that if ‚Äúracists‚Ä?were going to vote for Donald Trump he must be ‚Äúracist,‚Ä?too. 
This was deceitful and one-sided. When the chairman of the American Communist Party endorsed Hillary Clinton , no one suggested this meant she was a communist. 
It is true that Mr. Trump gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet ‚Äúbigot‚Ä?because he did not repudiate ‚Äúracists‚Ä?with the snorts of indignation respectability requires. There was the famous exchange in February when a reporter pushed Mr. Trump to disavow an endorsement from David Duke. As The Hill reported it: ‚Ä?‚ÄòDavid Duke endorsed me? OK, alright. I disavow, OK?‚Ä?Trump said, seeking to quickly move on to another question.‚Ä?
That same month, there was another famous exchange with Jake Tapper of CNN : 
Tapper : Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don‚Äôt want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election? 
Donald Trump : Well just so you understand, I don‚Äôt know anything about David Duke, OK? I don‚Äôt know anything about what you‚Äôre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know, did he endorse me, or what‚Äôs going on? Because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. 
The media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy. ‚ÄúTrump refuses to disavow white supremacists! That‚Äôs because he is one!‚Ä?
There are far better explanations. First, Donald Trump is a pugnacious man. He doesn‚Äôt like being pushed around by anyone, especially not by journalists who hate him. If Mr. Tapper had belligerently demanded that Mr. Trump agree that the sky is blue, Mr. Trump would have bridled at that. 
Second, Donald Trump probably doesn‚Äôt know anything about David Duke or white supremacy. I would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of David Duke or any other alleged ‚Äúwhite supremacist.‚Ä?It is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers, not some carefully concealed racial consciousness. 
The press has also pounced on Donald Trump‚Äôs retweets of ‚Äúracist‚Ä?material, which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist. Business Insider, for example, published this shocking story: ‚Ä?5 times Donald Trump has engaged with alt-right racists on Twitter .‚Ä?Not one of these tweets is obviously ‚Äúracist,‚Ä?and it would be surprising if Mr. Trump or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets @realDonaldTrump has sent during the campaign. 
Now the press is working on another smear-Trump angle. Recently, I have been contacted by journalists from such places as Bloomberg News, Reuters, and the New York Times , who clearly want to write that Donald Trump is ‚Äúmainstreaming hate,‚Ä?that he is responsible for a huge surge in the Alt-Right. They want to know about all the people who have been flocking to AmRen.com because of what Donald Trump says. They want me to tell them about people who have been ‚Äúemboldened‚Ä?to ‚Äúspeak out against minorities‚Ä?because Donald Trump has led the way. They would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting ‚Äúnigger!‚Ä?because Mr. Trump wants to take a hard look at Muslim immigrants. 
I have explained to them as patiently as I can that they have it the wrong way around. No one comes looking for AmRen.com because Donald Trump wants to build a wall. They come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that Mr. Trump is a ‚Äúracist.‚Ä?They come looking for us because Mrs. Clinton kindly called attention to us by complaining about the Alt-Right and her ‚Äúbasket of deplorables.‚Ä?I also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold Donald Trump responsible for the views of certain people who support him, few people would have heard of the Alt-Right. In their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors, they are promoting the Alt-Right, not Donald Trump. 
I explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before, for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign. It is Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Black Lives Matters, and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way‚Ä?not Donald Trump. This will not change whether Mr. Trump wins or loses. The top landing pages on AmRen.com are analyses of race and crime‚Äìsomething Mr. Trump never talks about. 
I also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think Mr. Trump has mainstreamed ‚Äúhate,‚Ä?by which they mean sensible observations about race. I ask them to name a single person who has been ‚Äúemboldened‚Ä?to say something ‚Äúracist‚Ä?just because Donald Trump is the GOP nominee. Of course, they can‚Äôt. If anything, it is the opposite. Mr. Trump has been called every name under the sun for the mildest, most common-sense observations about Muslims and immigration. Anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever. Things could change if Mr. Trump becomes president, but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas. 
What Donald Trump has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that Mitt Romney and John McCain are no different from Barack Obama when it comes to preserving whites, their society, and their culture. I know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in November. I know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the Trump campaign. 
I point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about: giving the voters real choices. I note that the Trump/Clinton contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election. Haven‚Äôt our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement, especially among the young? Well, now they have engagement, alright, but they don‚Äôt like it. They don‚Äôt like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a ‚Ä?threat to democracy .‚Ä?Liberals are such transparent hypocrites. They claim to love democracy, but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to. 
The whole Trump-is-a-racist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become. I may be wrong, but I have no reason to think Donald Trump thinks at all as we do. He has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary American with normal instincts: He doesn‚Äôt want criminals sneaking across the border, he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy, he doesn‚Äôt see why we need more Muslims, and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare. Millions of ordinary Americans clearly agree with him, and not because they are racially aware. It is because they are decent, fair-minded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways. 
I am convinced that Mr. Trump does not have a sophisticated understanding of race. So far as I can tell, he doesn‚Äôt have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything. He has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time, but not because he is one of us. 
Maybe‚Äìjust maybe‚Äìhe will move in our direction. It‚Äôs not impossible to imagine a President Trump asking, in an offhand way, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the United States?‚Ä?Or he might casually note that you can‚Äôt expect as many blacks as Asians in AP classes because they don‚Äôt have the same levels of intelligence. But I can imagine the opposite, too: President Trump so bogged down in Beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall. 
There is one thing that Donald Trump has changed. He has proven that Republican bromides about taxes and small government don‚Äôt excite people. He has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties. He has proven that Americans do want their country to come first. They don‚Äôt want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries. 
And even if he has not ‚Äúmainstreamed racism,‚Ä?he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an American. On October 11, Roger Cohen wrote in the New York Times that Donald Trump is a ‚Äúphony, liar, blowhard, cheat, bully, misogynist, demagogue, predator, bigot, bore, egomaniac, racist, sexist, sociopath,‚Ä?and a ‚Äúdictator-in-waiting with a brat‚Äôs temper and a prig‚Äôs scowl.‚Ä?This must be one of the most unhinged, hysterical outbursts in the history of American political journalism. And it is unusual only for its wordiness, not its tone. 
Don‚Äôt the editors of the Times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more Americans believe in Bigfoot (29 percent) than trust newspapers (20 percent)? Virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at Donald Trump and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself. Open, petulant bias is driving more and more Americans to social media and to sites like AmRen.com for their news. 
Despite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire American ruling class, Donald Trump is going to get close to half of the vote on November 8. Some 60 million people are going to vote for a man for whom Roger Cohen has emptied his dictionary trying to insult. Only one major newspaper has endorsed Donald Trump. Only one . And this is a man whom the American people might choose as their president. What better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion, between what Americans think and what our rulers want us to think? Donald Trump has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity. 
Whether he wins or not, whether he is one of us or not, Donald Trump has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors. Voters‚Äìfinally‚Äìhave a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system. On November 8th they could bring it crashing down, but even if it still stands, it is visibly weakened, badly discredited. These are the perfect conditions in which our ideas will flourish as never before.",english,2016-10-29T04:38:59.696+03:00,amren.com,US,94243,Media Self-Destruct over Trump,0,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

To many, Donald Trump‚Äôs pledge to build a wall along the US-Mexico border is unrealistic. But for Jim Chilton, it‚Äôs the only way he‚Äôll get a good night‚Äôs sleep. 
The 77-year-old, a fifth-generation rancher on the Arizona border with Mexico, says he has grown weary of seeing drug smugglers‚Äìrather than just cattle‚Äìon his ranch and a wall is the answer to his troubles. 
‚ÄúI really admire Trump for having the insight and the knowledge to know what‚Äôs wrong with the current border system,‚Ä?he said, as he surveyed the sprawling desert plains of his 75-square-mile ranch that stretches to the Mexican border. 
‚ÄúWe need a wall. I‚Äôve been saying that for 10 years . . . and we need roads along the boundary and the border patrol to be deployed there and not let anybody in,‚Ä?he added. ‚ÄúIt would make my life so much better and I‚Äôd feel more secure.‚Ä?
{snip} 
Chilton, who admits that Trump was not his first choice among the Republican candidates for the White House, says building a barrier to secure the 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) US-Mexico frontier not only makes sense but is also a question of national security. 
{snip} 
‚ÄúI live in a no-man‚Äôs land. I live in a land that is occupied by the Sinaloa drug cartel,‚Ä?he sighed, pointing to mountains on his ranch where he said scouts equipped with sophisticated equipment are posted as lookouts for smugglers. 
‚ÄúI have seen cartel scouts on these two mountains before . . . and even in my front yard,‚Ä?he said. ‚ÄúI wave at them and they often yell ‚Äòhola‚Ä?and wave back.‚Ä?
Chilton‚Äìwho keeps a gun holstered on his hip, a rifle by his front door and a pistol by his bedside‚Äìadded that he and other ranchers are also in favor of beefed up security in remote border areas as extremist groups like Islamic State (IS) may be using them to slip operatives into the United States. 
{snip} 
But beyond the drug cartels and threat of terrorism, Chilton insists that Trump‚Äôs wall is all the more necessary for humanitarian reasons. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just outrageous for me to find a dead body on my ranch. It‚Äôs outrageous for the border patrol to find a dead body and it‚Äôs outrageous for my cowboys,‚Ä?he said, referring to migrants who often die making the crossing into the US through the brutal desert. 
‚ÄúThis is as big a humanitarian issue as it is a national security issue.‚Ä?

But a new Pew Research Center survey finds that Clinton backers‚Äìparticularly highly educated ones‚Äìhave more difficulty respecting Trump supporters than the other way around. Nearly six-in-ten registered voters who back Clinton (58%) say they have a ‚Äúhard time‚Ä?respecting someone who supports Trump for president; 40% say they have ‚Äúno trouble‚Ä?with it. Nearly the opposite is true among Trump supporters, with 56% saying they have no trouble respecting someone who backs Clinton and 40% saying they do have trouble with it. Among Clinton supporters, those with a college degree have a harder time respecting someone who prefers Trump than those who have not graduated from college. About two-thirds (66%) of college graduates who back Clinton say they have a hard time, compared with a narrower majority (53%) among Clinton supporters who have not completed college. White women who back Clinton also are particularly likely to say they have difficulty respecting those who favor Trump: 68% say this, compared with a smaller share of white men (59%) and fewer nonwhites.

She Can‚Äôt Ignore Donald Trump‚Äôs.,"Loading Posted on November 2, 2016 This Professor Devotes Her Life to Countering Dangerous Speech. She Can‚Äôt Ignore Donald Trump‚Äôs. Colby Itkowitz, Washington Post, October 24, 2016 
When Susan Benesch began looking at how speech could incite mass violence, her research took her to far-flung places like Kenya and Burma. 
Lately, she‚Äôs been unable to ignore a case study at home in the United States. 
The American University law professor and Harvard University faculty associate has grappled for months with whether Donald Trump‚Äôs rhetoric constitutes dangerous speech as she has come to define it. She has examined election-year speech before, but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great. 
But in the past week, with Trump claiming that the election system and the media are rigged against him, his messages have the type of undertone that increases the risk of violence between groups, she said. 
Benesch, 52, has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech. To rise to that level, at least two of these five indicators must be true: A powerful speaker with a high degree of influence over the audience. The audience has grievances and fears that the speaker can cultivate. A speech act that is clearly understood as a call to violence. A social or historical context that is propitious for violence, for any of a variety of reasons, including long-standing competition between groups for resources, lack of efforts to solve grievances or previous episodes of violence. A means of dissemination that is influential in itself, for example because it is the sole or primary source of news for the relevan t audience. 
‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it,‚Ä?Benesch said in a recent interview. ‚ÄúThe meaning is so often ambiguous.‚Ä?
But when Trump said his supporters could use the Second Amendment against Hillary Clinton, ‚Äúit seems to me impossible that people didn‚Äôt understand that as a reference to violence,‚Ä?she said. Or when he suggested that Clinton and President Obama were founders of the Islamic State, something he alluded to again at Wednesday‚Äôs final debate, that was a ‚Äúhallmark of dangerous speech to describe an in-group member as the enemy,‚Ä?she said. 
And now, with Trump trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him, he‚Äôs definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting. Direct incitement of violence is illegal, but Trump falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience. 
Because of that, it‚Äôs still a gray area that surrounds whether Trump does use dangerous speech. 
‚ÄúTrump may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of U.S. democracy,‚Ä?Benesch said. ‚ÄúSome of them‚Äìthose who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messages‚Äìmay therefore be more likely to commit violence. However, the United States is not in danger of mass intergroup violence, in my view. It is deeply irresponsible, though, since it can undermine some Americans‚Ä?belief in our own democratic institutions, which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward.‚Ä?

‚ÄúHere in Minnesota you have seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state, without your knowledge, without your support or approval,‚Ä?Trump said at a Minneapolis rally Sunday afternoon.

It‚Äôs no secret that campaign contributions from higher education have favored Democratic candidates for years. When it comes to the current presidential race, however, data show that the gap between left and right has grown from a rift into a chasm. 
A Chronicle analysis of Federal Election Commission data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics shows Donald Trump raising a tiny fraction of the campaign money that the previous two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, drew from higher-education professionals over comparable time periods. 
Across higher education, donations in congressional and Senate races showed a ratio of Democratic to Republican giving similar to that of the two previous presidential-campaign cycles. But support for Mr. Trump stood at less than 8 percent of what Senator McCain raised from higher-ed professionals, and around 4 percent of the donations that Mr. Romney pulled in over the same time period, once the figures were adjusted for inflation. 
As of June 30, faculty members and others who work in higher education had donated $76,668 to Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign committee and to support ‚Äúsuper PACs‚Äù‚Äìindependent committees that can raise and spend unlimited funds. By comparison, people working in academe had given $6.4 million to Hillary Clinton. Those figures account for donations of at least $200 that the Center for Responsive Politics has determined come from people associated with higher education. They are the most-recent figures available.

REUTERS 
Donald Trump‚Äôs star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was defaced by a vandal wielding a sledgehammer and a pick-axe on Wednesday in an act captured on video, police said. 
Los Angeles police expect to arrest someone for the vandalism, which left Trump‚Äôs name scratched out of the star, the emblem in the middle dislodged and chips missing. 
A video posted at Deadline.com, a Hollywood media industry website, showed a man wearing a hard-hat and reflective vest swinging a sledgehammer and pick-axe in the pre-dawn darkness. 
The area had been cordoned off with traffic barriers and cones, giving it the appearance of a legitimate work site. 
The Republican presidential nominee, real estate developer and reality TV star has faced several large protests during his campaign appearances in California, where polls show him far behind Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. 
The former host of the NBC show ‚ÄúThe Apprentice,‚Ä?Trump received his Walk of Fame star in 2007. A spokeswoman for Trump could not be reached for comment. 
Los Angeles police spokeswoman Liliana Preciado at the scene confirmed investigators have video capturing the vandalism attack and she said police expected to arrest whoever was responsible. 
Los Angeles-based City News Service reported a man identifying himself as James Lambert Otis said he damaged the installation ‚Äúto make a point.‚Ä?
City News reported the man said he had family members who were victims of sexual assault and had intended to remove the star, which he was unable to do, and auction it off to benefit women who have alleged Trump groped them. Trump has denied the allegations. 
Otis could not be reached for comment on the report. 
Trump drew widespread condemnations from voters and a number of Republican elected officials after a 2005 video emerged in which he was heard talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. 
His star on the Walk of Fame was previously targeted. 
In the summer, a street artist erected a tiny wall around the star, complete with miniature American flags and barbed wire. The art piece, which was later removed, made light of Trump‚Äôs campaign pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. 
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce administers the hundreds of star plaques on sidewalks in the Los Angeles neighborhood. They are purchased for $30,000 each. 
Leron Gubler, president and CEO of the chamber, said in a statement the star would be covered for several days during repairs.",english,2016-10-27T14:58:47.676+03:00,amtvmedia.com,US,,Reuters Donald Trump‚Äôs Hollywood Walk of Fame star vandalized on video,0,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/TRUMP.jpeg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

While speaking to supporters in Cincinnati on Monday, Democrat Hillary Clinton hinted at a second civil war if GOP nominee Donald Trump wins, Breitbart.com reported. 
Charlie Spiering wrote: 
‚ÄúHe has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart,‚Ä?Clinton said to supporters in Cincinnati, Ohio on Halloween. 
Clinton specifically referred to the Civil War, suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from Donald Trump. 
‚ÄúAbraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges ‚Ä?the challenge posed by slavery ‚Ä?and we fought a civil war,‚Ä?she said. 
She warned voters that it was time for the country to take the divisions in the country seriously. 
‚ÄúBut we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together,‚Ä?she added, failing to admit that her side is the one that has divided America by race, class and gender. 
She also claimed that Trump would start a nuclear war if a foreign leader got under his skin. 
‚ÄúI know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don‚Äôt think so,‚Ä?she said at a rally in Kent, Ohio, earlier in the day. 
A post at Barracuda Brigade observed: 
Liberals especially the Clinton are always projecting. Anything that they accuse the other side of is what they are doing. She suggests that her message is one of ‚Äúhope and change‚Ä?when in fact it is just more of the same. 
Moreover, Trump has spent a great deal of time talking about policies and issues while Clinton & Co. have done absolutely nothing but engage in fear-mongering and fingerpointing. 
Still, we have to ask ‚Ä?was Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúhint‚Ä?a ‚Äúwarning‚Ä?or a ‚Äúthreat?‚Ä?

USA TODAY 
The man who caused a commotion at a Donald Trump rally Saturday said he‚Äôs a registered Republican who wanted only to show his displeasure with his party‚Äôs nominee. 
Members of the audience at the event for the GOP presidential nominee tackled Austyn Crites, 33, of Reno after someone yelled ‚Äúgun‚Ä?while others were trying to rip away his anti-Trump sign. 
‚ÄúI just went with sign that said ‚ÄòRepublicans Against Trump,‚Ä?‚Ä?Crites said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sign that you can find online. I held up the sign and initially people around me were just booing me telling me to get out of there. Then a couple of these guys tried grabbing the sign out of my hands.‚Ä?
Crites had no weapon. Secret Service agents later released a statement to that effect and let him go without charges. 
Agents whisked Trump offstage because Crites was near the front of the auditorium at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center. 
Crites said he holds no ill will toward the Secret Service or Reno police, who were just doing their job. 
‚ÄúI was trying to get the Secret Service‚Äôs attention for them to respond,‚Ä?said Michael Newton, 45, of Santa Rosa, Calif., who helped restrain Crites. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt respond. I thought I had to do something. I put my knee on what I think was his head, so I‚Äôm not really sure. There were five guys on him and he was moving. I tried to help them immobilize him.‚Ä?In final Colorado push, Trump urges supporters to hand-deliver ballots 
Newton said he felt as if Crites were the aggressor. 
‚ÄúI saw his hand contact someone‚Äôs face,‚Ä?he said. ‚ÄúMaybe two people.‚Ä?
Crites said he didn‚Äôt strike anyone, but after he was taken to the ground, he felt as if he were being mobbed. 
‚ÄúMultiple people just tackled me down, kicking me choking me and just beating me up,‚Ä?he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when things even got crazier. I was on the ground and people were holding my arms, legs and I kept saying I can barely breathe. I was turning my neck just to get a little bit of air to keep from passing out.‚Ä?
That‚Äôs when police intervened, taking Crites away in handcuffs. 
Newton‚Äôs partner, Donald Newton, 47, of Santa Rosa took video of the immediate aftermath. 
The Secret Service said its investigation is ongoing. The agency uses magnetometers at presidential campaign sites, making it difficult for weapons to be smuggled into events. 
What‚Äôs baffling to Crites is how anyone could have thought he had a gun. His sign was in the air for some time and he wasn‚Äôt making any sudden movements, he said. 
‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt like they noticed something suspicious and tackled me,‚Ä?Crites said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the case.‚Ä?
He said he backs some GOP candidates and just wanted to voice frustration with Trump, not cause panic. 
‚ÄúI love all the people in that rally,‚Ä?he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all fellow Americans. They‚Äôre doing their patriotic duty. They support their candidate. I‚Äôm just there showing that I‚Äôm a Republican. I‚Äôm all of your people‚Äôs brother. I just have a slight difference of opinion.‚Ä?
Later on Facebook, Crites wrote that he has no connection with the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton but has canvassed for her for about three hours, contributed to her campaign and voted for her. 
‚ÄúTake what happened to me tonight as a classic example of dictator incitement of violence ‚Ä?against your own Republican brother with a stupid sign,‚Ä?he wrote. The post and his entire account were taken down soon afterward as some Trump supporters on social media called him a ‚ÄúClinton thug,‚Äù‚ÄúHillary shill‚Ä?and ‚ÄúTrump assassin.‚Ä?
Shortly after the incident at the rally, Trump returned to the stage to raucous applause, thanking the Secret Service and launching back into his prepared remarks. His campaign later issued a statement also thanking the Secret Service and his supporters.

Midway through a stump speech riff lamenting that Hillary Clinton had appeared on stage with less-than-family-friendly musicians like Jay-Z and Beyonce, Donald Trump paused at an election-eve rally in Florida Monday morning to gawk at an attendee‚Äôs mask. 
‚ÄúThis is different than a Billy Graham crusade, but you know what? We‚Äôre all looking for the same thing. We‚Äôre looking for greatness for our country. We‚Äôre looking for religious liberty,‚Ä?the Manhattan billionaire said before the rubber Trump mask caught his eye. ‚ÄúLook at this mask. Look at this mask. Oh wow. Wow, that‚Äôs beautiful. Look at that. Looks just like me.‚Ä?
Trump then left the podium for a few seconds as the mask made its way up to the stage. He returned to the microphone and held up the mask next to his own face, before examining it closer. He held it up once more time and joked ‚Äúnice head of hair, I‚Äôll say that,‚Ä?before tossing it back. 
‚ÄúIs there any place more fun to be than a Trump rally?‚Ä?has asked the crowd before resuming his remarks, turning to his proposal to stimulate job growth in the U.S. by placing a tariff on companies who move production out of the country.

An ex-aide to former President Bill Clinton alleged in a hacked email that Chelsea Clinton used the family‚Äôs charitable foundation to help underwrite her 2010 wedding. 
The 2012 exchange between Doug Band and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta was released by the WikiLeaks organization. Stolen messages have chronicled tensions within the Clinton Foundation between Band and the daughter of the Democratic presidential nominee. 
Band told Podesta that Chelsea Clinton was gossiping to outsiders that she was investigating questionable spending. Band suggested that she is the one who should be scrutinized for ‚Äò‚Äòusing foundation resources for her wedding.‚Äô‚Ä?He did not provide details about this. A Clinton Foundation spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Band was later forced out amid issues with his outside consulting firm.

That‚Äôs the same phrasing the White House used when Comey initially announced that the FBI was looking into more emails related to its investigation of Clinton.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Monday told reporters aboard Air Force One that the White House hasn‚Äôt been briefed on the investigation and didn‚Äôt receive advance notice about Comey‚Äôs latest letter. 
Earnest says Obama still has confidence in Comey.

Philadelphia‚Äôs public transit system will be up and running in time for Election Day now that a weeklong strike has ended. That‚Äôs a relief to the state‚Äôs Democrats. 
Democratic city officials were worried that the strike could affect turnout at the polls Tuesday. Pennsylvania does not offer early voting, so Election Day turnout is key. 
The state has favored Democrats in recent presidential elections, but polls suggest the race is tightening. Democrat Hillary Clinton is counting on strong support in the Philadelphia area. Both candidates are campaigning in the state Tuesday. 
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and the union representing roughly 4,700 transit workers announced a tentative agreement early Monday. Subways were soon operating on a reduced schedule and limited trolled serve was restored.

The Justice Department says it will send more than 500 staffers to 28 states on Election Day to monitor the polls. That‚Äôs a 35 percent reduction from the number four years ago. 
Department officials say personnel will be sent to 67 jurisdictions to watch for potential civil rights violations. Monday‚Äôs announcement comes amid rising concerns about voter intimidation, particularly aimed at minorities. 
The number of personnel is less than the roughly 780 monitors and observers who were dispatched in 2012. 
The Justice Department has said its poll-watching presence has been curtailed by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion that gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. 
In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the department is committed to ensuring that every eligible voter can participate in the election.

Clinton said Monday that while she thinks she has ‚Äò‚Äòsome work to do to bring the country together,‚Äô‚Ä?she wants to be the president for those who vote for her and those who don‚Äôt. She was speaking to reporters at an airport outside New York City. 
Clinton said she has ‚Äò‚Äòa big agenda ahead of us‚Äô‚Ä?and is vowing to ‚Äò‚Äòget a lot done‚Äô‚Ä?if she defeats Republican Donald Trump.

Christie said Monday on ‚Äò‚ÄòCBS This Morning‚Äô‚Ä?that he was runner-up to be Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs vice presidential pick. He denied a report that Trump had offered him the job, then rescinded it. He said he thinks Trump thought Indian governor Mike Pence was the better choice. 
Two of Christie‚Äôs former allies were convicted Friday for their role in re-aligning access lanes to the bridge in a political revenge plot against a Democratic mayor who didn‚Äôt endorse him. 
Christie says he thinks Trump will defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton Tuesday because the momentum is on his side and the country wants change.

Ohio Democrats want the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in their voter intimidation lawsuit in the swing state. 
The party has filed an emergency request for the nation‚Äôs high court to lift a Cincinnati-based federal appeals court order. That ruling Sunday granted the Donald Trump campaign‚Äôs request to block a federal judge‚Äôs restraining order Democrats said was needed to prevent voter intimidation. 
A 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals three-judge panel said Ohio Democrats didn‚Äôt show ‚Äò‚Äòa likelihood of success‚Äô‚Ä?on their case‚Äôs merits. 
The party told the U.S. Supreme Court the appellate judges ruled without reviewing ‚Äò‚Äòcritical evidence‚Äô‚Ä?a lower court judge relied on in ruling that anyone engaging in intimidation or harassment inside or near polling places would face contempt of court charges.

With the cloud of an FBI investigation lifted, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump struck strikingly different tones as they moved into the final hours of a volatile, nearly two-year-long presidential campaign. 
After days of attacks on Trump‚Äôs qualifications and temperament, Clinton cast herself as the candidate of ‚Äò‚Äòhealing and reconciliation,‚Äô‚Ä?perhaps a surprising position for one of the most divisive figures in American politics. Trump, meanwhile, voiced new confidence as he brought his campaign ‚Ä?and his dark visions of a rigged American economic and political system‚Ä?to longtime Democratic strongholds.

The ‚ÄúBad Romance‚Ä?singer, a well-known Hillary Clinton supporter, stood outside Donald Trump ‚Äòs building and held a sign that read ‚ÄúLove trumps hate.‚Ä?As the hours passed Tuesday night and it became clearer that Trump would win the presidency, Gaga tweeted, ‚ÄúIn a room full of hope, we will be heard.

Moments after Donald Trump‚Äôs stunning victory over Hillary Clinton for the White House, protests erupted in California and other states, including people crying ‚ÄúNot my president!‚Ä?
The Los Angeles Times and other media outlets reported anti-Trump protesters amassing around the campuses of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and UC San Diego, among others. 
In Oakland, the overnight protests led to a partial closure of the Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, the Times reported. 
Photos and videos on social media captured the protesters marching and yelling ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs got the power? We got the power,‚Ä?‚ÄúNot my president!‚Ä?and other anti-Trump chants filled with expletives . 
UCSB student newspaper the Daily Nexus reported that hundreds of students left their dorms to protest. In the video captured by the paper below, one student is seen carrying a Mexican flag. 
Likewise, hundreds of students at UC San Diego and UCLA demonstrated on campus early Wednesday morning. There also were reports of protests at UC Santa Cruz and UC Irvine. Officials said there were as many as 3,000 students that marched through the UCLA campus, ABC reported . 
Elsewhere in the country, protests were reported in Portland, Oregon and Washington, D.C. 
In Oakland, authorities said dozens of protesters gathered downtown, while hundreds blocked a local highway.

SILVERISTHENEW 
There‚Äôs more than one way for the establishment to yield power from this election. 
The first path is obvious, direct and potentially deadly. A Hillary presidency will be surrounded by bitter people, and overt uses of power, along with war, increased taxes and thinly-veiled pay-for-play politics benefiting the billionaires who‚Äôve bankrolled her rise to power. 
The other path is less predictable, but possible just the perfect ‚Äúmagic formula‚Ä?they need to get things flowing again. 
The Brexit vote, a by-product of populist anger against economic stagnation and political angst, was secretly a win for those who wield power from the financial sector. 
In the end, the disquiet of the people has proven to be the secret ingredient to stirring something up in an economy otherwise stymied by quantitative easing and dismal economic returns. 
As Zero Hedge explains , it just may be, particularly in light of some of the statements that have been made by significant figures on Wall Street: 
So yes, inflation is possible, it just can‚Äôt coexist with political stability, which may explain why ‚Ä?according to some more conspiratorial elements ‚Ä?a ‚Äúsurprising‚Ä?Trump victory on Tuesday may be assured : after all, what better way to unleash political instability than to inaugurate the candidate who promises a full break with the establishment as we know it. If in the process, it leads to a surge in much needed inflation, now that QE has tried and failed, it‚Äôs a price the establishment, reeling under the weight of record global debt, is willing to pay. 
One River Asset Management‚Äôs Eric Peters laying out his inflationary ‚Äúrevelation‚Ä? ‚ÄúBritish spenders have entirely looked through post-Brexit uncertainty,‚Ä?said Mark Carney [governor of the Bank of England]. ‚Ä?So the Bank of England forecast its biggest inflation overshoot since 1997; expecting 2018 price gains to peak at +2.8%. What‚Äôs it tell us? 
A populist uprising, compromised free trade, immigration restrictions, a 15% currency devaluation, 0.50% interest rates combined with aggressive QE is today‚Äôs magic formula for modestly exceeding a 2% inflation target 2yrs hence. 
[‚Ä¶]we live in the 2010s, and inflationary expectations have succumbed to decades of independent central banking. Economic volatility is remarkably muted too. With it has come a long period of political stability. [‚Ä¶] And we also know that a long period of political stability is drawing to a close. 
But we can‚Äôt be sure that political volatility will increase inflation volatility. Nor can we be sure that it won‚Äôt. It all depends on time and place. And today‚Äôs time and place is something new. 
Is this proof that the elite are secretly planning to make lemonade from the lemons of American discontent and the wild card candidacy of Donald Trump? 
That is a difficult call to make, but it is worth noting that there is clearly an advantage to be held if this outcome does occur. 
As Tumelar notes, the fix is in either way: 
It‚Äôs either inflation by Trump‚Äôs victory or by WW3 started by Hillary Clinton. 
A hard choice for the banksters. 
Of course, the situation is much more complicated than just inflation, or any one factor. There is a great deal of speculation that the end of QE, known to be no longer effective at stimulating the economy has made a stock market collapse inevitable, subject to the Fed raises rates. 
It appears that Yellen has been waiting for the outcome of the election, and one way or another, will dump the next crisis on the next president. If that proves to be Trump, he will be blamed for the downfall‚Ä?meanwhile, there will be those waiting in the shadows to profit from disaster. 
For his part, astute columnist Brandon Smith has consistently argued that the elite have chosen Trump and will allow him to take the presidency ‚Ä?only to use the unpredictability as a catalyst for order out of chaos, and the institution of great political and economic controls over the country: 
The vast majority of analysts in the mainstream and in the alternative media refused to acknowledge the possibility that a successful Brexit actually works in FAVOR of the globalists, because it provides them a perfect scapegoat for a financial crisis that has been broiling for years and is now ready to burst into flames. 
[‚Ä¶] 
I argue that the globalists want Trump in office, just as they wanted the passage of the Brexit. I argue that they need conservative movements to feel as though we have won, so that they can pull the rug out from under us in the near future. I argue that we are being set up. 
Again, the elites are openly telling us what is about to happen. They are telling us that if ‚Äúpopulists‚Ä?(conservatives) gain political power, the system will effectively collapse. To what extent is hard to say, but let‚Äôs assume that the situation will be ugly enough to influence the masses to reconsider the ideal of globalism as a possible solution. The elites are fond of the Hegelian dialectic and the philosophy of ‚Äúorder out of chaos,‚Ä?after all. 
Again, the reasons parallel the reasons that Brexit was able to succeed in spite of fierce establishment opposition. 
The master manipulators are adaptive to any market conditions, and their influence runs deeper than the electorate of any given political season. Its agents and officers instruct the candidates and make demands, not the other way around. 
In a puppeteer‚Äôs world, must we always argue for the existence of puppets on every stage?

The 2016 election has been one for the record books. Somehow, two of the most reviled people in the United States have become the frontrunners for the most powerful job in the country ‚Ä?and the world.
On one hand, there is Donald Trump , the compulsively lying demagogic womanizing egomaniacal billionaire. On the other hand, there is Hillary Clinton, the infinitely corrupt influence peddling war-starter who allegedly cheated her way to the top of the Democratic Party while leaving a number of victims in her wake.
A significant portion of young people would actually prefer that a giant, apocalyptic meteor hit the earth rather than see Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump elected president.
It‚Äôs not all bad, though ‚Ä?at least when it comes to the creative art that has been inspired by this nightmare of an election. One such example is ‚ÄúDillary Trumplon,‚Ä?a recently released rap song written and performed by Blaise Guerra that‚Äôs starting to go viral on social media. From Trump‚Äôs demagoguery to Hillary‚Äôs war mongering, Guerra leaves no stone unturned.
Listen to the song for yourself, then check out our interview with Blaise below (his responses have been slightly edited and condensed for clarity).
AM: What inspired you to make this song? Blaise: I was inspired to make the song because I felt very disenfranchised by the way Bernie Sanders sparked such an incredible movement but was completely ignored by the media and given no shot. Yet according to Election Justice USA , without the primaries being fixed, Sanders could have won by a landslide. I felt so cheated when he lost.

With the 2016 election campaign winding down, the Clinton campaign is ratcheting up demands for the FBI to publicly confirm the campaign‚Äôs allegations that Republican nominee Donald Trump is secretly in league with Russia. Sen. Harry Reid (D ‚Ä?NV) went so far as to claim the FBI has secret ‚Äúexplosive‚Ä?evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government that it is withholding. 
FBI officials familiar with their investigations into the allegations, which the Clinton campaign started publicizing around the Democratic National Convention, say they‚Äôve turned up nothing to connect Trump and Russia , leading FBI Director James Comey to decide against making any statements to that effect. 
The Clinton campaign has been making the allegations so long that they have taken to claiming ‚Äúeveryone knows‚Ä?that they are true, and appears unsettled by the FBI‚Äôs refusal to sign off on the claims simply because they haven‚Äôt been able to find real evidence corroborating the story. 
The Trump campaign has repeatedly denied ties to Russia, but that didn‚Äôt stop Clinton from calling Trump a ‚Äúpuppet‚Ä?of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the final presidential debate. The calls have grown since Friday‚Äôs FBI report to Congress about further Clinton emails being sought. 
With Clinton‚Äôs main campaign scandal growing in the waning weeks of the deal, some in her campaign have suggested that affirming Trump as secretly in league with the Russians would only be fair.

Aides to the Republican nominee told Fox News that Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee for the GOP and the campaign, held its most recent fundraiser on Oct. 19 and no more such events were scheduled. 
The move, which was first reported by The Washington Post, cuts off a key money source for Republicans hoping to keep hold of both houses of Congress.

By contrast, the Post reported that Democrat Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign has scheduled 41 fundraising events between now and Nov. 4. The former secretary of state was scheduled to make her last personal fundraising appearance Tuesday in Miami. 
Mnuchin told the paper that the real estate mogul was focusing on making his final pitch to the voters at a campaign events rather than raising money in the final two weeks of the race. 
‚ÄúWe have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political [events],‚Ä?Mnuchin said of the candidate. ‚ÄúUnlike Hillary, who has been fundraising and not out and about, he has constantly been out and about.‚Ä?
