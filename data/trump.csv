Since March of 2010, the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Act¡ªObamacare. This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don¡¯t work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. 
Congress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must: 
1. Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. 
2. Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. 
3. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn¡¯t Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.

Democrat Dr. Brenda Snipes was appointed by Jeb Bush in 2003 and is no stranger to controversy. On October 20, the Sun Sentinal reported that former Oakland Park Commissioner Anne Sallee noticed something troubling about her vote-by-mail ballot. It is missing Constitutional Amendment 2, the medical marijuana question. 
Sallee, now Broward chapter director of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, knows her way around government. Yet she said she spent a week unsuccessfully trying to get someone at the Broward elections office to pay attention to her complaint. 
She was cleared on Wednesday of another election snafu, the early posting of primary election results. Her office also was criticized for sending out inaccurate voter ID cards, and for printing ballots for November that include the word ¡°no¡± in the ¡°yes¡± line on the county¡¯s transportation sales surtax question.

And finally, this ridiculous and totally biased email was sent from University of Michigan President to the students offering them assistance to help them through the results of our Presidential election last night. The President wants to ensure the students that the university remains committed to their ¡°most important responsibility¡± at their school which is apparently, ¡°to remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty ¨C and to diversity, equity and inclusion.¡±: 
To All Members of the University Community: 
As I¡¯m sure many of you did, I watched the election coverage late into the night, and had the opportunity to visit with students and staff at a results-watching event sponsored by the Ginsberg Center at the Michigan Union. It will take quite some time to completely absorb the results from yesterday¡¯s election, understand the full implications, and discern the long-term impact on our university and our nation . More immediately, in the aftermath of a close and highly contentious election we continue to embrace our most important responsibility as a university community. Our responsibility is to remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty ¨C and to diversity, equity and inclusion. We are at our best when we come together to engage respectfully across our ideological differences; to support ALL who feel marginalized, threatened or unwelcome; and to pursue knowledge and understanding, as we always have, as the students, faculty and staff of the University of Michigan. There are reports of members of our community offering support to one another. Students are planning a vigil tonight on the Diag at 6 p.m. Our Center for Research on Teaching and Learning also has numerous resources available for faculty seeking help in cultivating classroom environments that are responsive to national issues. I also want to make everyone aware of some of the plans and events we have had in place for today and beyond. ¡¤ Our Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy is holding a Post-Election Analysis from 4 to 5:30 p.m. today in the Weill Hall¡¯s Annenberg Auditorium. Speakers include former U.S. Congressman John Dingell, former Ambassador Ron Weiser, and faculty members Mara Ostfeld, Betsey Stevenson and Marina Whitman. ¡¤ Our History Department has organized a community discussion led by faculty and students to include historical perspectives at 6 p.m. tonight in 1014 Tisch Hall. ¡¤ The Office of Student Life will provide resources and referrals for support on campus to students, faculty and staff at a location in the Michigan Union¡¯s Willis Ward Lounge. It will be open today from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. ¡¤ Our Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs is offering an open space of support to help members of our community connect during open hours today. MESA¡¯s office is in the Michigan Union, Room 2202. ¡¤ Tomorrow, our Ginsberg Center and Counseling and Psychological Services office is facilitating a Post-election Dialogue: Impact, Perspective-taking, and Moving Forward. This event is part of the Student Life Professional Development Conference at 1 ¨C 2 p.m. in the Michigan League¡¯s Henderson Room. I know that other schools, colleges and offices across our campus are planning events as well. I thank everyone who is helping us come together and ask anyone scheduling a post election event post it on the University of Michigan Events Calendar. I hope all of us will continue to proudly embrace the opportunities before us as the students, faculty and staff of a great public research university governed by the people. Elections are often times of great change, but the values we stand for at U-M have been shaped over the course of nearly 200 years. Our mission remains as essential for society as ever: ¡°¡­to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future.¡± I look forward to working together with all of you to advance the work we do in service of the public ¨C and to ensure that the University of Michigan will always be a welcoming place for all members of society.

MATH SHOWS Trump Would Have Beaten Obama In Romney-Obama Election ? 100percentfedUp.com,"Email For Republican politicians like Ohio Governor John Kasich who refused to get behind Donald J. Trump¡­it turns out Trump was right¡­he didn¡¯t need you. In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the ¡®never Trumpers¡¯ from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten him¡­ 
It¡¯s easy to glance at Tuesday¡¯s popular vote ¡ª which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 ¨C and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obama¡¯s 2012 totals in several Midwestern states ¡ª Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin ¡ª Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What¡¯s more, she far surpassed Obama¡¯s 2012 vote total in Florida, the country¡¯s biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. 
A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the country¡¯s most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation¡¯s most critical battleground states. Let¡¯s look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren¡¯t yet final because not all precincts have reported.

He and his family have already sacrificed so much because he chose to put his country first. Making sacrifices is certainly not something loudmouth liberals like Robert DeNiro are accustomed to. DeNiro was very vocal about his opposition to the wildly successful business man Donald J. Trump. He felt so strongly about his hate for Trump that made a video where he angrily stated he¡¯d like to, ¡°punch him in the face.¡± Now that Trump won the election in a landslide, DeNiro has chosen to get behind the Trump rioters who are terrorizing cities across America. Anti-Trump rioters are breaking windows, using baseball bats to smash the windshields of innocent citizens who get trapped in their hellish protests as they try to escape. Women who are taking part in the protests are being punched in the faces by men who are also taking part in the George Soros funded protests. American flags are being burned and families who are walking in major cities are being subjected to the most vile and disgusting, hateful language and images imaginable. If this is the kind of America that Robert DiNero is openly supporting? And if so, why would any American pay to see his movie,¡±Comedian¡±? 
Robert De Niro gave anti-Donald Trump protesters across the United States his backing Friday as he spoke about how ¡°depressed¡± the tycoon¡¯s win in the presidential election had made him. 
The 73-year-old star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film ¡°The Comedian¡± in Los Angeles when he was asked how he was coping with Trump¡¯s victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
¡°How am I doing? I¡¯m very depressed,¡± the famously laconic ¡°Raging Bull¡± actor told reporters. 
¡°We have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government.¡± 
Asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of Tuesday¡¯s election, he replied: ¡°Yes, absolutely. Things aren¡¯t being done right.¡± 
Demonstrators took to the streets in Miami, Los Angeles, New York and other US cities for a third straight night on Friday. 
In Manhattan, they held signs reading ¡°Your Wall Can¡¯t Stand in Our Way¡± ¡ª a reference to the anti-immigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the US border with Mexico. 
De Niro hasn¡¯t minced his words in his criticism of Trump, describing him as ¡°a punk,¡± ¡°a pig¡± and ¡°an idiot.¡± 
¡°I¡¯d like to punch him in the face,¡± he said before the election. 
Earlier in the day a town in southern Italy where De Niro¡¯s grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape. 
¡°If, after the disappointment of Trump, he wants to take refuge here, we are ready to welcome him,¡± said Antonio Cerio, the mayor of Ferrazzano.

Political activist and Hillary supporter Amal Clooney traveled to Texas to warn Americans about our elected President Donald J. Trump and his tough immigration policies.

It wasn¡¯t too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence, ¡°There will never be a President Trump¡±. 
Perhaps Amal should¡¯ve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation. Aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of American ranchers, and threatened the safety and security of American citizens living in homes in or near the US -Mexican border towns¡­ 
Amal Clooney has warned that many of president-elect Trump¡¯s proposals would be ¡®violations of international law.¡¯ 
Speaking at the Texas Conference For Women at the Austin Convention Center on Tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of George Clooney, said she had concerns about America¡¯s reputation under the real estate mogul¡¯s plans. 
She noted that Trump¡¯s comments during his campaign, ¡®that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the U.S. or the fact that there should be state-sponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed ¡ª all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that.¡¯ 
The 38-year-old wife said America¡¯s reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. 
¡®I think there¡¯s some concern from abroad as to, ¡°Are these things actually going to happen?¡±, or is the U.S. going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally,¡¯ according to the Hollywood Reporter. 
Perhaps its time to put our nation¡¯s security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us¡­ 
Both Amal and her Hollywood actor husband George, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, have spoken out against Trump in the past. 
Earlier this year, Amal Clooney called for Trump to be challenged on his extreme views. 
Watch George Clooney here whine about press giving Trump too much favorable press: 
¡®When you listen to what the leading candidate on the Republican side has been saying about building walls, about excluding Mexicans and a complete shutdown of all Muslims entering in, and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying, ¡®They only want jihad.

They had to know they had it coming¡­ 
Donald Trump scolded media big shots during an off-the-record Trump Tower sitdown on Monday, sources told The Post. 
¡°It was like a f¨Cing firing squad,¡± one source said of the encounter. 
¡°Trump started with [CNN chief] Jeff Zucker and said ¡®I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed,¡¯ ¡± the source said. 
¡°The meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down,¡± the source added. 
A second source confirmed the fireworks. 
¡°The meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks,¡± the other source said. 
¡°Trump kept saying, ¡®We¡¯re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong.¡¯ He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was [a] network of liars,¡± the source said. 
¡°Trump didn¡¯t say [NBC reporter] Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate ¨C which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room.¡± 
The stunned reporters tried to get a word in edgewise to discuss access to a Trump Administration. 
¡°[CBS Good Morning co-host Gayle] King did not stand up, but asked some question, ¡®How do you propose we the media work with you?¡¯ Chuck Todd asked some pretty pointed questions. David Muir asked ¡®How are you going to cope living in DC while your family is in NYC? It was a horrible meeting.¡± 
Here¡¯s a sampling of Trump hitting back at the dishonest media while he was on the campaign trail. Trump did something no other presidential candidate has ever done before, he won the election in a landslide, in spite of the entire fake news empire working together to take him down: 
Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway told reporters the gathering went well. 
¡°Excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks,¡± she said during a gaggle in the lobby of Trump Tower. ¡°Pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.¡±

21st Century Wire says¡­ 
Yesterday, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange confirmed what 21WIRE already knew ¨C that Hillary Clinton and the Obama White House¡¯s claim of the US election process being ¡°hacked by the Russian government¡± was a desperate work of fiction. Not content with that fish tale, Hillary Clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low (if that was even possible) with another, wilder made-up conspiracy story about the Russians. 
The following statement made by Hillary Clinton yesterday epitomizes the term ¡° jumping the shark ¡°: It's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia. https://t.co/D8oSmyVAR4 pic.twitter.com/07dRyEmPjX 
¡ª Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016 
Apparently, Hillary Clinton¡¯s campaign staff fed her a planted online news story (by the Clinton campaign?) which ran on a questionable pro-Democratic Party online news outlet. On Monday, the Slate ran the story by one of its alleged ¡°journalists¡± named Franklin Foer , complete with a clickbait blog-like headline, ¡°Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?¡± 
Whatever legitimacy the Slate had before last night, just evaporated. 
John Roberts from Forbes explains, ¡°The bottom line is that Slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place, and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season. As for Foer, he says on Twitter a ¡°follow up¡± piece is in the works.¡± 
Roberts rightly points out that the only follow-up story for this lemon should start with the word ¡°RETRACTION.¡± 
CYBER FEUD: Assange believes Clinton has gone beyond the pale with her Russian conspiracy obsession. 
During his exclusive interview with award-winning filmmaker John Pilger, when asked what he thought of Hillary Clinton¡¯s shrill antics, Julian Assange said, ¡° ¡°I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick.¡± 
The saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party ¨C is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty. Like Hillary Clinton in her sociopathic path to power, the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess. 
Still, Clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate Clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower ¨C with a decade-old misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of Donald Trump in a TMZ-style tabloid sting. That pretty much sums up Democratic Party strategy for this election season. 
Assange was right. Clinton, the Democratic Party and their surrogate, are eating themselves. Such are the spoils of power in Washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it.

21st Century Wire says¡­ 
Over the past months, Hillary Clinton, the Obama White House and the mainstream media have been promoting the conspiracy theory that ¡° Russia is Hacking the US Election ¡±¨C blaming Moscow for the WikiLeaks emails, the DNC Leaks and for allegedly ¡®hacking¡¯ US voting systems. Despite the grand accusations, no evidence or proof has been offered by the US government. 
It goes without saying how damaging the Democratic Party¡¯s crazed witch hunt has been to US-Russian relations, where Clinton has led the anti-Russian crusade, and demonizing president Vladimir Putin at every opportunity. 
Today¡¯s stunning presidential victory by Donald Trump means that all eyes are now on Putin to see how Moscow and Washington will be interfacing going forward. 
With such sensitive geopolitical issues like Syria and the Ukraine currently in play, what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward¡­ 
In a message to Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each other¡¯s views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US. 
Putin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing Russian-American relations out of their current crisis. 
The Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some ¡°burning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,¡± RIA Novosti reported. 
On top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that ¡°building a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other¡¯s positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.¡± 
According to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russia¡¯s relations with the US ¡°was not our choice,¡± however. 
For things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russia¡¯s interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month. 
¡°We are concerned with the deterioration of Russian-American relations, but that was not our choice, we never wanted that. On the contrary, we want to have friendly relations with the US, a great country and a leading economy,¡± Putin said at an economic forum in Moscow¡­

Organized efforts are underway by Democratic Party affiliated NGO¡¯s to try and somehow delegitimize the results of this week¡¯s US Presidential Election. 
On the eve of the US Election before voters went to the polls, 21WIRE political affairs analyst Patrick Henningsen accurately predicted this week¡¯s unrest when he said : 
¡°If Trump wins, expect the likes of Soros and MoveOn.org to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs, who will protest, riot, smash and burn their way on to CNN¡¯s 24 hour news rotation. Expect Occupy 2.0, and #BlackLivesMatter to rage.¡± 
On Friday, Henningsen talked to RT International about the post-elections protests that were coordinated in part by Democratic Party ¡®community organizing¡¯ online platform MoveOn.org . Watch: 
. Not surprisingly, MoveOn.org have also launched a national ¡®activist¡¯ campaign to ¡° Abolish the Electoral College ¡± after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton came up short with 232 (including New Hampshire) to Donald Trump¡¯s 306 (including Arizona and Michigan).

21WIRE Associate Editor Shawn Helton recently revealed more details about how the near exact same methods used in CIA and Soros-funded ¡®color revolutions¡¯ overseas ¨C are now being deployed on US domestic shores by similar NGO front organizations: has been the driving force behind nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump. 
¡°Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State. Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org, as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO , and UNITE HERE . These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this week¡¯s protests,¡± says Helton. 
Helton also raised the question as to why President Obama has stayed silent in the face of street protests, opting instead to ¡°lead from behind.¡± He explains: 
¡°Certainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clinton¡¯s total silence over their own party¡¯s role in fomenting this week¡¯s unrest ¨C one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots.

J.R. Smith 21st Century Wire 
The election campaign might be over, but the mainstream media¡¯s campaign against President Elect Donald Trump is in full swing. 
Between all of the fake polling, intentionally pro-Clinton partisan coverage, and mainstream media collusion with the Democratic National Party and the Clinton Campaign exposed through WikiLeaks¡¯ Podesta email dump ¨C nearly the entire US mainstream media is now in full damage-limitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left. 
It¡¯s now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts, as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence, while promoting unfounded fears ¨C and all the while pushing fictional ¡®hate crime¡¯ hoaxes. 
CBS News flagship investigative program 60 Minutes conducted a recorded interview with Trump on Friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to ¡°Stop it,¡± in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public, or at schools. In light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked America since the election results were announced last week, it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by Trump, but instead mainstream CBS buried it for 3 days until 60 Minutes was scheduled to air later on Sunday evening nationwide. If CBS had any credibility remaining, this certainly will have finished it off. 
When told about alleged reports of a ¡®Trump supporter¡¯ who were said to have been harassing Latinos and Muslims following his presidential win, Trump told interviewer Leslie Stahl , ¡°I am so saddened to hear that.¡± He then added, ¡°And I say, ¡®Stop it.¡¯ If it helps, I will say this ¨C and I will say right to the cameras: ¡®Stop it.'¡± 
One big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did Stahl give any specifics on these alleged ¡°abuses¡± by Trump supporters against Muslims and Latinos, and even though it¡¯s obvious that Trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses ¨C Stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf ¨C without offering any evidence to support her claim. This was ¡®drive-by¡¯ media at its worst. In fact, not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media, and some may end up actually being media-generated rumors, or even hoaxes. 
Now, it¡¯s perfectly understandable that Trump¡¯s victory over the establishment¡¯s heavily inflated candidate Hillary Clinton has left many Democrats, especially millennial college-aged students upset, angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos (they are not upset that Trump won, as much as they are upset that ¡®they¡¯ lost). The real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of America¡¯s politically correct-obsessed young adults. The real danger is that Democratic Party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging, and fabricating ¡°hate crime¡± incidents in order to propagate the idea that the President Elect and his supporters are somehow ¡°causing many minorities fearful about the future¡±. In reality, much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets. 
In fact, one Muslim female from Louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged ¡®hate crime¡¯ incident ¨C one designed to discredit Trump, and to help stoke more nationwide protests. 
Buzzfeed reported, via Religion of Peace : 
A woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, including one wearing a Donald Trump hat, made up the story, police said in a statement. 
The woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab, a scarf sometimes worn by Muslim women, The Advertiser reported. 
Lafayette Police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation, the paper reported. 
¡°During the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males,¡± the statement reportedly read. 
NOTE: This story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of self-described ¡°journalists¡± who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of America¡¯s corrupt liberal mainstream media. 
That¡¯s right ¨C this was just another hoax: 
Violent Democratic-Affiliated Street Gangs 
What Leslie Stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at CBS and 60 Minutes have obscured is the fact since Tuesday¡¯s election, nearly all of the so-called ¡®violent hate crimes¡¯ have been carried out against Trump supporters ¨C by street gangs who are most clearly Democrat Party supporters. 
Here are just a few examples: @michellemalkin Even high school kids are not spared. Student Trump supporter attacked at Woodside High School https://t.co/e7tVvDJ6O8

Watch this clip taken from the radical leftist Portland protests this weekend, where Democratic Party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a ¡®Trump supporter.¡¯ These violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the Democratic Party and the sitting President of the United States, Barack Obama ¨C are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the Democratic Party¡¯s online ¡®community organizer¡¯ network MoveOn.org ¨C a digital platform partly funded by leading Clinton donor and billionaire George Soros . Watch this stunning clip: 
. Here is a video of clip of a white male in Chicago, 49 yr old David Wilcox, who was driving and scraped another vehicle. When the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information, Wilcox was greeted by a gang of African-Americans, presumably Democratic Party supporters, who began pointing and shouting, ¡°You voted for Donald Trump!¡± before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street. Wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight. He was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital. 
From reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did Wilcox display any support for Donald Trump. It appears as if they attacked him because he was white. So could one call this a case of black on white racism? Regardless, it¡¯s political intimidation done on the street ¨C which could also be defined as pure political fascism. In this instance, the violence was partisan, and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial Democrat foot soldiers ¨C enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of America. Watch this disturbing video: . Agitator and Chief: Where is Obama? 
These incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national US media who are obviously still working to discredit the Trump Presidency. 
Amidst all this violence, however, where is the current President Obama, or the Democratic Party¡¯s losing candidate Hillary Clinton ¨C to help calm street thugs and violent ¡®progressives¡¯? It¡¯s almost as if Obama and Clinton are enjoying the unrest. Most certainly though, Obama, Clinton and the Democratic Party are hoping to use this week¡¯s media-generated liberal angst as future political leverage. 
What used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program, 60 minutes, has gradually become a joke. It seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest, opting instead for running bland People Magazine and Time Magazine-style ¡®safe¡¯ segments. Judging by its plummeting ratings, and its predictable cast of ¡®job for life¡¯ government-approved media gatekeeper-cum-commentators like Anderson Cooper and Lesley Stahl, there is little hope for this institution. You might even say it¡¯s irredeemable . 
One of the corporate mainstream¡¯s worst offenders during the election was CNN host Brian Stelter (photo, left), whose own show is ironically titled ¡°Reliable Sources.¡± Stelter is meant to be CNN¡¯s media watchdog person, laughably given the lofty title as ¡°senior media analyst.¡± After leading CNN¡¯s own exposed efforts to obscure and derail Trump¡¯s Presidential run, while working to cover for a hugely unpopular (even among Democrats) Hillary Clinton candidacy, Stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his network¡¯s horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of US elections. But it¡¯s too late. The damage has already been done, and CNN will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain. They are a dirty media outlet, and now everyone knows it. 
Now CBS News has been exposed in public view, but their crime is even worse than CNN¡¯s which was just dirty politics in comparison. CBS News took it upon itself to compromise public safety, and put lives at risk ¨C all for its own selfish institutional political position. Twenty years ago, this might have been considered shameful, but in today¡¯s toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses ¨C they are all way past shameless at this stage. 
None of them can be trusted anymore ¨C only tolerated, in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years.

Not all protests have been peaceful. A protester was shot in Portland last Thursday and hospitalized. Hundreds of arrests have been made, property has been damaged and traffic has snarled due to roads being blocked by protesters chanting ¡°Impeach Trump¡± and ¡°Not my president.¡±¡­

William McGurn Wall Street Journal 
Let¡¯s get this straight. Calling Hillary Clinton a ¡°bigot¡± has reporters asking every Republican in sight if Donald Trump has gone too far. But the Clinton campaign releases a video saying Mr. Trump is the candidate of the Ku Klux Klan, and it¡¯s all okey-dokey? 
Then again, Mr. Trump has already been likened to Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. Small wonder there¡¯s a collective ho-hum when Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says Mr. Trump is peddling ¡°KKK values.¡± 
This is what Democrats do. It didn¡¯t start with Mr. Trump, either. For years Democrats have portrayed the GOP as one giant hate group. 
Each presidential election, the drill goes like this: 
After Republicans nominate someone, he immediately finds himself having to prove he¡¯s not a hater ¨C of African-Americans, of women, of gays, etc. 
This year Democrats added a twist. Mr. Trump, they claim, represents a break with all those decent and lovable Republicans such as Mitt Romney , John McCain and George W. Bush . Of course, this isn¡¯t what they were saying back when these men were running for president. 
? In 2000, for example, an NAACP ad recreated the gruesome murder of James Byrd to imply that then-Gov. Bush was sympathetic to lynching black men. Over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck, Mr. Byrd¡¯s daughter says, ¡°So when Gov. George W. Bush refused to support hate-crimes legislation, it was like my father was killed all over again.¡± 
? When John McCain ran in 2008, Barack Obama warned that Republicans would scare people by saying, ¡°You know, he doesn¡¯t look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.¡± The McCain campaign fired back, accusing Mr. Obama of playing the race card from the ¡°bottom of the deck.¡± Funny thing: All those reporters always hearing ¡°dog whistles¡± from Republicans somehow didn¡¯t hear this one. 
? In 2012, when Mitt Romney went to the NAACP and told them face-to-face about his opposition to ObamaCare, the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote. Vice President Joe Biden put it more explicitly, telling a largely African-American audience that if Mr. Romney were to win, he¡¯d ¡°put ya¡¯ll back in chains.¡± 
The only difference today is that Republicans now have a nominee giving as good as he gets¡­",english,2016-11-23T01:36:58.899+02:00,21stcenturywire.com,US,,FLASHBACK - Hillary Clinton¡¯s ¡®KKK¡¯ Smear Against Trump was Democrat Strategy,0,http://i2.wp.com/21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-Clinton-KKK-Democratic-Party.jpg?fit=610%2C415,0,1,0,0,0,conspiracy,Negative

(AP Photo / Dennis System) 
COLUMBUS, OH (AP) ¡ª History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November. 
The organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee. 
The Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they don¡¯t vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process. 
¡°Over the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,¡± said AAB chairman Menno Simons. ¡°We have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage. Now, they want to put a woman in the nation¡¯s highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 Timothy 2:12. We need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lord¡¯s way.¡± 
According to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote. 
¡°The Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,¡± Silver noted. ¡°They also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.¡± 
The Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision. 
¡°I don¡¯t believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,¡± Clinton wrote to the AAB. ¡°As a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.¡± 
Most pundits believe that Mrs. Clinton¡¯s plea is too little too late. 
During a press conference in Manhattan, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because ¡°the Amish do great work for a very low price.¡± 
Though Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff over the next two weeks. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses. 
¡°It looked like she was going to win this election easily,¡± said Paul Horner, a campaign worker in Ohio, ¡°But this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Cleary, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. It¡¯s really sad to see the campaign end this way.¡±

The FBI was investigating Anthony Weiner and Kim Dotcom when they found the Israeli pay to play emails on Weiner's computer. It's very serious. The FBI will be charging Hillary Clinton with planning to engage in pay to play after she had won the election. It's technically treason. Weiner was bragging that he had set up the Israeli deal. HRC was to get $100 million for the Clinton Foundation, for increasing Israeli aid by double! That's $38 billion more than today! Huma Abedin helped set the deal up.

Basically, they have trouble thinking of how others perceive their actions. These people tend to be highly intelligent. Trump's IQ is 156, which makes sense considering he has built more businesses than most of us have, and although he could have invested his father's money and made the same amount back as he did in the end through business deals, he put a lot of work and thought into his business. I would like to know what kind of medicines Trump is on and what his mental health diagnosis are. If he has Aspergers, then that would explain why he makes so many social mistakes. Being super rich from a young age might also account for it since he would not be trained to interact with people on an equal level (which is a lot more complicated than interacting with people when you are rich and they are poor). However, an article in The New York Times recently focused on Trump's fears of making social blunders. He has a fear of losing social status or being embarrassed publicly. However, he doesn't seem to do well publicly, which must be a disability because he would *want* to be a good public speaker and not make social gaffes yet he still does it. It must be accidental.

Conservatives claim that voter ID is necessary to catch illegal voters, but it turns out they¡¯re the only ones creating fake IDs to use on Election Day. 
Trump supporters are taking Trump¡¯s call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake ID badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them, confusing them, and filming them ¡ª all of which are illegal. 
But, Trump¡¯s deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a right-wing group known as ¡°Vote Protectors.¡± 
The group, which is affiliated with top Trump ally Roger Stone, is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on Election Day. They are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes. 
According to the Huffington Post , 
Stone¡¯s group created an official-looking ID badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake ¡°exit polls,¡± efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. Or at least that¡¯s what the group was planning to do before The Huffington Post asked Stone about it on Tuesday. The controversial Trump ally, long known for his bare-knuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his group¡¯s websites were there without his knowledge, and assured HuffPost that he would operate within the confines of election law. 
In fact, after HuffPo confronted Stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that Vote Protectors had a ¡°bad idea¡± and ¡°ordered them taken down.¡± 
Campaign Legal Center deputy director Danielle Lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. 
¡°It¡¯s inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy,¡± she told HuffPo in reference to the videotaping. ¡°When that¡¯s being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. Objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it.¡± 
Indeed, but that¡¯s exactly what Donald Trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him. 
As it turns out, he¡¯s right about the election being rigged, only it¡¯s conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of Trump. 
Earlier this week, a Wisconsin city clerk in Green Bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she has merely heard that students lean Democrat. 
¡°I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,¡± Republican appointed clerk Kris Teske wrote. 
¡°UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn¡¯t going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats.¡± 
So not only are Trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well. 
And that is likely going to cause a lot of Election Day chaos. Voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what Trump¡¯s deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it.

One thing that has continuously dogged the Donald Trump for president campaign is the fact that racists, anti-semites, xenophobes, misogynists, and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign. No matter how much Trump¡¯s people try to say he doesn¡¯t want the support of such folks, the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously. So, naturally, when Trump¡¯s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sat down with an interview with CNN¡¯s Jake Tapper on Sunday , that particular issue came up again. Of course, Conway was not happy. Tapper began: 
¡°There are a lot of anti-Semites and racists and misogynists who support the Trump candidacy.¡± 
Conway immediately went on defense, saying, ¡°wow.¡± Tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting ¡®JEW-S-A¡¯ at the press pen at a recent Trump rally, and directly asked Conway if she would refer to such people as ¡®deplorable.¡¯ She responded: 
¡°Yes, I would. Wow, I have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe ¡ª I hope you¡¯ve been to Trump rallies and I hope that you¡¯ve seen the tens of thousands. I mean, he¡¯s had over half a million people easily, I think in excess of that. These are U.S.A.-loving Americans.¡± 
Tapper went on to say that no, he isn¡¯t putting all Trump supporters into that camp, but went on to force Conway¡¯s hand on this one: 
¡°But without question, people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic and racists and on and on. And these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting Mr. Trump. 
Mr. Trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and anti-Semitic fans,¡± Tapper continued. ¡°He just has. He says things like, ¡°Oh, sure, I disavow, I disavow.¡¯ But he has never serious said, ¡®I don¡¯t want the support of those people, they are reprehensible, they have nothing to do with me.¡¯ He has never seriously done it.¡± 
Conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the Trump campaign is winning, saying: 
¡°I think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence I have that we¡¯re actually going to win in nine days because the idea that we¡¯re going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that Hillary Clinton would bring to the Oval Office in such an important week.¡± 
No, Kellyanne, it¡¯s not a sign that Trump is winning. It¡¯s pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began: That Donald Trump is a raging bigot, and he has been so openly. Dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle, and it¡¯s all because of Donald Trump. He embraces these bigots because he¡¯s one of them. The quicker you learn that, the better.

Donald Trump¡¯s deplorable supporters aren¡¯t waiting for the election results to start spilling blood. 
They¡¯ve been threatening bloody violence ever since Trump began claiming that the election is ¡°rigged¡± in favor of Hillary Clinton. And Trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places. 
In Texas last week, a Trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of Trump¡¯s stupid hats and a ¡°Deplorables¡± T-shirt to vote. 
Election code prohibits any person from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. 
Of course, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules don¡¯t apply to them. 
Well, now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped Trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down. 
At Collin College in Plano, Texas a Trump sign was discovered zip-tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places. 
But when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside. The blades sliced into the volunteer¡¯s hands and drew blood, requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal. 
¡°It just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody who¡¯s probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other,¡± local Democratic Party campaign chair Steve Spainhouer said in response . ¡°I think most people have already made their minds up at this point how they¡¯re going to vote and so there¡¯s nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful.¡± 
Here¡¯s the video via KTVT . 
Frankly, this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism. Trump¡¯s supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as Election Day approaches. And if Trump loses, his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup. 
Clearly, these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger. But you won¡¯t hear Donald Trump condemning this act of violence. After all, he is the one inciting it.

New video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, Fred Trump, young Donald Trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants. 
As part of an investigation by NBC News, Stanley Leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the Trump Organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder Trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties. 
In the interview, Leibowitz said that Trump told him ¡°I don¡¯t rent to the n-word,¡± and indicates that Trump made this statement with Donald Trump in the room and that the younger Trump affirmed the policy. 
The revelation comes at the same time that the Clinton campaign has released a video highlighting Trump¡¯s run-in with the federal government over discrimination. 
Undercover investigators were sent to Trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties. 
One bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a ¡°C¡± on the documents for ¡°colored,¡± and that was a sign that they should be denied. 
The Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. 
Donald Trump¡¯s involvement with his father¡¯s business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his father¡¯s $14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business. But if you accept that, the Trump Organization¡¯s history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away ¨C it¡¯s still there.

We¡¯ve all seen pictures of the Trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor, complete with their young son Barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents. It¡¯s a life most of us can never imagine while we¡¯re paying our monthly bills. So what¡¯s it like growing up with Donald Trump as a father? According to Scott Melker, a former classmate of Donald Trump Jr.¡¯s, at the University of Pennsylvania, being the former reality show star¡¯s son wasn¡¯t what one might imagine. Or, given Trump¡¯s temperament, it might be exactly what you¡¯d imagine. 
On Facebook , Mekler told of the animosity Trump¡¯s son had for this father. 
¡°I was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends, next door to Donald Jr.¡¯s room. I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his son¡¯s door, there to pick him up for a baseball game,¡± he recalls. ¡°There were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey.¡± 
Then Mekler told of the moment Trump slapped his son in the face in front of others. 
¡°Without saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said ¡°put on a suit and meet me outside,¡± and closed the door,¡± Melker wrote. 
¡°Donald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking,¡± he continued. ¡°He absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. His nickname was ¡°Diaper Don,¡± because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other people¡¯s beds and urinate.¡± ¡°I always felt terrible for him,¡± he continued. 
Mekler said part of his reason for voting for Hillary Clinton is because ¡°in light of what I saw that day, it is clear to me that Donald Trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country.¡± 
To be clear, we are not demonizing Trump¡¯s son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days. Whether Melker¡¯s story is accurate or not, we¡¯re not sure, but given Trump¡¯s awful temper, it¡¯s difficult to discount it.

GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has taken a ridiculously hardline ¨C and even bigoted ¨C stance on immigration. He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect ¡°deportation forces¡± to root out and get rid of all people in the United States without proper documentation. Well, as we already knew, it turns out that The Donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one. 
According to the Associated Press , it turns out that Donald Trump¡¯s wife Melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the United States when she first arrived from her native Slovenia. Melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitor¡¯s visa, known as a B1/B2 visa. This occurred on August 27, 1996. Melania did not get a legal work visa until October 18, 1996. During the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, Melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of $20,000. She got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006. 
So, in other words, Melania Trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as Thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. Melania said, in part, in her stump speech: 
¡°As a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here. Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American.¡± 
Well, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that Melania Trump wasn¡¯t as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. The information obtained by the AP include, but are not limited to, her contract from Metropolitan International Management ¨C a modeling agency. Also, there¡¯s the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows Melania working during the time when she had the visitor¡¯s visa, but no work visa. It seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up Melania¡¯s wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. This would be why Melania Trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the United States and her eventual path to citizenship. While it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. You can read more here at the Associated Press . 
The long and short of it is this: Donald Trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the ¡°other.¡± Namely, immigrants. That is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didn¡¯t completely comply with immigration law. Hopefully this story, and the many other lies and cover-ups and shady dealings surrounding the Trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time.

If you had wanted to give Trump supporters the benefit of the doubt, this most recent incident proves that it¡¯s far too much to give them. 
A 56-year-old man in Allen Park, Michigan has just been charged with six felonies after he held six children at gunpoint because he thought they¡¯d damaged the Donald Trump sign on his lawn. Yes, this is the kind of deranged, emotionally unstable supporters Trump has attracted. 
The man, Michael Robert Kubek, had called police on October 29th to report that his Trump sign had been hit by teenagers, who had fled the scene. When the police arrived at the scene, they didn¡¯t find Kubek at his home ¨C however, when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner, there he was. 
The police saw Kubek standing over six children ages 12-14, who were sitting on the grass. Kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it. The children denied any involvement, and the officers told Kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children. 
According to the kids, they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when Kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them, instructing them to sit down on the grass. Those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock: Twitter Twitter 
The News-Herald reported: 
¡°The officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign, but Kubek repeated that he could not. The officer then asked Kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids. According to police, Kubek said ¡°yes.¡± 
In response to another question from the officer, Kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered.¡± 
Yes, a grown man used a gun because he felt ¡°outnumbered¡± by a small group of innocent kids. This is EXACTLY the type of unhinged person who shouldn¡¯t be trusted with firearms! Kubek¡¯s hearing is scheduled for December 5th ¨C let¡¯s hope that whatever happens to Kubek, that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner. You can watch a report below:

Trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isn¡¯t hard. Getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that Trump is the liar of liars is. Same thing with bullying, but The New York Times put together a spread of all the bullyish things Trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. Now, the Toronto Star ¡®s Daniel Dale has been tracking Trump¡¯s lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here . 
There are literally hundreds of lies in Trump¡¯s speeches. They¡¯re not all 100% unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that Trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy. 
Is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? Tons of people claim Hillary is a master liar, but first, she¡¯s actually more honest than most politicians. Second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with Trump the Liar in any way, shape or form. 
The Star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories: Clinton¡¯s policies, WTF, Daesh/Middle East, Clinton¡¯s record, African Americans/Inner cities, The Clintons¡¯ corruption, Rigged election, Trade/Economy, Health care, Trump¡¯s endorsements, Refugees/Immigration, Polls, Obama¡¯s record, The campaign, Russia, Trump¡¯s record, Taxes, Sex assault allegations, Clinton¡¯s health and Government corruption. 
They also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies Trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with, ¡°The electoral system is rigged.¡± Of course, it¡¯s rigged against him: 
¡°After plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, Trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election. ¡®Rigged¡¯ became his catchword. 
He claimed Hillary Clinton campaign workers hired ¡®thugs¡¯ to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage Clinton. He claimed there was widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis ¡ª cities with large black populations that heavily favour Democrats. 
In Greeley, Colo., Trump told his supporters if they don¡¯t trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. So, one did. Trump supporter Terri Lynn Rote, a 55-year-old from Iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice.¡± 
Nobody¡¯s committing voter suppression and fraud quite like Trumpsters and Republicans. 
Another is, ¡°Muslims are risky.¡± This touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from Syria, who could be the great Trojan Horse of our time: 
¡°His claims that Syrian refugees ¡ª 99 per cent are Muslim ¡ª are terrorists plays to the fears of the ¡°other,¡± even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. And their numbers is nowhere near Trump¡¯s claims ¡ª about 13,000 have been admitted to the United States in 2016.¡± 
¡°The polls favour Trump.¡± Har de har har ¨C Trump only looks at the polls he likes, and they¡¯re usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. Very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. Nevertheless: 
¡°It seems clear Trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. This ¡®poll denialism¡¯ gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests CNN. 
His false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling ¡ª and perhaps even the vote itself. If supporters feel Trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible. 
On Oct. 24, he said ¡®I won the last two debates, and every poll showed it.¡¯ In fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost. 
Of course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, Trump was quick to promote ¡ª and exaggerate ¡ª those numbers.¡± 
But these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. He has also: Falsely said on Twitter, ¡°The failing NYTimes reporters don¡¯t even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way!¡± Falsely said, ¡°By ¡®open borders,¡¯ [Hillary] means totally unlimited immigration.¡± Falsely said, ¡°Hillary¡¯s plan includes an open border with the Middle East.¡± Falsely called NBC anchor Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, ¡°a Democrat.¡± Falsely said, ¡°Wow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible.¡± Falsely said the U.S. provided Iran ¡°$150 billion¡± as part of the nuclear deal. Falsely said, ¡°In San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people¡­Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.¡± Falsely asserted that Clinton has ¡°been fighting ISIS (her) entire adult life.¡± Falsely said, ¡°All together, the Hillary Clinton plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term.¡± Falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring NATO ¡°obsolete because it doesn¡¯t cover terror;¡± falsely suggested NATO created an anti-terror position because of his comments. Falsely claimed Clinton didn¡¯t release cholesterol or EKG information Falsely said sexual assault allegations against him ¡°have been largely debunked.¡± Falsely said, apparently of sexual assault accuser Summer Zervos, ¡°The one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense.¡± Falsely said ¡°I did not. I did not¡± to Clinton¡¯s charge that he thinks Climate change is a ¡°hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.¡± Falsely said, ¡°I was against going into Iraq. And it¡¯s so well-documented.¡± Falsely said, ¡°Our taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world.¡± 
And so many more, just in the last six weeks! Yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. If Trump sees this, he¡¯ll likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the paper¡¯s lying, and continue to sell the myth that he¡¯s not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies.

As if the election of Donald Trump couldn¡¯t get even more disastrous and hypocritical, Senator Lindsey Graham just called on Trump to nominate a right-wing extremist to nation¡¯s highest court. 
All year long, Republicans have been blocking President Obama¡¯s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court because they want the next president to make the pick. And because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted, they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist. 
South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told WYFF-TV that Trump should pick Texas Senator Ted Cruz as the nominee and warned Democrats not to block him, which is hypocritical considering how Republicans have treated President Obama¡¯s nominee and threatened to block any nominees Hillary Clinton would have made had she won the election. 
¡°I¡¯m here to tell my Democratic colleagues that I voted for Obama¡¯s nominees. I expect them to give Trump¡¯s nominees a fair shake. He won this election. He will pick a conservative. I would put Ted Cruz on that list. If they try to block this pick, they will regret it. If you don¡¯t honor Trump¡¯s nominee, you¡¯re making a huge mistake.¡± 
Democrats should stand up and give Graham a collective middle finger. 
Since Antonin Scalia died in February, there has been a vacancy on the Supreme Court bench that has yet to be filled. The body wasn¡¯t even cold yet before Republicans vowed to block any nominee President Obama picked to replace him, going so far as to even deny Garland a confirmation hearing. That¡¯s far from the ¡°fair shake¡± Graham is asking Democrats to give to a man as dangerous as Ted Cruz. 
Putting Cruz on the Supreme Court would guarantee rulings against women¡¯s rights and LGBT rights as well as putting laws like the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act in further peril. In no uncertain terms should Democrats grant Cruz a hearing, nor should they respect any of Trump¡¯s conservative choices for the court. Republicans should have thought about ¡°fair shakes¡± before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the Supreme Court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than Trump. Again, Senate Republicans didn¡¯t even give Garland a hearing or a vote. They refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards President Obama. And so that¡¯s exactly what Democrats should do to Trump. Turnabout is fair play and Republicans only have themselves to blame.

Post election, the media and Donald Trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. They are making the claim that Trump wasn¡¯t elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that it¡¯s simply not true. Trump voters are racist and there¡¯s proof. 
The American National Elections Study (ANES) began the study in January. Initially, they asked ¡°How likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.¡± Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. It¡¯s VERY unlikely that whites aren¡¯t getting jobs because minorities are, but that¡¯s not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that it¡¯s ¡°extremely likely¡± that minorities are taking jobs from white people. Graph courtesy of ANES and Salon . 
Then, they asked the same Trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. Despite the fact that trade was one of Trump¡¯s signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed. 
Post election, this is what the study found: 
The question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is ¡°extremely likely¡± that whites can¡¯t find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is ¡°not at all¡± likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eighty-one percent of white women who think it is ¡°extremely likely¡± people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who don¡¯t think that. 
More than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are ¡°violent.¡± 84 percent think that of Muslims. 
Unfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this: 
Democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As I¡¯ve shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation. 
Great idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots¡¯ claims go unchallenged.

Before the leaked tape of Donald Trump describing his propensity to grab women ¡°by the pussy¡± to Billy Bush, it seemed that the media was ignoring Donald Trump¡¯s glaring faults as a presidential candidate. During the primaries , for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. It turns out there might be a reason for that ¨C Trump was bribing the media ¨C at least that¡¯s the accusation being made by Megyn Kelly of Fox News. 
In her memoire ¡°Settle for More,¡± which will be released this week, Kelly said that Trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women ¡°fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.¡± That question set Trump off on one of his Twitter tirades. These are only a portion: 
The worst and most controversial of which was this: 
As the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that Trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. If they didn¡¯t, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery. 
While Kelly couldn¡¯t speak for other members of the media, she alleges that Trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. While the attempt clearly didn¡¯t work on Kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. 
¡°This is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign: I was not the only journalist to whom Trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage,¡± Kelly said. He also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding, ¡°This is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking.¡± 
¡°Trump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded,¡± she said. 
When it became obvious that some reporters were ¡°in the tank¡± for Trump, she alleges in one chapter, ¡°certain TV hosts¡± would work with the candidate in advance on occasional Trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. She didn¡¯t identify them by name or media outlet. 
Source: Yahoo 
Kelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which Kelly asked about Trump¡¯s treatment of women, the candidate called Fox News exec. Bill Sammon, who told him about the first question. All we heard about, though, during the election, was that it was Hillary Clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering. The insider knowledge said that a woman, in the Flint, Michigan debate, would ask a question about the Flint water . 
While bribing journalists isn¡¯t illegal, per say, it is highly unethical. Without the Fourth Estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics, democracy is impossible.

Here¡¯s the original clip of President Lisa Simpson calling out a Donald Trump presidency for his fiscal fallout and bad economy: 
Early on into Trump¡¯s campaign, The Simpsons satirized the reality TV host turned president-elect by having Homer Simpson somehow at the campaign rollout and falling into Trump¡¯s hair. If we could only go back to that moment and enjoy the comedy over reality. 
Now we have to reap what we¡¯ve sown, or rather what the less than half of voting Americans have sown considering Trump only won with the Electoral College and lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in his own words, big league. 
Most of us with The Simpsons were very wrong with the prediction as well.

It was just a few days ago that Bernie Sanders responded to Trump¡¯s election win with the perfect message from Democrats. He said : 
¡°If Donald Trump takes people¡¯s anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare.¡± 
And from what was just announced, it seems that Sanders has every intention of making good on that warning. Earlier today, the Vermont Senator was named chair of outreach during a closed-door Senate Democrat caucus meeting, according to The Hill . In his new role, Sanders will lead outreach to blue-collar voters ¡ª the very voters who became Trump supporters this year. Sanders will also be the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. Acknowledging that he has a ¡°heavy responsibility to help shape the priorities of the United States government,¡± Sanders said: ¡°I¡¯m going to do everything that I can to make sure that the budget that leaves the United States Congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking middle class and not billionaires.¡± With the announcement of Sanders¡¯ new position, Trump is definitely going to be a nervous wreck. He¡¯s spent his entire presidential campaign claiming that he would help the working class, and now Sanders is in the position to challenge him and hold him to it for the next four years. By elevating Sanders to this new role, Democrats are moving to a more grassroots message, fully aware that Sanders¡¯ presidential campaign and vision for America resonated with many voters. As we saw with Sanders¡¯ popularity in the primaries, the Vermont Senator struck a nerve with workers and families, making him the perfect candidate to go up against Trump as he takes office. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) commented on Sanders¡¯ new responsibility: ¡°We want to expand on that, and he will be reaching out to all our allies. We have a tremendous amount of talent in our caucus and we want to make sure everyone is contributing.¡± Sanders hardly needed this promotion to upset Trump, as he¡¯s been one of the most outspoken politicians on Twitter since Trump¡¯s win: Twitter Twitter Twitter 
However, Sanders¡¯ new role is great news for our country, and we know he¡¯s going to give Trump hell.

Donald Trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign, and he¡¯s only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the President-elect. 
On Monday, Trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access. This meeting was particularly important because Trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected. 
Some reporters in attendance were NBC¡¯s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd; ABC¡¯s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz; CBS¡¯ Norah O¡¯Donnell and Charlie Rose; Fox News¡¯ Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott; MSNBC¡¯s Phil Griffin; and CNN¡¯s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. It was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan. 
Unfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby Trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. Or, as one person put it , ¡°It was like a f*cking firing squad.¡± 
Trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. According to The New York Post , one anonymous source said: 
¡°The meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down.¡± 
This claim was backed up by another person, who said: 
¡°The meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. 
¡°Trump kept saying, ¡®We¡¯re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars.¡± 
This attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, Trump barely let them speak. While this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of Trump. He has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings. 
Americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is: Twitter Twitter Twitter 
Interestingly enough, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. She said: 
¡°Excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. Pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.¡± 
Disgraceful.

MAKATI CITY, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles) ¨C When completed by the end of 2016, the Trump Tower in the Philippines will be among the country¡¯s tallest buildings . But the Trump name may disappear from this upscale residential building. 
Launched in 2012, Trump Tower is a joint venture between Century Properties and the Trump Organization. It will be managed by Century Properties Management Inc. To rise at 250 meters above ground, the 56-story building is designed by award-winning international architectural firm Broadway Malyan. 
¡°It¡¯s really just an iconic, modern building, very tall, very chic, something that really symbolizes everything that a Trump project means,¡± said Eric Trump, son of Donald, and executive vice president of development and acquisition. 
It is located at the corner of Kalayaan Avenue and Salamanca Street in Makati City. 
But today, Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte issued an executive order canceling the building permit of the Trump Tower. 
Duterte called Donald Trump and his organization ¡°persona non grata¡± for the Republican presidential candidate¡¯s recent comments about the Philippines. 
It will be recalled that in one of his campaign speeches, Trump lumped the Philippines with other countries with terrorism links, calling for the banning Filipinos from immigrating to the United States. Duterte even challenged Trump to a fist fight. 
¡°If we, Filipinos, are not welcome in the United States, why would we welcome Trump in the Philippines,¡± Duterte said. 
Asked by The Adobo Chronicles what the Philippine government plans to do with the Trump Tower, Duterte replied, ¡°I will make it a rehabilitation center for the more than half a million Filipino drug users who surrendered as part of my war on drugs.¡±

DES MOINES, Iowa ( The Adobo Chronicles) ¨C Since he launched his bid to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald Trump has made many promises, but nothing has caught the attention of the media and electorate more than what he said today in Iowa, on the eve of the first caucus of the 2016 presidential elections season.

The Adobo Chronicles asked Trump what will happen to the media and the White House press corps when he travels across the country or abroad. 
¡°Well, they just have to book their own commercial flights and follow me around,¡± he said.

A top aide to Hillary Clinton urged the FBI on Tuesday to disclose what it knows about any ties between Donald Trump and Russia, accusing the agency of unfairly publicizing its inquiry into Clinton's email practices while staying quiet about the Republican presidential candidate.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a preliminary inquiry in recent months into allegations that Trump or his associates might have had questionable dealings with Russian people or businesses, but found no evidence to warrant opening a full investigation, according to sources familiar with the matter. The agency has not publicly discussed the probe.
A week before Election Day, the Clinton campaign was trying to contain damage from the announcement by FBI Director James Comey on Friday that his agency was looking into newly discovered emails that might relate to Clinton's use of a private server while she was secretary of state.
Clinton has voiced confidence the FBI will not find anything problematic.
Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook questioned why the FBI director had not released any information about the agency's Russia inquiries.

Release the information on his connections to the Russians,"" Mook said on CNN.
The FBI inquiry reviewed allegations that Trump or his associates might have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or engaged in contacts or commerce with people in Russia who are subject to U.S. or international financial sanctions.
The U.S. government has blamed Russia for cyber attacks on Democratic Party organizations. Democrats criticize Trump for taking what they say is a pro-Russia foreign policy stance.
Russia's possible role in the campaign again came into focus when online magazine Slate said a group of computer scientists had been alarmed by records showing thousands of apparent connection attempts between an email server operated on behalf of the Trump Organization and computers inside a Russian company, Alfa Bank in Moscow.
Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the server, which had been used to send out hotel marketing material, had been dormant for years.
Prominent U.S. cyber security company FireEye said it had been hired by Alfa Bank to investigate the records and had been granted access to the bank¡¯s systems in Moscow to look for evidence of any relationship with Trump¡¯s company or any signs of hacking or infection.

""USA! USA! USA!"" they chanted together in the Hilton Ballroom as the results came in. Who needs polls? They never gave him a chance but now we have it: President Donald Trump. Not only were the polls spectacularly wrong (who will ever trust this particularly bankrupt form of moralising presumptive analysis and telling us how we do and should feel?) but also the pundits who were not just arrogant about the fact that Trump had no chance but also were hopelessly out of touch with what America was thinking across its societal spectrum, what it wanted, what was felt deep in its blood.
It is a rejection of the liberal consensus the entire West has wallowed in since the 90's and a rejection of Obama and the false hope he decried, the impotent nature of US political leverage around the world and the rejection of brazen corruption and questionable ethics as typified by ""Crooked Hillary"".
The world must live with it; democracy has spoken and they're going to have to get over the words President Trump. Some will head for the hills, some will run to Canada, others will continue to cry but as Obama said yesterday, regardless of the result ""tomorrow the sun will still shine.""
This is a cry for American exceptionalism and like him or not Trump typifies that. He is committed to education, and demands high performance. Selling well is an admirable skill for a President to have. Negotiating with Congress, internationally, etc., is exceptionally useful. Trump has taken beatings financially and come out smelling like a rose.
Trump's business experience involves negotiations with business leaders and even governments around the world, and he likely has connections behind the scenes that surpass those of simply purely political candidates -- this gives him keen, realistic insights into economics in different parts of the world, as well as additional avenues to pursue trade agreements, and even perhaps some nuanced insights of particular financial weaknesses of possible global competitors, not to mention experience and insight into the partnerships and/or antagonism between different industries and particular governments.

What Donald Trump is doing is representing the absolute heartbreak and anger and frustration at a government gone mad and it seems the Left completely underestimated that in their vitriol in crying #NeverTrump and portraying him as the devil incarnate.
Although it is entirely true that Trump is ostentatious and has his mistakes, he brings something to the Presidential table no other candidate had before; he speaks his mind.
America clearly is sick of weasel politicians who are too afraid to say what people want to hear, they want the facts straight.
President Trump isn't cut from the political class, that class which is entrenched in its self-interest and has let the country down time and time again. Ross Perot once said that we need somebody to clean out the stables, a corrupted, ethically questionable President is therefore not the answer in order to accomplish that and I'm not talking about Donald Trump.
Trump is a pragmatist in an era of rapidly approaching chaos, he is not a social engineer, a think tanker who wants to please those lining his bank accounts. The liberal Democratic policies of Obama, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Sen. Harry Reid and their company created a climate that has led to this decision today.
So what if his language is intemperate and insulting? Even lacking in nobility from time to time? How can a true changemaker be straitjacketed by politically correct chains if he or she must express the will of the people, uncomfortable concerns that lie dormant for far too long?
Obama won because conservative voters stayed home. He had promise and he let so many down, what did Clinton have? And that is why conservative voters had to get out and vote.
Trump prefers isolationism on a world scale, Clinton voted to take us to war in Iraq and to overthrow Libya's Gaddafi, all in the guise of being ""muscular.""
Perhaps today's landmark and historic decision is not so much about Trump's strengths and power but more about the crippled weakness of the country in 2016 and you simply cannot blame him for that.",english,2016-11-09T17:11:01.619+02:00,ahtribune.com,DE,,Arise President Trump (or Why it's not the End of the World as We Know it),0,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/Donald_Trump_President_31de9.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Mohsen Abdelmoumen : Don't you think that we are in a continuation of the cold war between the USA and its allies in NATO on one side and China and Russia on the other, and who has interest to provoke a confrontation between these superpowers?
Brian Cloughley: It¡¯s not so much a continuation as a resurrection of the Cold War. After the Warsaw Pact disbanded in March 1991, NATO, although deprived of any reason to continue in existence, managed to keep going, and in 1999 added Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to its 16 members. As the BBC noted, these countries became ¡°the first former Soviet bloc states to join NATO, taking the alliance¡¯s borders some 400 miles towards Russia.¡± With good reason Moscow wondered what on earth the US-NATO military alliance might be planning.
In spite of facing no threat whatever from any country in the world, NATO continued to expand around Russia¡¯s borders, inviting Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia to join in 2002, which they did two years later.
As President Putin observed in an interview with Italy¡¯s Corriere della Sera ¡°we are not expanding anywhere; it is NATO infrastructure, including military infrastructure, that is moving towards our borders. Is this a manifestation of our aggression?¡±
The US is also implacably hostile to China and does what it can to provoke it in the South China Sea, but NATO has not yet ventured into Eastern waters.

It is dangerous to indulge in military menaces, but the US appears determined to continue such a policy, and the world as a whole will certainly not benefit from its posture.
How do you explain the silence of the media and Western Governments on the infamous war led by Saudi Arabia against the people of the Yemen?
The most important things are money and oil. Western governments and mainstream media may from time to time make statements that ¡°regret¡± the Saudi war on Yemen, but they will never take action against the Riyadh royal dictatorship that might make it cease its merciless blitz on the Yemeni people. The US State Department records that in Saudi Arabia its ¡°citizens lack the right and legal means to change their government¡± while there are ¡°pervasive restrictions on universal rights such as freedom of expression, including on the internet, and freedom of assembly, association, movement and religion; and a lack of equal rights for women . . .¡±, but Washington takes no action to encourage the Saudi monarchy to relax or even modify its domestic tyranny.
Saudi Arabia is a valued ally of the United States and indulges in ¡°torture and other abuses [and] arbitrary arrest and detention,¡± while ¡°freedom of religion is neither recognized nor protected under the law.¡± It might be imagined that the President of the United States might feel it proper to indicate his disapproval of the fact that in Saudi Arabia ¡°civil law does not protect human rights, including freedom of the speech and of the press.¡± ¡ª but no US president will ever do anything to discourage the Saudi monarchy from continuing its domestic tyranny and murder of so many innocents in Yemen.
Don¡¯t you think that, with Hillary Clinton President of the USA, we¡¯ll have a total war, knowing that she is supported by the neocons and the military-industrial complex?
Under a Clinton administration there would have been no cessation of US havoc-wreaking wars around the world, and desperate refugees would have died in their thousands. Her regime would have ensured that the Pentagon¡¯s fleets continue to go down to the seas in confrontation, and the bombers would have streaked across the skies, deliberately provoking China and Russia. Remember that she is one of the Washington-Brussels war-drum beaters who planned the 2011 aerial blitz on Libya to destroy the government of President Gaddafi, about whose murder she giggled that ¡° We came; We saw; He died. ¡± The US-NATO attacks on Libya caused massive suffering and destruction, opened the way for feuding bands of militants to fight each other for control of parts of the country, and created a haven for the lunatic extremists of Islamic State [aka ISIS].
Hillary Clinton has not criticised or questioned Obama¡¯s years of aerial bombardment around the world and her foreign policy adviser, Jeremy Bash, told London¡¯s Daily Telegraph that she would order a ¡°full review¡± of US strategy on Syria as a ¡°first key task¡± of her presidency, resetting the policy to emphasise the ¡°murderous¡± nature of the government. He said that Mrs. Clinton would work to get Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, ¡°out of there.¡±
President Assad has been selected as another target for the Clinton policy of ¡°We came; We Saw; He died,¡± and his country appears doomed to a rerun of the Libya fiasco.
If Hillary Clinton had become President of the United States, as seemed only too likely, there would have been even greater emphasis on global airstrikes and military confrontation. Greater turmoil, chaos and catastrophe were to come.
Several reports mention deliveries of Western arms to groups activated in Syria, weapons that ended up in the hands of terrorist groups, such as ISIS-Daesh and al-Nusra. How do you explain the miscalculation of governments that have delivered weapons to terrorists to find these weapons turned against them, as we have seen in various attacks on European soil?
The US supplies weapons to many rebels and insurrectionists around the world. One of the most absurd of these supply chains was in the 1980s when they gave hundreds of Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, then had to buy them back for half a million dollars each when it was realised that the Mujahideen were about to use them against civilian airliners. The British have also supplied ground-to-air missiles to insurrectionists groups, with much less publicity but on occasions with serious results. The only explanation for the motives of western governments in doing this sort of thing is that they are poorly informed by their vastly expensive intelligence agencies.
The Americans destroyed Iraq with their ally Tony Blair, Sarkozy made the same thing in Libya with David Cameron, how do you explain that these personalities are not judged, in particular via ICC, authority which judges only African despots?
The International Criminal Court (ICC) ¡°investigates and, where warranted, tries individuals charged with the gravest crimes of concern to the international community: genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.¡± But the United States ¡°is not at present a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court¡± and although Britain and France are in theory supportive of the ICC, there will never ¡ª ever ¡ª be a political leader of these countries arraigned before the Court for war crimes or anything else. The African despots it judges are no doubt guilty of heinous crimes, but they are also easy to arraign.
How do you explain that Hillary Clinton's candidacy was maintained while she does not stop making headlines with multiple scandals?
Because the Democrat Party desperately wanted a Democrat president. Members of the Party was prepared to hold their noses with one hand to keep out the stink of Hillary¡¯s scandals while with the other hand pressing the button to Vote Hillary.
In your opinion, why do Western Governments continue to support old leaders and despotic regimes and to destabilize others according to their interests under the pretext of ""human rights"", ""democracy"", etc.? Who gave them this right?
Nobody gave them the right to support or destroy any government, anywhere, but Western politicians and generals continues to believe that, as in the old colonial days, they have a mission to alter the lives of those they consider inferior. There is flexibility in this policy, however, because if dictators are important for the economies of the West, they are permitted to torture detainees, treat women as chattels, forbid freedom of religion and imprison critics.
Some of our European intelligence sources tell us that there was a mass movement of Daesh towards some countries of Northern Europe, result of the offensive on Daesh in Syria and Iraq. How do you explain that such redeployment towards Europe is possible with all the risks of attack that entails? Don¡¯t you think that the coordination between European intelligence fails?
I do not believe that there has been mass movement of Daesh/IS adherents to northern Europe.
Libya is a terrorist sanctuary a few kilometers away from Europe. You have an experience in both military and diplomatic, how do you see the resolution of the Libyan equation, is a crisis that can only be resolved militarily or is the policy which should prevail?
Unlike in Saudi Arabia, for example, in Gaddafi¡¯s prosperous Libya there was freedom of religion and women were regarded as human beings. The entire population received free education and medical care. Then the country was reduced to anarchy by the US-NATO aerial blitz of March-October 2011 (Germany refused to join in), during which, among other devastation, water and oil pipelines and pumping stations were deliberately destroyed. Militia bands took over various parts of the country and continue to fight against each other, while extremist Islamic [Wahhabi] groups have grown in size and influence and the ¡°Government of National Accord¡± is powerless.
Many of those who energetically supported the war, such as the former secretary general of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continue to claim that it was a success ¡ª ¡°a model intervention¡± ¡ª and that it is the fault of ¡°the international community¡± that the country is a shambles. But even US President Obama admitted that the war on Libya ¡°didn¡¯t work¡± and that failure to have a plan for the future of the country after the murder of President Gaddafi was ¡°the worst mistake¡± of his presidency.
Given that the Obama presidency is in its last months, it is unlikely he will order an invasion of Libya to try to eradicate the Islamic [aka Takfiri] terrorists and rebuild the country he and his allies destroyed. He and his supporters in Europe, notably France and Britain, will continue clandestine ground operations, drone attacks and conventional airstrikes to try to assassinate extremist leaders and destroy their gangs, but these will fail. It is difficult to predict the future in Libya, other than to say that it is most likely that its people will continue suffering the appalling effects of the US-NATO war, and that there will be no peaceful resolution of its problems.
Is the era of the American domination a fatality? Doesn ' t humanity may find it beneficial to see the emergence of a multipolar world ?
It should be remembered that in an August 2014 interview with the New York Times President Obama said ¡°Our participation in the coalition that overthrew Qaddafi [emphasis added] in Libya. I absolutely believed that it was the right thing to do.¡± The name of the game is regime change, but America, the ¡°indispensable nation¡± has failed in its military adventures all over the world and has created widening instability which in turn has led to growth in extremism and terrorism. Unipolarity, with the US possessing and exercising most military power, has not worked.
It appears that multipolarity might be a better alternative, with other nations restraining Washington from unilateral intervention aimed at overthrowing governments, but it is apparent that the US is determined to do all it can to prevent interference in its world domination strategies. In consequence it has engaged in a deliberate policy of confrontation with China and Russia that is entirely counter-productive and could well lead to war. Multipolarity would probably benefit humanity, but that is irrelevant to the indispensable nation.
What do you think of the defeat of Hillary Clinton and the victory of Donald Trump?
Mr. Trump has not elucidated a foreign policy as such, and we can only hope that he will build on the positive indications he has given about America ceasing to meddle militarily all round the world. His greatest achievement would be engage in positive discussions with Russia and China, which would result in vastly diminished tension in east and west. The defeat of Clinton has meant that the threat of US international confrontation has at least diminished, because the world would have been a very dangerous place if she had got in to the White House.

I grew up in a working class family and have experienced the deep racism of a society that views Vietnamese Americans as the targets of war. I've lived through successive Democratic Party administrations with little to celebrate. The Bill Clinton era brought NAFTA, which outsourced my Aunt's union job and forced her into the low-wage service sector. My mother never found a living wage job and relied on my father's public sector union position to meet our family's needs. In the 21st century, Obama expanded Bush¡¯s War on Terror, which merged my father¡¯s job with into the Department of Homeland Security.
Downward pressure on wages and working conditions forced my father to refinance our home multiple times to pay college expenses for my sister and I. Even then, my sister and I graduated with large sums of student debt. I have worked four jobs in three years and only one has paid a truly living wage. Another four years of a Democratic Party President was not going to make anything better for my family. That is not to say that Donald Trump was the answer to the structural problems of exploitation. But Trump's victory is not the end of the world, either.
Trump's victory is the product of global capitalism¡¯s decay. Millions of people voted for Trump for a variety of reasons, namely because he clearly labeled problems and outlined solutions to them. I don¡¯t agree with all of his solutions. White nationalism stains his domestic and international agenda. Trump¡¯s call to further militarize the US-Mexico border yet make peace with Russia is a contradiction in and of itself. A white nationalist billionaire who speaks the language of racism on the one hand and the interests of peace on the other is not exactly a model of consistency.
However, Trump¡¯s consistency is not the most important aspect of this election. Millions of people have shown their disgust with the two-party system of the capitalist class. A number of mostly white workers and whites from the petty business class voted for Trump. Trump also received more votes than expected from the Black and Latino electorate. Meanwhile, the elections produced a low turnout for Clinton from the historic Democratic Party bases of Black voters, Latino voters, and women voters. Clinton may have won the electoral vote, but the balance of forces ensured the ruling class would gamble on Trump. Trump's base of white workers and petty business elites angered by thirty years of monopoly capitalist assault are more of a threat at the moment than the millions of Democratic party voters who are now without a home. The round table of elites called the Electoral College could not afford any more damage to the Democratic Party than what transpired during the election.
So the Democratic Party is now on its deathbed and there is only one class of people willing to resurrect it: white liberals. A large section of the Democratic Party base wanted Bernie Sanders to be their next President. They did not hold their nose for Clinton. The legitimate concerns that immigrants and oppressed people possess with Trump's racism should not be led into the bowels of the Democratic Party. Yet for white liberals, this is the ultimate mission.
MORE... Brian Cloughley: ¡°The Greatest Achievement of Mr. Trump would be Engage in Positive Discussions with Russia and China¡± Arise President Trump (or Why it's not the End of the World as We Know it) Trump's sexual predator characteristics - His Grandfather was a pimp, but at least he paid the women he hired The significance of the GOP's attempted purge of Donald Trump Trump's victory has energized the white liberal section of the United States to fight back. White liberals began the process in a deep state of mourning over Clinton's loss. They then placed blame for Trump¡¯s victory on Russia, low-voter turnout, and the white working class. White liberals have blamed everyone except Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Now, white liberals in the US hope to wage a crusade against Trump in hopes of a Democratic Party recovery. It is all too clear that their primary intention is to get ahead of the genuine forces that rejected both Trump and Clinton and lead them into the Democratic Party graveyard.
White liberals love to hide their own racism and ruling class sensibilities through a process of appeal and betrayal. They speak with the authority of moral righteousness on the one hand and the knife of oppression on the other. They talk down to the struggle of peoples oppressed by white supremacy and attempt to steer it in a way that benefits their class interests. White liberals despise the working class because they understand that there will come a day when it destroys the system that they profit so handsomely from.
White liberals usually originate from the ruling class, the managerial class, and various stripes of the professionalized sector. Their class has ordained themselves the true leaders of ""human rights"" based on race, gender, and sexual equality. However, White liberals speak of human rights on the basis of a complete abandonment of the material struggle for liberation. In other words, the white liberal is the ultimate counterrevolutionary force in US society. It has wielded the so-called struggle for human rights as a weapon to prevent the emergence of class-consciousness among the oppressed and its genuine leaders.
The 2016 elections have shown that the broad class arrangement of white liberals is indeed in crisis and only has itself to blame. White liberals cannot acknowledge that it was their brand of politics that led to the Trump moment. Their dominance over the left in the US ensured that no organized force existed strong enough to challenge the ills of capitalist decline. Millions of people voted for Sanders based on his demands for material relief. Millions of people voted for Trump for the similar reasons, his racism and sexism notwithstanding. Whatever racism and sexism existed in his rhetoric could not ""trump"" the fact that the trade deals and wars he spoke out against in part drove ordinary people to vote for him. If the Trump base wanted racism and sexism primarily, they would of voted for Ted Cruz or Jeb Bush in the primaries.
So White liberal anger about Trump's victory is not directed at sexism, racism, or any other aspect of Trump's politics. White liberals are afraid of the sharpening contradictions of US society that threaten to squeeze them out of their privileged position under the racist and capitalist order. Millions of people are now asking where white liberalism was during the massive loss in working class income and wealth that occurred over the last forty years? Where were the White liberals during the endless wars that have been waged even more fervently by Democratic Party Administrations? Where were the White liberals during the erection of the largest police and prison state in the world, the institutions that murder and incarcerate Black Americans in record numbers and deport undocumented peoples at historic rates?
The answer is that white liberals were supporting the US capitalist system's assault on the oppressed every step of the way. This is what they are trying to hide with their anger over Trump. We cannot defeat Trump's white nationalism if the white liberal is not defeated with just as much vigor. White liberal ideology has a history of infecting social movements. As it spreads, it breeds the germs of Democratic Party control over these movements. But the Democratic Party made its own bed by acting as the more effective evil of the ruling class. If a powerful movement of the working class is to emerge in the age of Trump, then we must fight hard against the white liberal forces working hard to resuscitate the Democratic Party and build an independent party of our own.",english,2016-11-14T15:28:07.072+02:00,ahtribune.com,DE,,Defeating White Liberalism in the Age of Trump,0.04,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/Donald_J._Trump_149fc.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

China has warned Donald Trump that he will be defying the wishes of the entire planet if he acts on his vow to back away from the Paris climate agreement after he becomes US president next January.
The election of climate change skeptic Donald Trump as president is likely to end the U.S. leadership role in the international fight against global warming and may lead to the emergence of a new and unlikely champion: China.
¡°It is global society¡¯s will that all want to co-operate to combat climate change,¡± a senior Beijing negotiator said in Morocco on Friday, at the first round of UN talks since the Paris deal was sealed last December. The Chinese negotiators added that ¡°any movement by the new US government¡± would not affect their transition towards becoming a greener economy.
China worked closely with the administration of outgoing President Barack Obama to build momentum ahead of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The partnership of the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters helped get nearly 200 countries to support the pact at the historic meet in France's capital.
By contrast, Trump has called global warming a hoax created by China to give it an economic advantage and said he plans to remove the United States from the historic climate agreement, as well as reverse many of Obama's measures to combat climate change.

China is expected to play a pivotal role in consolidating and enhancing South-South partnership, particularly when it comes to issues related to climate change.
China is steadily ramping up efforts to assist other developing countries in addressing climate change, a gesture that has received wide welcome.
Speaking to the Chinese news agency Xinhua, Moroccan Foreign Minister and Climate Change Conference (COP22) President Salaheddine Mezouar said that China has an ¡°extremely important role to play in accompanying, reinforcing and boosting South-South partnership and support sustainable development policies in the African continent¡±.
Xie Ji, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation to the ongoing 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22), said on Nov. 7 that China has ironed out a concrete program to help other developing countries to become more climate-resilient. ""We will help build up ten low-carbon pilot zones, launch 100 climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, and offer training programs for 1,000 climate-related professionals,"" he said.
What Xie called the ""10-100-1000"" project is part of the effort that China has made in recent years to help other developing countries fight against climate change. The country has earmarked a total of 580 million yuan (about US$85 million) since 2011 to help developing countries, according to Zhang Yucheng, deputy director of the International Cooperation Division of the Department of Climate Change of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).

Saudi Arabia has warned Donald Trump that the incoming US president will risk the health of his country¡¯s economy if he acts on his election promises to block oil imports.
Over the course of the two-year American election process, Republican nominee Trump promised on the campaign trail to divest U.S. interests from ¡°our foes and the oil cartels,¡± referring mainly to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which the KSA is the largest producer and de facto leader.

Saudi Arabia is the U.S.¡¯ largest Middle Eastern oil supplier, though the North American country gets most of its energy from domestic and Canadian sources.
Al-Falih added that the free trade energy culture currently in place benefits the United States because it has created a refining industry and ignited a job-hungry shale revolution.

In these final days of the election the gloves have truly come off. Trump has just released a new ad which ties Hillary¡¯s email scandal and the new FBI investigation to Anthony Weiner, the husband of Hillary aide Huma Abedin. 
The Washington Examiner reports: 
New Trump ad targets ¡®pervert¡¯ Anthony Weiner, dubs Clinton ¡®unfit to serve¡¯ 
Donald Trump¡¯s campaign has capitalized on the latest developments surrounding Hillary Clinton¡¯s private email server, releasing a new television ad on Thursday that ties the Democratic presidential hopeful directly to disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner. 
Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, came back to haunt Democrats last week after FBI officials uncovered more than 650,000 new emails on a device of his, some of which may have originated from Clinton¡¯s unsecured server. The discovery led FBI Director James Comey to reopen the agency¡¯s investigation into Clinton¡¯s handling of classified material.

Dean James AMERICA¡¯S FREEDOM FIGHTERS ¨C 
Last week, the Pentagon issued a Defense Department directive that allows ¡°Department of Defense (D0D) personnel to carry firearms and employ deadly force while performing official duties.¡± 
The Defense Department has been working on changing the ¡°gun-free¡± zones on domestic military basis for several years in light of the deadly shootings at military sites in recent years. 
Military.com reports that the directive ¡°also provides detailed guidance to the services for permitting soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guard personnel to carry privately owned firearms on DoD property.¡± It authorizes ¡°commanders, 05 and above¡­[to] grant permission to DoD personnel requesting to carry a privately owned firearm (concealed or open carry) on DoD property for a personal protection purpose not related to performance of an official duty or status.¡± 
The directive also makes clear that DoD will consider further changes to grant ¡°[standard] authorizations for other DoD personnel, who are trained in the scaled use of force or who have been previously qualified to use a government-issued firearm, to carry a firearm in the performance of official duties on DoD property.¡± This would allow DoD with certain combat training to carry firearms without going through the additional step of making application with a commander. 
Kim Smith at Conservative Tribune notes that the policy was a response to an NRA-backed provision in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act that required the Defense Department to allow more service members to carry firearms on base. 
¡°It is a good first step in that it recognizes personal protection is a valid issue for service members, but there are many roadblocks in the way of making that option available,¡± NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told the Washington Free Beacon . 
Those wishing to apply for permission to carry a firearm must be at least 21 years old and meet all federal, state and local laws, the directive said. 
It would appear that the Pentagon saw no problems with implementing a policy for which President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support. 
President-elect Donald Trump ran on removing gun-free zones from military bases. On July 9, 2015, Breitbart News reported that Trump pledged to end the gun-free scenarios for U.S. troops by ¡°[mandating] that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases.¡± 
The immediate institution of this directive probably left President Barack Obama incensed, but he undoubtedly realized that there was nothing he could do to prevent its implementation in a couple of months anyway.

While the mainstream media has been working day and night promoting Hillary Clinton¡¯s candidacy, it has largely ignored or downplayed violent attacks against supporters of Donald Trump. 
But assaults on Trump supporters appear to be growing increasingly common as Election Day approaches and tensions intensify. Reports of Trump lawn signs and banners being stolen and defaced are everywhere on social media. 
Making matters worse, undercover video evidence emerged showing senior Democrat operatives Robert Creamer and Scott Foval acknowledging using dirty, likely illegal tricks against the Trump campaign. Their goal was to generate negative media coverage of Trump rallies by fomenting violence at them. The media eagerly used the various fisticuffs and melees the Democrats created to attempt to discredit Trump by depicting his supporters as violent, knuckle-dragging crazies. 
{snip} 
Despite their aversion to covering stories that put Trump in a sympathetic light, members of the media had no choice but to cover the extremely newsworthy Oct. 15 weekend firebombing of Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. Gov. Pat McCrory called the arson ¡°an attack on our democracy,¡± while one GOP official called it an act of ¡°political terrorism.¡± Spray-painted on the building next door were a swastika and the sentence ¡°Nazi Republicans get out of town or else.¡± 
Meanwhile, most physical attacks on Trump supporters make only local news outlet¨Cif that. Rarely do such assaults get mentioned on the evening TV broadcast news or in The New York Times or The Washington Post. That¡¯s because they don¡¯t fit the leftist narrative that Republicans are violent, racist, Islamophobic homophobes. 
{snip} 
Here is a compilation of some of the attacks on Trump supporters: 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, ¡°Why can¡¯t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?¡± 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. ¡°The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ¡®some thugs¡¯ that a barmaid called out from the back.¡± Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a ¡°Blue Lives Matter¡± shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a ¡°Make America Great Again¡± baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
On Sept. 26 at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, as the first presidential debate was about to get underway, a woman wearing Trump campaign apparel was assaulted while heading to a debate watch event. {snip} 
On Aug. 19 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Trump supporters had to run a gauntlet of angry protesters to get into a Trump fundraiser at the Minneapolis Convention Center. When they left after the event they were hit, pushed, and spit on. 
{snip} 
On Aug. 3 in Bloomfield, New Jersey, an assailant attacked a 62-year-old man who was walking down the street wearing a pro-Trump T-shirt, local police said. ¡°The motorist inquired why [the man] was wearing the shirt, directing profanities at him,¡± a police spokesman said. ¡°The [victim] continued to walk away as [the] motorist followed him.¡± The motorist hit the man several times with a crowbar, causing injuries to his arms, hands, and thighs, 
{snip} 
This is not an exhaustive list of violent attacks on Trump supporters. 
No doubt there will be plenty more such assaults in the final two weeks, as Americans head to the polls. 
And Hillary Clinton¡¯s campaign may be involved in those attacks.",english,2016-10-27T06:53:36.447+03:00,amren.com,US,94243,Anti-Trump Violence Sweeps the Nation,0,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Donald Trump called for a ¡°new deal for black America¡± in a Wednesday afternoon address as he works to bridge the gap he faces with the crucial voting bloc less than two weeks from Election Day. 
Speaking in Charlotte, N.C., the GOP presidential nominee criticized years of Democratic rule for leaving black America behind and outlined his plan to help. 
My ¡°deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education and high-paying jobs,¡± Trump said, speaking off what appeared to be scripted remarks 
¡°Whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. We live in a very divided country, and I will be your greatest champion.¡± 
{snip} 
¡°African-American citizens have sacrificed so much for our nation. They fought and died in every war since the Revolution and from the pews and the picket lines, they¡¯ve lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for civil rights. Yet too many African-Americans have been left behind.¡± 
Trump called for incentives to move companies into blighted neighborhoods to bolster employment, help African-Americans get better access to credit and push cities to declare ¡°blighted communities¡± disaster areas to help rebuild infrastructure. 
He also said he¡¯d support increasing the number of police officers in such areas, connecting a lack of officers to a rise in murder rate in major cities. 
But while Trump¡¯s call focused on removing ¡°gang members and criminal cartels,¡± he blamed Clinton for promoting a ¡°war on police.¡± He did not mention the accusations of police brutality by minorities who feel that they are disproportionately targeted.

Chicago aldermen on Tuesday hit Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump where it hurts¨Cin his formidable ego¨Cfor using a spike in homicides and shootings to paint a ¡°distorted caricature¡± of the city. 
The City Council¡¯s Transportation Committee unanimously agreed to strip Trump of a recognition he covets: ¡°Trump Plaza,¡± the honorary designation for the east side of Wabash Avenue between Illinois Street and the Chicago River, outside the 96-story Trump International Hotel & Tower. 
¡°We can actually use his own words against him: ¡®When you hit us, we hit back,¡¯ ¡± said Transportation Committee Chairman Anthony Beale (9th). 
¡°You¡¯ve hit Chicago numerous times. . . . When you hit Chicago, Chicago hits back.¡± 
{snip} 
As for the honorary street designation, one of the Trump Plaza signs already has been stolen. So only one more needs to be removed. That will be done post-haste, if the full City Council approves the punishment, thanks to a so-called ¡°pending passage¡± letter that Beale promised to sign. 
Reilly said Trump no longer deserves the honor after making political hay at Chicago¡¯s expense in a way that has damaged the city¡¯s reputation on the global stage. 
Trump¡¯s decision to portray Chicago as a ¡°war zone¡± that needs stop-and-frisk during the first presidential debate was the final straw.

From the start of Donald Trump¡¯s campaign, the media have covered him dishonestly. They have consistently portrayed him as a closet ¡°white supremacist¡± who deliberately appeals to ¡°racists.¡± They have tried to tie him to a wicked movement known as the ¡°Alt-Right.¡± They are now working on another dishonest angle: that Donald Trump is ¡°mainstreaming hate¡± and bringing ¡°racism¡± into public discourse. The media clearly want to stampede voters into Mrs. Clinton¡¯s camp so as to spare us the agony of a ¡°racist¡± in the White House. 
The demonization campaign has backfired. By trying to hang racial dissidents around Donald Trump¡¯s neck, the media have given American Renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before. At the same time, constant shouts of ¡°racist¡± and ¡°bigot¡± don¡¯t seem to hurt Mr. Trump: instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility. The biggest irony, though, is that Donald Trump is probably not one of us at all. But even small deviations from the cast-iron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about Donald Trump as a secret David Duke fan. 
Media dishonesty started immediately. When Mr. Trump pointed out that some immigrants from Mexico were criminals, the press acted as if he had said all Mexican immigrants are criminals. Then, when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call ¡°haters¡± and ¡°white supremacists¡± liked Mr. Trump, there was no end of articles with titles such as: ¡° Meet the Horde of Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and Other Extremist Leaders Endorsing Donald Trump ,¡± ¡° Top Racists And Neo-Nazis Back Donald Trump ,¡± ¡° ¡®Heil Donald Trump¡¯: Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists Show Support ,¡± and ¡° The White Nationalists Who Support Donald Trump .¡± 
These articles had a simpleminded purpose: discredit Mr. Trump by parading before the reader any Nazi, Kluxer, or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate. The implication was that if ¡°racists¡± were going to vote for Donald Trump he must be ¡°racist,¡± too. 
This was deceitful and one-sided. When the chairman of the American Communist Party endorsed Hillary Clinton , no one suggested this meant she was a communist. 
It is true that Mr. Trump gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet ¡°bigot¡± because he did not repudiate ¡°racists¡± with the snorts of indignation respectability requires. There was the famous exchange in February when a reporter pushed Mr. Trump to disavow an endorsement from David Duke. As The Hill reported it: ¡° ¡®David Duke endorsed me? OK, alright. I disavow, OK?¡¯ Trump said, seeking to quickly move on to another question.¡± 
That same month, there was another famous exchange with Jake Tapper of CNN : 
Tapper : Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don¡¯t want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election? 
Donald Trump : Well just so you understand, I don¡¯t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don¡¯t know anything about what you¡¯re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don¡¯t know. I don¡¯t know, did he endorse me, or what¡¯s going on? Because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. 
The media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy. ¡°Trump refuses to disavow white supremacists! That¡¯s because he is one!¡± 
There are far better explanations. First, Donald Trump is a pugnacious man. He doesn¡¯t like being pushed around by anyone, especially not by journalists who hate him. If Mr. Tapper had belligerently demanded that Mr. Trump agree that the sky is blue, Mr. Trump would have bridled at that. 
Second, Donald Trump probably doesn¡¯t know anything about David Duke or white supremacy. I would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of David Duke or any other alleged ¡°white supremacist.¡± It is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers, not some carefully concealed racial consciousness. 
The press has also pounced on Donald Trump¡¯s retweets of ¡°racist¡± material, which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist. Business Insider, for example, published this shocking story: ¡° 5 times Donald Trump has engaged with alt-right racists on Twitter .¡± Not one of these tweets is obviously ¡°racist,¡± and it would be surprising if Mr. Trump or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets @realDonaldTrump has sent during the campaign. 
Now the press is working on another smear-Trump angle. Recently, I have been contacted by journalists from such places as Bloomberg News, Reuters, and the New York Times , who clearly want to write that Donald Trump is ¡°mainstreaming hate,¡± that he is responsible for a huge surge in the Alt-Right. They want to know about all the people who have been flocking to AmRen.com because of what Donald Trump says. They want me to tell them about people who have been ¡°emboldened¡± to ¡°speak out against minorities¡± because Donald Trump has led the way. They would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting ¡°nigger!¡± because Mr. Trump wants to take a hard look at Muslim immigrants. 
I have explained to them as patiently as I can that they have it the wrong way around. No one comes looking for AmRen.com because Donald Trump wants to build a wall. They come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that Mr. Trump is a ¡°racist.¡± They come looking for us because Mrs. Clinton kindly called attention to us by complaining about the Alt-Right and her ¡°basket of deplorables.¡± I also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold Donald Trump responsible for the views of certain people who support him, few people would have heard of the Alt-Right. In their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors, they are promoting the Alt-Right, not Donald Trump. 
I explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before, for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign. It is Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Black Lives Matters, and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way¨C not Donald Trump. This will not change whether Mr. Trump wins or loses. The top landing pages on AmRen.com are analyses of race and crime¨Csomething Mr. Trump never talks about. 
I also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think Mr. Trump has mainstreamed ¡°hate,¡± by which they mean sensible observations about race. I ask them to name a single person who has been ¡°emboldened¡± to say something ¡°racist¡± just because Donald Trump is the GOP nominee. Of course, they can¡¯t. If anything, it is the opposite. Mr. Trump has been called every name under the sun for the mildest, most common-sense observations about Muslims and immigration. Anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever. Things could change if Mr. Trump becomes president, but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas. 
What Donald Trump has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that Mitt Romney and John McCain are no different from Barack Obama when it comes to preserving whites, their society, and their culture. I know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in November. I know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the Trump campaign. 
I point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about: giving the voters real choices. I note that the Trump/Clinton contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election. Haven¡¯t our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement, especially among the young? Well, now they have engagement, alright, but they don¡¯t like it. They don¡¯t like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a ¡° threat to democracy .¡± Liberals are such transparent hypocrites. They claim to love democracy, but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to. 
The whole Trump-is-a-racist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become. I may be wrong, but I have no reason to think Donald Trump thinks at all as we do. He has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary American with normal instincts: He doesn¡¯t want criminals sneaking across the border, he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy, he doesn¡¯t see why we need more Muslims, and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare. Millions of ordinary Americans clearly agree with him, and not because they are racially aware. It is because they are decent, fair-minded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways. 
I am convinced that Mr. Trump does not have a sophisticated understanding of race. So far as I can tell, he doesn¡¯t have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything. He has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time, but not because he is one of us. 
Maybe¨Cjust maybe¨Che will move in our direction. It¡¯s not impossible to imagine a President Trump asking, in an offhand way, ¡°What¡¯s wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the United States?¡± Or he might casually note that you can¡¯t expect as many blacks as Asians in AP classes because they don¡¯t have the same levels of intelligence. But I can imagine the opposite, too: President Trump so bogged down in Beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall. 
There is one thing that Donald Trump has changed. He has proven that Republican bromides about taxes and small government don¡¯t excite people. He has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties. He has proven that Americans do want their country to come first. They don¡¯t want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries. 
And even if he has not ¡°mainstreamed racism,¡± he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an American. On October 11, Roger Cohen wrote in the New York Times that Donald Trump is a ¡°phony, liar, blowhard, cheat, bully, misogynist, demagogue, predator, bigot, bore, egomaniac, racist, sexist, sociopath,¡± and a ¡°dictator-in-waiting with a brat¡¯s temper and a prig¡¯s scowl.¡± This must be one of the most unhinged, hysterical outbursts in the history of American political journalism. And it is unusual only for its wordiness, not its tone. 
Don¡¯t the editors of the Times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more Americans believe in Bigfoot (29 percent) than trust newspapers (20 percent)? Virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at Donald Trump and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself. Open, petulant bias is driving more and more Americans to social media and to sites like AmRen.com for their news. 
Despite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire American ruling class, Donald Trump is going to get close to half of the vote on November 8. Some 60 million people are going to vote for a man for whom Roger Cohen has emptied his dictionary trying to insult. Only one major newspaper has endorsed Donald Trump. Only one . And this is a man whom the American people might choose as their president. What better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion, between what Americans think and what our rulers want us to think? Donald Trump has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity. 
Whether he wins or not, whether he is one of us or not, Donald Trump has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors. Voters¨Cfinally¨Chave a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system. On November 8th they could bring it crashing down, but even if it still stands, it is visibly weakened, badly discredited. These are the perfect conditions in which our ideas will flourish as never before.",english,2016-10-29T04:38:59.696+03:00,amren.com,US,94243,Media Self-Destruct over Trump,0,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

To many, Donald Trump¡¯s pledge to build a wall along the US-Mexico border is unrealistic. But for Jim Chilton, it¡¯s the only way he¡¯ll get a good night¡¯s sleep. 
The 77-year-old, a fifth-generation rancher on the Arizona border with Mexico, says he has grown weary of seeing drug smugglers¨Crather than just cattle¨Con his ranch and a wall is the answer to his troubles. 
¡°I really admire Trump for having the insight and the knowledge to know what¡¯s wrong with the current border system,¡± he said, as he surveyed the sprawling desert plains of his 75-square-mile ranch that stretches to the Mexican border. 
¡°We need a wall. I¡¯ve been saying that for 10 years . . . and we need roads along the boundary and the border patrol to be deployed there and not let anybody in,¡± he added. ¡°It would make my life so much better and I¡¯d feel more secure.¡± 
{snip} 
Chilton, who admits that Trump was not his first choice among the Republican candidates for the White House, says building a barrier to secure the 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) US-Mexico frontier not only makes sense but is also a question of national security. 
{snip} 
¡°I live in a no-man¡¯s land. I live in a land that is occupied by the Sinaloa drug cartel,¡± he sighed, pointing to mountains on his ranch where he said scouts equipped with sophisticated equipment are posted as lookouts for smugglers. 
¡°I have seen cartel scouts on these two mountains before . . . and even in my front yard,¡± he said. ¡°I wave at them and they often yell ¡®hola¡¯ and wave back.¡± 
Chilton¨Cwho keeps a gun holstered on his hip, a rifle by his front door and a pistol by his bedside¨Cadded that he and other ranchers are also in favor of beefed up security in remote border areas as extremist groups like Islamic State (IS) may be using them to slip operatives into the United States. 
{snip} 
But beyond the drug cartels and threat of terrorism, Chilton insists that Trump¡¯s wall is all the more necessary for humanitarian reasons. 
¡°It¡¯s just outrageous for me to find a dead body on my ranch. It¡¯s outrageous for the border patrol to find a dead body and it¡¯s outrageous for my cowboys,¡± he said, referring to migrants who often die making the crossing into the US through the brutal desert. 
¡°This is as big a humanitarian issue as it is a national security issue.¡± 
{snip} 
According to the US Border Patrol, nearly 2,600 bodies have been recovered since 1998 from the desert in the Tucson, Arizona sector which covers 262 miles of the border.

Small towns in the Midwest have diversified more quickly than almost any part of the U.S. since the start of an immigration wave at the beginning of this century. The resulting cultural changes appear to be moving the political needle. 
A Wall Street Journal analysis of census data shows that counties in a distinct cluster of Midwestern states¨CIowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota¨Csaw among the fastest influxes of nonwhite residents of anywhere in the U.S. between 2000 and 2015. Hundreds of cities long dominated by white residents got a burst of Latino newcomers who migrated from Central America or uprooted from California and Texas. 
That shift helps explain the emergence of Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump as a political force, and signals that tensions over immigration will likely outlive his candidacy. Among GOP voters in this year¡¯s presidential primaries, counties that diversified rapidly were more likely to vote for the New York businessman, the Journal¡¯s analysis shows. 
{snip} 
The Journal identified the epicenter of this shift using the diversity index, a tool often used by social scientists and economists. It measures the chance that any two people in a county will have a different race or ethnicity. In 244 counties, that diversity index at least doubled between 2000 and 2015, and more than half those counties were in the cluster of five Midwestern states. The analysis excludes tiny counties that produce numeric aberrations. 
{snip} 
Mr. Trump won about 71% of sizable counties nationwide during the Republican presidential primaries. He took 73% of those where diversity at least doubled since 2000, and 80% of those where the diversity index rose at least 150%, the Journal¡¯s analysis found.

But a new Pew Research Center survey finds that Clinton backers¨Cparticularly highly educated ones¨Chave more difficulty respecting Trump supporters than the other way around. Nearly six-in-ten registered voters who back Clinton (58%) say they have a ¡°hard time¡± respecting someone who supports Trump for president; 40% say they have ¡°no trouble¡± with it. Nearly the opposite is true among Trump supporters, with 56% saying they have no trouble respecting someone who backs Clinton and 40% saying they do have trouble with it. Among Clinton supporters, those with a college degree have a harder time respecting someone who prefers Trump than those who have not graduated from college. About two-thirds (66%) of college graduates who back Clinton say they have a hard time, compared with a narrower majority (53%) among Clinton supporters who have not completed college. White women who back Clinton also are particularly likely to say they have difficulty respecting those who favor Trump: 68% say this, compared with a smaller share of white men (59%) and fewer nonwhites.

She Can¡¯t Ignore Donald Trump¡¯s.,"Loading Posted on November 2, 2016 This Professor Devotes Her Life to Countering Dangerous Speech. She Can¡¯t Ignore Donald Trump¡¯s. Colby Itkowitz, Washington Post, October 24, 2016 
When Susan Benesch began looking at how speech could incite mass violence, her research took her to far-flung places like Kenya and Burma. 
Lately, she¡¯s been unable to ignore a case study at home in the United States. 
The American University law professor and Harvard University faculty associate has grappled for months with whether Donald Trump¡¯s rhetoric constitutes dangerous speech as she has come to define it. She has examined election-year speech before, but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great. 
But in the past week, with Trump claiming that the election system and the media are rigged against him, his messages have the type of undertone that increases the risk of violence between groups, she said. 
Benesch, 52, has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech. To rise to that level, at least two of these five indicators must be true: A powerful speaker with a high degree of influence over the audience. The audience has grievances and fears that the speaker can cultivate. A speech act that is clearly understood as a call to violence. A social or historical context that is propitious for violence, for any of a variety of reasons, including long-standing competition between groups for resources, lack of efforts to solve grievances or previous episodes of violence. A means of dissemination that is influential in itself, for example because it is the sole or primary source of news for the relevan t audience. 
¡°Trump¡¯s speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it,¡± Benesch said in a recent interview. ¡°The meaning is so often ambiguous.¡± 
But when Trump said his supporters could use the Second Amendment against Hillary Clinton, ¡°it seems to me impossible that people didn¡¯t understand that as a reference to violence,¡± she said. Or when he suggested that Clinton and President Obama were founders of the Islamic State, something he alluded to again at Wednesday¡¯s final debate, that was a ¡°hallmark of dangerous speech to describe an in-group member as the enemy,¡± she said. 
And now, with Trump trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him, he¡¯s definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting. Direct incitement of violence is illegal, but Trump falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience. 
Because of that, it¡¯s still a gray area that surrounds whether Trump does use dangerous speech. 
¡°Trump may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of U.S. democracy,¡± Benesch said. ¡°Some of them¨Cthose who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messages¨Cmay therefore be more likely to commit violence. However, the United States is not in danger of mass intergroup violence, in my view. It is deeply irresponsible, though, since it can undermine some Americans¡¯ belief in our own democratic institutions, which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward.¡±

¡°Here in Minnesota you have seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state, without your knowledge, without your support or approval,¡± Trump said at a Minneapolis rally Sunday afternoon.

It¡¯s no secret that campaign contributions from higher education have favored Democratic candidates for years. When it comes to the current presidential race, however, data show that the gap between left and right has grown from a rift into a chasm. 
A Chronicle analysis of Federal Election Commission data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics shows Donald Trump raising a tiny fraction of the campaign money that the previous two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, drew from higher-education professionals over comparable time periods. 
Across higher education, donations in congressional and Senate races showed a ratio of Democratic to Republican giving similar to that of the two previous presidential-campaign cycles. But support for Mr. Trump stood at less than 8 percent of what Senator McCain raised from higher-ed professionals, and around 4 percent of the donations that Mr. Romney pulled in over the same time period, once the figures were adjusted for inflation. 
As of June 30, faculty members and others who work in higher education had donated $76,668 to Mr. Trump¡¯s campaign committee and to support ¡°super PACs¡±¨Cindependent committees that can raise and spend unlimited funds. By comparison, people working in academe had given $6.4 million to Hillary Clinton. Those figures account for donations of at least $200 that the Center for Responsive Politics has determined come from people associated with higher education. They are the most-recent figures available.

REUTERS 
Donald Trump¡¯s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was defaced by a vandal wielding a sledgehammer and a pick-axe on Wednesday in an act captured on video, police said. 
Los Angeles police expect to arrest someone for the vandalism, which left Trump¡¯s name scratched out of the star, the emblem in the middle dislodged and chips missing. 
A video posted at Deadline.com, a Hollywood media industry website, showed a man wearing a hard-hat and reflective vest swinging a sledgehammer and pick-axe in the pre-dawn darkness. 
The area had been cordoned off with traffic barriers and cones, giving it the appearance of a legitimate work site. 
The Republican presidential nominee, real estate developer and reality TV star has faced several large protests during his campaign appearances in California, where polls show him far behind Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. 
The former host of the NBC show ¡°The Apprentice,¡± Trump received his Walk of Fame star in 2007. A spokeswoman for Trump could not be reached for comment. 
Los Angeles police spokeswoman Liliana Preciado at the scene confirmed investigators have video capturing the vandalism attack and she said police expected to arrest whoever was responsible. 
Los Angeles-based City News Service reported a man identifying himself as James Lambert Otis said he damaged the installation ¡°to make a point.¡± 
City News reported the man said he had family members who were victims of sexual assault and had intended to remove the star, which he was unable to do, and auction it off to benefit women who have alleged Trump groped them. Trump has denied the allegations. 
Otis could not be reached for comment on the report. 
Trump drew widespread condemnations from voters and a number of Republican elected officials after a 2005 video emerged in which he was heard talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. 
His star on the Walk of Fame was previously targeted. 
In the summer, a street artist erected a tiny wall around the star, complete with miniature American flags and barbed wire. The art piece, which was later removed, made light of Trump¡¯s campaign pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. 
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce administers the hundreds of star plaques on sidewalks in the Los Angeles neighborhood. They are purchased for $30,000 each.

PRESS TV 
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has found no clear links between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Russia, officials say, proving false allegations by the candidate¡¯s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
The FBI spent most of the summer to verify claims by the Clinton campaign that Trump was linked to President Vladimir Putin, and Moscow was trying to influence the November 8 vote in his favor. 
However, the bureau failed to find any indications of the alleged ties after scrutinizing advisors close to Trump, investigating the real estate mogul¡¯s financial ties and even his emails, the New York Times reported Tuesday, citing law enforcement officials. 
Clinton¡¯s campaign voiced concerns about Moscow¡¯s intervention after a series of emails belonging to various ranks of the Democratic Party were released by the anti-secrecy website Wikileaks. 
American intelligence officials blamed the hacks on Russia and even threatened to come up with countermeasures of the same nature. President Barack Obama and high-ranking officials in his administration also blamed Russia for the breaches. 
Under immense pressure from Clinton¡¯s supporters, who were mad at Trump for calling Putin a great leader, the FBI started its investigation into the claims. 
The Clinton campaign has called on the FBI to publicly discuss their findings about the case, as they did with their new investigation into Clinton¡¯s new emails. 
FBI chief James Comey told Congress on Friday that he was reopening investigations into Clinton¡¯s emails after finding a trove of new emails on a laptop belonging to former representative Anthony Weiner, who was once married to Clinton¡¯s top aide Huma Abedin. 
At some point during its investigation, the FBI questioned Paul Manafort, Trump¡¯s former campaign boss, who has reportedly had extensive business ties in Russia and other former Soviet states, especially Ukraine, the Times noted. 
The bureau¡¯s agents also investigated an email channel between Trump and the Alfa Bank, one of Russia¡¯s biggest banks. 
After weeks of detailed investigation, the FBI concluded that the connection was nothing more than marketing emails or spam

While speaking to supporters in Cincinnati on Monday, Democrat Hillary Clinton hinted at a second civil war if GOP nominee Donald Trump wins, Breitbart.com reported. 
Charlie Spiering wrote: 
¡°He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart,¡± Clinton said to supporters in Cincinnati, Ohio on Halloween. 
Clinton specifically referred to the Civil War, suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from Donald Trump. 
¡°Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges ¨C the challenge posed by slavery ¨C and we fought a civil war,¡± she said. 
She warned voters that it was time for the country to take the divisions in the country seriously. 
¡°But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together,¡± she added, failing to admit that her side is the one that has divided America by race, class and gender. 
She also claimed that Trump would start a nuclear war if a foreign leader got under his skin. 
¡°I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don¡¯t think so,¡± she said at a rally in Kent, Ohio, earlier in the day. 
A post at Barracuda Brigade observed: 
Liberals especially the Clinton are always projecting. Anything that they accuse the other side of is what they are doing. She suggests that her message is one of ¡°hope and change¡± when in fact it is just more of the same. 
Moreover, Trump has spent a great deal of time talking about policies and issues while Clinton & Co. have done absolutely nothing but engage in fear-mongering and fingerpointing.

USA TODAY 
The man who caused a commotion at a Donald Trump rally Saturday said he¡¯s a registered Republican who wanted only to show his displeasure with his party¡¯s nominee. 
Members of the audience at the event for the GOP presidential nominee tackled Austyn Crites, 33, of Reno after someone yelled ¡°gun¡± while others were trying to rip away his anti-Trump sign. 
¡°I just went with sign that said ¡®Republicans Against Trump,¡¯ ¡± Crites said. ¡°It¡¯s a sign that you can find online. I held up the sign and initially people around me were just booing me telling me to get out of there. Then a couple of these guys tried grabbing the sign out of my hands.¡± 
Crites had no weapon. Secret Service agents later released a statement to that effect and let him go without charges. 
Agents whisked Trump offstage because Crites was near the front of the auditorium at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center. 
Crites said he holds no ill will toward the Secret Service or Reno police, who were just doing their job. 
¡°I was trying to get the Secret Service¡¯s attention for them to respond,¡± said Michael Newton, 45, of Santa Rosa, Calif., who helped restrain Crites. ¡°They didn¡¯t respond. I thought I had to do something. I put my knee on what I think was his head, so I¡¯m not really sure. There were five guys on him and he was moving. I tried to help them immobilize him.¡± In final Colorado push, Trump urges supporters to hand-deliver ballots 
Newton said he felt as if Crites were the aggressor. 
¡°I saw his hand contact someone¡¯s face,¡± he said. ¡°Maybe two people.¡± 
Crites said he didn¡¯t strike anyone, but after he was taken to the ground, he felt as if he were being mobbed. 
¡°Multiple people just tackled me down, kicking me choking me and just beating me up,¡± he said. ¡°That¡¯s when things even got crazier. I was on the ground and people were holding my arms, legs and I kept saying I can barely breathe. I was turning my neck just to get a little bit of air to keep from passing out.¡± 
That¡¯s when police intervened, taking Crites away in handcuffs. 
Newton¡¯s partner, Donald Newton, 47, of Santa Rosa took video of the immediate aftermath. 
The Secret Service said its investigation is ongoing. The agency uses magnetometers at presidential campaign sites, making it difficult for weapons to be smuggled into events. 
What¡¯s baffling to Crites is how anyone could have thought he had a gun. His sign was in the air for some time and he wasn¡¯t making any sudden movements, he said. 
¡°It wasn¡¯t like they noticed something suspicious and tackled me,¡± Crites said. ¡°That¡¯s not the case.¡± 
He said he backs some GOP candidates and just wanted to voice frustration with Trump, not cause panic. 
¡°I love all the people in that rally,¡± he said. ¡°We¡¯re all fellow Americans. They¡¯re doing their patriotic duty. They support their candidate. I¡¯m just there showing that I¡¯m a Republican. I¡¯m all of your people¡¯s brother. I just have a slight difference of opinion.¡± 
Later on Facebook, Crites wrote that he has no connection with the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton but has canvassed for her for about three hours, contributed to her campaign and voted for her. 
¡°Take what happened to me tonight as a classic example of dictator incitement of violence ¡ª against your own Republican brother with a stupid sign,¡± he wrote. The post and his entire account were taken down soon afterward as some Trump supporters on social media called him a ¡°Clinton thug,¡±¡°Hillary shill¡± and ¡°Trump assassin.¡± 
Shortly after the incident at the rally, Trump returned to the stage to raucous applause, thanking the Secret Service and launching back into his prepared remarks. His campaign later issued a statement also thanking the Secret Service and his supporters.

Midway through a stump speech riff lamenting that Hillary Clinton had appeared on stage with less-than-family-friendly musicians like Jay-Z and Beyonce, Donald Trump paused at an election-eve rally in Florida Monday morning to gawk at an attendee¡¯s mask. 
¡°This is different than a Billy Graham crusade, but you know what? We¡¯re all looking for the same thing. We¡¯re looking for greatness for our country.

Look at that. Looks just like me.¡± 
Trump then left the podium for a few seconds as the mask made its way up to the stage. He returned to the microphone and held up the mask next to his own face, before examining it closer. He held it up once more time and joked ¡°nice head of hair, I¡¯ll say that,¡± before tossing it back. 
¡°Is there any place more fun to be than a Trump rally?¡± has asked the crowd before resuming his remarks, turning to his proposal to stimulate job growth in the U.S. by placing a tariff on companies who move production out of the country.

Donald Trump is criticizing the FBI¡¯s decision not to criminally charge Hillary Clinton. He says ¡®¡®now it¡¯s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box.¡¯¡¯ 
Trump kicked off his Election Day eve blitz with a rally Monday in Florida. He told the Sarasota crowd that ¡®¡®the system is rigged, but at least we know it.¡¯¡¯ 
He claimed that ¡®¡®our country is a laughing stock all over the world.¡¯¡¯ 
The Republican nominee than pantomimed quotation marks when he said the word ¡®¡®justice¡¯¡¯ as he hit the FBI and the Department of Justice for their handling of the case. 
FBI Director James Comey notified Congress Sunday that a review of new emails connected to Clinton¡¯s servers did produce evidence that would warrant charges. 
11:45 a.m. 
An ex-aide to former President Bill Clinton alleged in a hacked email that Chelsea Clinton used the family¡¯s charitable foundation to help underwrite her 2010 wedding. 
The 2012 exchange between Doug Band and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta was released by the WikiLeaks organization. Stolen messages have chronicled tensions within the Clinton Foundation between Band and the daughter of the Democratic presidential nominee. 
Band told Podesta that Chelsea Clinton was gossiping to outsiders that she was investigating questionable spending. Band suggested that she is the one who should be scrutinized for ¡®¡®using foundation resources for her wedding.¡¯¡¯ He did not provide details about this. A Clinton Foundation spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Band was later forced out amid issues with his outside consulting firm.

Trump is telling thousands of supporters packed into a local fairgrounds arena Monday that the election is now in their hands. 
He told them: ¡®¡®Get out there. I mean, I did my thing. I worked.¡¯¡¯ 
Trump is planning to continue a frenzied campaign pace, with rallies in five states Monday, including North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan. 
Trump is also continuing to paint rival Hillary Clinton as a corrupt and alluding to the scrutiny of her use of a private email sever as secretary of state. 
Trump is also having some fun. At one point, he held up a mask in his likeness and complimented its hair.

The White House says it will ¡®¡®neither defend nor criticize¡¯¡¯ FBI Director James Comey¡¯s decision to send a new letter to Congress about Hillary Clinton¡¯s emails. 
That¡¯s the same phrasing the White House used when Comey initially announced that the FBI was looking into more emails related to its investigation of Clinton. In a follow-up letter Sunday, Comey said the FBI review was completed and it was standing by its recommendation that no charges be filed. 
White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Monday told reporters aboard Air Force One that the White House hasn¡¯t been briefed on the investigation and didn¡¯t receive advance notice about Comey¡¯s latest letter. 
Earnest says Obama still has confidence in Comey.

Philadelphia¡¯s public transit system will be up and running in time for Election Day now that a weeklong strike has ended. That¡¯s a relief to the state¡¯s Democrats. 
Democratic city officials were worried that the strike could affect turnout at the polls Tuesday. Pennsylvania does not offer early voting, so Election Day turnout is key. 
The state has favored Democrats in recent presidential elections, but polls suggest the race is tightening. Democrat Hillary Clinton is counting on strong support in the Philadelphia area. Both candidates are campaigning in the state Tuesday. 
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and the union representing roughly 4,700 transit workers announced a tentative agreement early Monday. Subways were soon operating on a reduced schedule and limited trolled serve was restored.

The Justice Department says it will send more than 500 staffers to 28 states on Election Day to monitor the polls. That¡¯s a 35 percent reduction from the number four years ago. 
Department officials say personnel will be sent to 67 jurisdictions to watch for potential civil rights violations. Monday¡¯s announcement comes amid rising concerns about voter intimidation, particularly aimed at minorities. 
The number of personnel is less than the roughly 780 monitors and observers who were dispatched in 2012. 
The Justice Department has said its poll-watching presence has been curtailed by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion that gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. 
In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the department is committed to ensuring that every eligible voter can participate in the election.

Clinton said Monday that while she thinks she has ¡®¡®some work to do to bring the country together,¡¯¡¯ she wants to be the president for those who vote for her and those who don¡¯t. She was speaking to reporters at an airport outside New York City. 
Clinton said she has ¡®¡®a big agenda ahead of us¡¯¡¯ and is vowing to ¡®¡®get a lot done¡¯¡¯ if she defeats Republican Donald Trump.

Ohio Democrats want the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in their voter intimidation lawsuit in the swing state. 
The party has filed an emergency request for the nation¡¯s high court to lift a Cincinnati-based federal appeals court order. That ruling Sunday granted the Donald Trump campaign¡¯s request to block a federal judge¡¯s restraining order Democrats said was needed to prevent voter intimidation. 
A 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals three-judge panel said Ohio Democrats didn¡¯t show ¡®¡®a likelihood of success¡¯¡¯ on their case¡¯s merits.

The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has surrounded the perimeter of Trump Tower with reinforced dump trucks in anticipation of Election Day violence. 
The dump trucks flank the skyscraper on all sides, and are supplemented by guardrails and heavily armed police officers. This morning, the building was not open to the general public and traffic crawled through a narrow corridor of trucks and police. On the street, supporters and protesters stood for interviews with a burgeoning press corps camped across the street. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump lives in a penthouse near the top of the building, which also serves as headquarters for his presidential campaign. (RELATED: Election Day Voting Has Begun ¨C Who Is Winning?) 
Police told The Daily Caller News Foundation that the dumping beds are filled with sand, which adds weight to each truck, in effect making it impossible to run the barrier. Police decided to circle the Tower with trucks as a hedge against car bombs, or some such similar incendiary munition delivered by car. The fleet of trucks will travel with Trump this evening to surround the New York Hilton Midtown Manhattan Hotel, where Trump is hosting his victory rally. The NYPD maintained a presence around the hotel for several days, which is also closed to the public. 
Guests staying in the hotel on unrelated business must present their keycards at a security check-point before entering the premises.

Moments after Donald Trump¡¯s stunning victory over Hillary Clinton for the White House, protests erupted in California and other states, including people crying ¡°Not my president!¡± 
The Los Angeles Times and other media outlets reported anti-Trump protesters amassing around the campuses of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and UC San Diego, among others.

SILVERISTHENEW 
There¡¯s more than one way for the establishment to yield power from this election. 
The first path is obvious, direct and potentially deadly. A Hillary presidency will be surrounded by bitter people, and overt uses of power, along with war, increased taxes and thinly-veiled pay-for-play politics benefiting the billionaires who¡¯ve bankrolled her rise to power. 
The other path is less predictable, but possible just the perfect ¡°magic formula¡± they need to get things flowing again. 
The Brexit vote, a by-product of populist anger against economic stagnation and political angst, was secretly a win for those who wield power from the financial sector. 
In the end, the disquiet of the people has proven to be the secret ingredient to stirring something up in an economy otherwise stymied by quantitative easing and dismal economic returns. 
As Zero Hedge explains , it just may be, particularly in light of some of the statements that have been made by significant figures on Wall Street: 
So yes, inflation is possible, it just can¡¯t coexist with political stability, which may explain why ¨C according to some more conspiratorial elements ¨C a ¡°surprising¡± Trump victory on Tuesday may be assured : after all, what better way to unleash political instability than to inaugurate the candidate who promises a full break with the establishment as we know it. If in the process, it leads to a surge in much needed inflation, now that QE has tried and failed, it¡¯s a price the establishment, reeling under the weight of record global debt, is willing to pay. 
One River Asset Management¡¯s Eric Peters laying out his inflationary ¡°revelation¡±: ¡°British spenders have entirely looked through post-Brexit uncertainty,¡± said Mark Carney [governor of the Bank of England]. ¡­ So the Bank of England forecast its biggest inflation overshoot since 1997; expecting 2018 price gains to peak at +2.8%. What¡¯s it tell us? 
A populist uprising, compromised free trade, immigration restrictions, a 15% currency devaluation, 0.50% interest rates combined with aggressive QE is today¡¯s magic formula for modestly exceeding a 2% inflation target 2yrs hence. 
[¡­]we live in the 2010s, and inflationary expectations have succumbed to decades of independent central banking. Economic volatility is remarkably muted too. With it has come a long period of political stability. [¡­] And we also know that a long period of political stability is drawing to a close. 
But we can¡¯t be sure that political volatility will increase inflation volatility. Nor can we be sure that it won¡¯t. It all depends on time and place. And today¡¯s time and place is something new. 
Is this proof that the elite are secretly planning to make lemonade from the lemons of American discontent and the wild card candidacy of Donald Trump? 
That is a difficult call to make, but it is worth noting that there is clearly an advantage to be held if this outcome does occur. 
As Tumelar notes, the fix is in either way: 
It¡¯s either inflation by Trump¡¯s victory or by WW3 started by Hillary Clinton. 
A hard choice for the banksters. 
Of course, the situation is much more complicated than just inflation, or any one factor. There is a great deal of speculation that the end of QE, known to be no longer effective at stimulating the economy has made a stock market collapse inevitable, subject to the Fed raises rates. 
It appears that Yellen has been waiting for the outcome of the election, and one way or another, will dump the next crisis on the next president. If that proves to be Trump, he will be blamed for the downfall¡­ meanwhile, there will be those waiting in the shadows to profit from disaster. 
For his part, astute columnist Brandon Smith has consistently argued that the elite have chosen Trump and will allow him to take the presidency ¨C only to use the unpredictability as a catalyst for order out of chaos, and the institution of great political and economic controls over the country: 
The vast majority of analysts in the mainstream and in the alternative media refused to acknowledge the possibility that a successful Brexit actually works in FAVOR of the globalists, because it provides them a perfect scapegoat for a financial crisis that has been broiling for years and is now ready to burst into flames. 
[¡­] 
I argue that the globalists want Trump in office, just as they wanted the passage of the Brexit. I argue that they need conservative movements to feel as though we have won, so that they can pull the rug out from under us in the near future. I argue that we are being set up. 
Again, the elites are openly telling us what is about to happen. They are telling us that if ¡°populists¡± (conservatives) gain political power, the system will effectively collapse. To what extent is hard to say, but let¡¯s assume that the situation will be ugly enough to influence the masses to reconsider the ideal of globalism as a possible solution. The elites are fond of the Hegelian dialectic and the philosophy of ¡°order out of chaos,¡± after all. 
Again, the reasons parallel the reasons that Brexit was able to succeed in spite of fierce establishment opposition. 
The master manipulators are adaptive to any market conditions, and their influence runs deeper than the electorate of any given political season. Its agents and officers instruct the candidates and make demands, not the other way around. 
In a puppeteer¡¯s world, must we always argue for the existence of puppets on every stage?

The 2016 election has been one for the record books. Somehow, two of the most reviled people in the United States have become the frontrunners for the most powerful job in the country ¡ª and the world.
On one hand, there is Donald Trump , the compulsively lying demagogic womanizing egomaniacal billionaire. On the other hand, there is Hillary Clinton, the infinitely corrupt influence peddling war-starter who allegedly cheated her way to the top of the Democratic Party while leaving a number of victims in her wake.
A significant portion of young people would actually prefer that a giant, apocalyptic meteor hit the earth rather than see Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump elected president.
It¡¯s not all bad, though ¡ª at least when it comes to the creative art that has been inspired by this nightmare of an election. One such example is ¡°Dillary Trumplon,¡± a recently released rap song written and performed by Blaise Guerra that¡¯s starting to go viral on social media. From Trump¡¯s demagoguery to Hillary¡¯s war mongering, Guerra leaves no stone unturned.
Listen to the song for yourself, then check out our interview with Blaise below (his responses have been slightly edited and condensed for clarity).
AM: What inspired you to make this song? Blaise: I was inspired to make the song because I felt very disenfranchised by the way Bernie Sanders sparked such an incredible movement but was completely ignored by the media and given no shot.

With the 2016 election campaign winding down, the Clinton campaign is ratcheting up demands for the FBI to publicly confirm the campaign¡¯s allegations that Republican nominee Donald Trump is secretly in league with Russia. Sen. Harry Reid (D ¨C NV) went so far as to claim the FBI has secret ¡°explosive¡± evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government that it is withholding. 
FBI officials familiar with their investigations into the allegations, which the Clinton campaign started publicizing around the Democratic National Convention, say they¡¯ve turned up nothing to connect Trump and Russia , leading FBI Director James Comey to decide against making any statements to that effect.

Aides to the Republican nominee told Fox News that Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee for the GOP and the campaign, held its most recent fundraiser on Oct. 19 and no more such events were scheduled.

By contrast, the Post reported that Democrat Hillary Clinton¡¯s campaign has scheduled 41 fundraising events between now and Nov. 4. The former secretary of state was scheduled to make her last personal fundraising appearance Tuesday in Miami. 
Mnuchin told the paper that the real estate mogul was focusing on making his final pitch to the voters at a campaign events rather than raising money in the final two weeks of the race.

Turki al-Faisal, who served as Saudia Arabia¡¯s ambassador to the US from 2005 to 2007, spoke against the presumptive Republican nominee during a foreign policy dinner in Washington, DC on Thursday. 
He blasted Trump¡¯s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, which the billionaire first formulated in December last year before renewing his vow on Wednesday. 
¡®For the life of me, I cannot believe that a country like the United States can afford to have someone as president who simply says, ¡°These people are not going to be allowed to come to the United States,¡±¡¯ Turki said according to the Huffington Post. 
¡®It¡¯s up to you, it¡¯s not up to me,¡¯ Turki added. ¡®I just hope you, as American citizens, will make the right choice in November.¡¯ 
The gulf nations represent three of the largest donors to the foundation, but that is hardly the extent of their ties to the Clintons. Qatari, UAE, and Saudi firms paid Bill Clinton millions of dollars for speeches during the time Hillary served as secretary of state, when she also approved weapons deals with all three countries worth billions of dollars to U.S. defense firms, many of which are also Clinton Foundation donors. 
Bill Clinton has praised the Qataris as ¡°intelligent, forward looking¡± investment partners for their collaboration on Clinton Foundation projects. One of Hillary¡¯s top advisers, Cheryl Mills, served on the board of the New York

It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. Reports are circulating that the Clinton¡¯s have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. 
This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn¡¯t plan to allow her or Bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. 
The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. 
Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e-mail server to gun-running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. 
Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration, John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million Nantucket mansion in June 2016 as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. 
President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. 
Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama¡¯s purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams, however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has. 
The Bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of 100,000 acres in Paraguay in 2006, yet another country good for the Bush family, since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime. If the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the Bush Administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on 9-11, the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request. Apparently, if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous, the Bush¡¯s plan on getting out of the country as well. 
Interestingly, the Bush family¡¯s Nazi connections dating back to WWII seem to have played a part in the Paraguay purchase since most Nazis fled to South America after WWII. Since George H. W. Bush¡¯s father Senator Prescott Bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the Nazis, the Bush family has a long history of being associated with Nazis. 
With the movement of huge amounts of funds, selling millions of dollars in real estate, and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas, we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in Washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions, murdering US citizens in the thousands, and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since 9-11 finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed. 
We are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a Nazi Dictatorship in Washington to an actual Presidential Administration who not only will look to the Constitution as the basis of all laws, but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people, for the people, and of the people of the USA.

""What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,"" Trump told Reuters on Tuesday morning at his resort in Doral, Florida. ""You're going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton."" The Republican nominee, who has called for a rapprochement with Russia in order to jointly combat ISIS, argued that his Democratic rival's calls for taking a more aggressive posture in Syria to bring the conflict there to an end and combat ISIS will only draw the US into a larger war. Trump's remarks come as he trails Clinton in most national and key battleground state polls just two weeks from Election Day. ""You're not fighting Syria anymore, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,"" he said. Trump: I'd 'love' to fight Biden Trump has not laid out a clear strategy for combating ISIS or addressing the globally destabilizing conflict in Syria, which has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions more to flee their homes. He has suggested the US should allow ISIS, anti-government rebels and the Syrian government to fight it out and more recently has focused on joining forces with Russia -- which has aided the Syrian regime in the bombing of civilians and US-allied rebels -- to combat ISIS. ""Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,"" Trump told Reuters of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom US officials have argued must step down. Clinton has called for establishing a no-fly zone over Syria to help bring the five-year civil war to an end, a proposal top Republicans in Congress have championed, which President Barack Obama and others have opposed due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia. A US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down a Russian jet should it enter Syrian airspace. Clinton addressed those concerns in the final presidential debate, arguing that it would ""save lives and hasten the end of the conflict,"" while cautioning that ""this would not be done just on the first day."" ""This would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground,"" Clinton said during the debate earlier this month. ""I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria. It would help us in the fight against ISIS."" Trump has additionally called for establishing safe zones in Syria to protect civilians -- as has Clinton -- which could also put the US in conflict with the Syrian government or Russia should they oppose the policy. The Clinton campaign later Tuesday pushed back against Trump's rhetoric. ""National security experts on both sides of the aisle have denounced Donald Trump as dangerously ill-prepared and temperamentally unfit to serve as commander-in-chief,"" Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said. ""Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria. Moreover, this incendiary attack is aimed at a policy that his own running mate, Mike Pence, strongly supports."" Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead While Clinton has accused Trump of being Putin's ""puppet,"" Trump knocked Clinton for her criticism of the Russian strongman, asking, ""How she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil."" And just two days after he tied the successful enactment of his agenda as president to the election of Republican majorities in Congress, Trump also returned to his more typical complaints of a lack of Republican unity weighing down his candidacy. ""If we had party unity, we couldn't lose this election to Hillary Clinton,"" he told Reuters. That complaint didn't put Trump in more of a bipartisan mood, though, as the Republican nominee also told Reuters he would not consider putting any Democrats in his cabinet -- a departure from recent presidents, who have sought to post at least one member of their rival party in a top administration post.",english,2016-10-27T21:11:23.336+03:00,awdnews.com,DE,,Trump warns of World War III if Clinton is elected,0,http://awdnews.com/images/1477586227636130853168961052.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,conspiracy,Neutral

""Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's mind about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy. Then you are doing the work of our adversaries for them."" Obama also encouraged the crowd of about 1,800 at Florida Memorial University to take advantage of Florida's early voting, telling the audience in doing so they can reject what the President called Trump's ""dark, pessimistic fear-mongering."" ""Our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters. That those who occupy the seats of power were chosen by the people,"" Obama said.

Donald Trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the November election will be rigged against him. 
""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning. ""Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!"" 
It's a charge that even other Republicans have been quick to refute. Critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the US democratic process. 
""States, backed by tens of thousands of GOP and DEM volunteers, ensure integrity of electoral process,"" Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who is often sharply critical of Trump, tweeted Sunday. ""Elections are not rigged."" 
Jon Husted, the secretary of state of Ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state, also said Monday that he could assure Trump the election would not be rigged. 
Trump's most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls. Before now, Trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early August. 
""And I'm telling you, November 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,"" the New York billionaire told Fox News host Sean Hannity in August. ""And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us."" 
Multiple Republicans told Business Insider at the time that Trump's assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous, as Trump would be the first US presidential candidate in modern times, possibly ever, to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election. 
Allen Raymond, a former GOP operative who was involved in the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone-jamming scandal, called Trump's continued insistence that the election would be rigged ""detrimental to the Republic."" 
""The idea that it's rigged, I don't know what he's talking about,"" he said in August. ""I know someone that rigged elections. I mean, you know, the fact of the matter is Hillary Clinton doesn't need to rig this election. Trump's going to win Alabama and that's it. She doesn't have to do anything. It's painful to watch."" 
Raymond wrote ""How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative"" as a tell-all about the attempt to rig the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election between then-Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, and Republican US Rep. John E. Sununu. Raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the New Hampshire Democrats office in Manchester ¡ª a task his phone bank was hired to carry out. Sununu went on to win the election by roughly 20,000 votes. Shaheen defeated Sununu in a rematch in 2008. 
The operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvement.He said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that ¡ª not what Trump's talking about. 
The Manhattan billionaire told The Washington Post in August that a lack of voter-identification laws would let people ""just keep voting and voting and voting"" and suggested fraud occurred in 2012 against Republican nominee Mitt Romney because there were ""precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican."" 
""I don't even know what he's talking about,"" Raymond said. ""But this idea that it's 1950 or 1960 and the party bosses are going to roll into Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines ¡ª that's nonsense. An election rigging these days means something totally different than what he's talking about. Now it's stupid stuff like what I did in New Hampshire."" 
He said the lack of voter-ID laws Trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus. 
""These voter-ID laws, what's the intention of that? The clear intention is disenfranchisement,"" he said, echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voter-ID laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots. ""You know, there's a reason we don't have a poll tax anymore. Because it's unconstitutional. 
""People don't vote 10 times,"" he continued. ""There might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times, but he's talking about an institutional effort. It's a total myth."" 
He said Trump's statements were an attempt to ""basically sideline"" Hillary Clinton's first four years in office. 
The idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the Democratic National Committee had its emails hacked and leaked, though both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton's main opponent in the Democratic primary, had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season. The emails showed that the organization, which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary, favored Clinton. 
Trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was ""rigged"" against Sanders in his early-August interview with Hannity, in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail. He used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well.",english,2016-10-27T21:11:33.687+03:00,awdnews.com,DE,,Donald Trump claims the election will be 'rigged' ¡ª and critics have called that preposterous and dangerous,0,http://awdnews.com/images/1477585908donald-trump-1.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,conspiracy,Negative

Leading Republican presidential hopeful suggests Israeli-Palestinian peace accord may be impossible: ¡®Sometimes agreements can¡¯t be made¡¯After being asked by a voter at a Charleston, South Carolina, town hall event hosted by MSNBC about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict, the GOP contender vowed to give it ¡°one hell of a shot¡± and called it ¡°probably the toughest agreement of any kind to make.¡±But when pressed by host Joe Scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either Israelis or Palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord, Trump declined to take sides. 
¡°You know, I don¡¯t want to get into it, because ¡­ If I win, I don¡¯t want to be in a position where I¡¯m saying to you and the other side now says, ¡®We don¡¯t want Trump involved,'¡± Trump said. 
¡°Let me be sort of a neutral guy,¡± he continued. ¡°A lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal. So I don¡¯t want to say whose fault is it. I don¡¯t think it helps.¡±Trump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a two-state solution, given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time. 
¡°It¡¯s possible it¡¯s not makeable, because don¡¯t forget it has to last ¡ª it¡¯s wonderful to make it and it doesn¡¯t work, but it has to last,¡± he said. ¡°To make lasting peace there? Probably the toughest deal of all, but I¡¯m going to give it a shot.¡± 
Though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement, he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate, and what he considers the root of the conflict. 
¡°A lot of people say an agreement can¡¯t be made, which is okay. I mean, sometimes agreements can¡¯t be made. Not good, but, you know, you have both sides really, but one side in particular, growing up and learning that these are the worst people,¡± he said. ¡°I was with a very prominent Israeli the other day. He says it¡¯s impossible, because the other side has been trained from the time they¡¯re children to hate Jewish people.¡±In the past, Trump has questioned Israel¡¯s commitment to peace, while at the same time suggesting the Jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the Palestinians. He has also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ¡°a good friend.¡± 
At a presidential candidates forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, the real estate magnate said, ¡°I don¡¯t know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don¡¯t know that the other side has the commitment to make it.¡± 
He made the same point in an interview with AP earlier that day: ¡°A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal ¡ª whether or not Israel¡¯s willing to sacrifice certain things,¡± he said. ¡°They may not be, and I understand that, and I¡¯m okay with that. But then you¡¯re just not going to have a deal.¡±

""What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,"" Trump told Reuters on Tuesday morning at his resort in Doral, Florida. ""You're going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton."" The Republican nominee, who has called for a rapprochement with Russia in order to jointly combat ISIS, argued that his Democratic rival's calls for taking a more aggressive posture in Syria to bring the conflict there to an end and combat ISIS will only draw the US into a larger war. Trump's remarks come as he trails Clinton in most national and key battleground state polls just two weeks from Election Day. ""You're not fighting Syria anymore, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,"" he said. Trump: I'd 'love' to fight Biden Trump has not laid out a clear strategy for combating ISIS or addressing the globally destabilizing conflict in Syria, which has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions more to flee their homes. He has suggested the US should allow ISIS, anti-government rebels and the Syrian government to fight it out and more recently has focused on joining forces with Russia -- which has aided the Syrian regime in the bombing of civilians and US-allied rebels -- to combat ISIS. ""Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,"" Trump told Reuters of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom US officials have argued must step down. Clinton has called for establishing a no-fly zone over Syria to help bring the five-year civil war to an end, a proposal top Republicans in Congress have championed, which President Barack Obama and others have opposed due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia. A US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down a Russian jet should it enter Syrian airspace. Clinton addressed those concerns in the final presidential debate, arguing that it would ""save lives and hasten the end of the conflict,"" while cautioning that ""this would not be done just on the first day."" ""This would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground,"" Clinton said during the debate earlier this month. ""I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria. It would help us in the fight against ISIS."" Trump has additionally called for establishing safe zones in Syria to protect civilians -- as has Clinton -- which could also put the US in conflict with the Syrian government or Russia should they oppose the policy. The Clinton campaign later Tuesday pushed back against Trump's rhetoric. ""National security experts on both sides of the aisle have denounced Donald Trump as dangerously ill-prepared and temperamentally unfit to serve as commander-in-chief,"" Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said. ""Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria. Moreover, this incendiary attack is aimed at a policy that his own running mate, Mike Pence, strongly supports."" Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead While Clinton has accused Trump of being Putin's ""puppet,"" Trump knocked Clinton for her criticism of the Russian strongman, asking, ""How she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil."" And just two days after he tied the successful enactment of his agenda as president to the election of Republican majorities in Congress, Trump also returned to his more typical complaints of a lack of Republican unity weighing down his candidacy. ""If we had party unity, we couldn't lose this election to Hillary Clinton,"" he told Reuters. That complaint didn't put Trump in more of a bipartisan mood, though, as the Republican nominee also told Reuters he would not consider putting any Democrats in his cabinet -- a departure from recent presidents, who have sought to post at least one member of their rival party in a top administration post.",english,2016-10-27T21:14:42.443+03:00,awdnews.com,DE,,Trump warns of World War III if Clinton is elected,0,http://awdnews.com/images/1477586227636130853168961052.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,conspiracy,Neutral

""Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's mind about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy. Then you are doing the work of our adversaries for them."" Obama also encouraged the crowd of about 1,800 at Florida Memorial University to take advantage of Florida's early voting, telling the audience in doing so they can reject what the President called Trump's ""dark, pessimistic fear-mongering."" ""Our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters. That those who occupy the seats of power were chosen by the people,"" Obama said. On Wednesday night's debate Trump, answered, ""I will look at it at the time,"" when asked whether he would concede if he loses on November 8. ""I will keep you in suspense.""

Obama also used the opportunity while in Florida to weigh in on the close Senate race in Florida between Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy.

Donald Trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the November election will be rigged against him. 
""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning. ""Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!"" 
It's a charge that even other Republicans have been quick to refute. Critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the US democratic process. 
""States, backed by tens of thousands of GOP and DEM volunteers, ensure integrity of electoral process,"" Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who is often sharply critical of Trump, tweeted Sunday. ""Elections are not rigged."" 
Jon Husted, the secretary of state of Ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state, also said Monday that he could assure Trump the election would not be rigged. 
Trump's most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls. Before now, Trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early August. 
""And I'm telling you, November 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,"" the New York billionaire told Fox News host Sean Hannity in August. ""And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us."" 
Multiple Republicans told Business Insider at the time that Trump's assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous, as Trump would be the first US presidential candidate in modern times, possibly ever, to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election. 
Allen Raymond, a former GOP operative who was involved in the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone-jamming scandal, called Trump's continued insistence that the election would be rigged ""detrimental to the Republic."" 
""The idea that it's rigged, I don't know what he's talking about,"" he said in August. ""I know someone that rigged elections. I mean, you know, the fact of the matter is Hillary Clinton doesn't need to rig this election. Trump's going to win Alabama and that's it. She doesn't have to do anything. It's painful to watch."" 
Raymond wrote ""How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative"" as a tell-all about the attempt to rig the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election between then-Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, and Republican US Rep. John E. Sununu. Raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the New Hampshire Democrats office in Manchester ¡ª a task his phone bank was hired to carry out. Sununu went on to win the election by roughly 20,000 votes. Shaheen defeated Sununu in a rematch in 2008. 
The operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvement.He said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that ¡ª not what Trump's talking about. 
The Manhattan billionaire told The Washington Post in August that a lack of voter-identification laws would let people ""just keep voting and voting and voting"" and suggested fraud occurred in 2012 against Republican nominee Mitt Romney because there were ""precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican."" 
""I don't even know what he's talking about,"" Raymond said. ""But this idea that it's 1950 or 1960 and the party bosses are going to roll into Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines ¡ª that's nonsense. An election rigging these days means something totally different than what he's talking about. Now it's stupid stuff like what I did in New Hampshire."" 
He said the lack of voter-ID laws Trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus. 
""These voter-ID laws, what's the intention of that? The clear intention is disenfranchisement,"" he said, echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voter-ID laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots. ""You know, there's a reason we don't have a poll tax anymore. Because it's unconstitutional. 
""People don't vote 10 times,"" he continued. ""There might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times, but he's talking about an institutional effort. It's a total myth."" 
He said Trump's statements were an attempt to ""basically sideline"" Hillary Clinton's first four years in office. 
The idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the Democratic National Committee had its emails hacked and leaked, though both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton's main opponent in the Democratic primary, had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season. The emails showed that the organization, which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary, favored Clinton. 
Trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was ""rigged"" against Sanders in his early-August interview with Hannity, in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail. He used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well.",english,2016-10-27T21:14:42.563+03:00,awdnews.com,DE,,Donald Trump claims the election will be 'rigged' ¡ª and critics have called that preposterous and dangerous,0,http://awdnews.com/images/1477585908donald-trump-1.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,conspiracy,Negative

Leading Republican presidential hopeful suggests Israeli-Palestinian peace accord may be impossible: ¡®Sometimes agreements can¡¯t be made¡¯After being asked by a voter at a Charleston, South Carolina, town hall event hosted by MSNBC about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict, the GOP contender vowed to give it ¡°one hell of a shot¡± and called it ¡°probably the toughest agreement of any kind to make.¡±But when pressed by host Joe Scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either Israelis or Palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord, Trump declined to take sides. 
¡°You know, I don¡¯t want to get into it, because ¡­ If I win, I don¡¯t want to be in a position where I¡¯m saying to you and the other side now says, ¡®We don¡¯t want Trump involved,'¡± Trump said. 
¡°Let me be sort of a neutral guy,¡± he continued. ¡°A lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal. So I don¡¯t want to say whose fault is it. I don¡¯t think it helps.¡±Trump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a two-state solution, given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time. 
¡°It¡¯s possible it¡¯s not makeable, because don¡¯t forget it has to last ¡ª it¡¯s wonderful to make it and it doesn¡¯t work, but it has to last,¡± he said. ¡°To make lasting peace there? Probably the toughest deal of all, but I¡¯m going to give it a shot.¡± 
Though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement, he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate, and what he considers the root of the conflict. 
¡°A lot of people say an agreement can¡¯t be made, which is okay. I mean, sometimes agreements can¡¯t be made. Not good, but, you know, you have both sides really, but one side in particular, growing up and learning that these are the worst people,¡± he said. ¡°I was with a very prominent Israeli the other day. He says it¡¯s impossible, because the other side has been trained from the time they¡¯re children to hate Jewish people.¡±In the past, Trump has questioned Israel¡¯s commitment to peace, while at the same time suggesting the Jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the Palestinians. He has also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ¡°a good friend.¡± 
At a presidential candidates forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, the real estate magnate said, ¡°I don¡¯t know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don¡¯t know that the other side has the commitment to make it.¡± 
He made the same point in an interview with AP earlier that day: ¡°A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal ¡ª whether or not Israel¡¯s willing to sacrifice certain things,¡± he said. ¡°They may not be, and I understand that, and I¡¯m okay with that.

The second presidential debate flew off the rails on Sunday night when Donald Trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against Bill Clinton and suggested that Hillary Clinton could ""be in jail"" if he's elected in November, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server. 

ABC's Martha Raddatz, one of the debate moderators, asked Trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking 2005 video released Friday, in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission, was consistent with his current behavior. 
""As I told you, that was locker-room talk,"" Trump said. ""I am not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for people of this country, and I'm not proud of it."" 
Trump then said if you ""look at the history of politics in this country, no one had been so abusive of women"" as former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the Democratic nominee, whom Trump suggested intimidated those women. 
Three women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with Trump earlier Sunday, and each was seated in the front row at the debate. 
""Mine were words ¡ª his were actions,"" Trump said. 
""So, don't tell me about words,"" he continued. ""I am absolutely, I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. Bill Clinton. He was impeached. He was no longer allowed to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who is here tonight. That when Hillary brings up a point like that, brings up words I say 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful. And I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.""

¡ª CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 10, 2016The former secretary of state responded by saying that ""so much of what he just said is not right"" but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign. 
""I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all,"" she said. ""When they go low, you go high."" 
""And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable,"" she said. ""But everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes to anyone for anything."" 
She mentioned that Trump had not apologized to the Khans, a couple who lost a son, a Muslim US soldier, during the Iraq War. Trump engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Khans after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention in July. 
Clinton also said Trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera, a federal judge who Trump said couldn't do his job fairly because he was of Mexican descent, and President Barack Obama, whose birthplace Trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign. 
""He owes the president an apology, he needs to apologize to our country, and he needs to take responsibility,"" she said. 
Trump responded by repeating the false claim that the Clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on Obama's birthplace in 2008. He added that she owed an apology for the ""33,000 emails you deleted."" 
""If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,"" Trump said. ""Because there have never been so many lies, so much deception. And we're going to have a special prosecutor."" 
Clinton said everything Trump said was ""absolutely false"" but she was ""not surprised."" 
""Oh really?"" Trump interjected. 
Clinton then mentioned the difficulty in fact-checking Trump, to which he capped off the exchange by saying ""you'd be in jail"" during his potential administration.",english,2016-10-27T21:14:42.630+03:00,awdnews.com,DE,,Donald Trump threatens to jail Hillary Clinton,0,http://awdnews.com/images/1477584851donald-trump.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,conspiracy,Neutral

""As I told you, that was locker-room talk,"" Trump said. ""I am not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for people of this country, and I'm not proud of it."" 
Trump then said if you ""look at the history of politics in this country, no one had been so abusive of women"" as former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the Democratic nominee, whom Trump suggested intimidated those women. 
Three women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with Trump earlier Sunday, and each was seated in the front row at the debate. 
""Mine were words ¡ª his were actions,"" Trump said. 
""So, don't tell me about words,"" he continued. ""I am absolutely, I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. Bill Clinton. He was impeached. He was no longer allowed to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who is here tonight. That when Hillary brings up a point like that, brings up words I say 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful. And I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth."" 
Donald Trump: ""If I win, I'm going to instruct my attorney general"" to investigate Clinton https://t.co/raPU4ICkl6 https://t.co/IWGVUleEtr 
¡ª CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 10, 2016The former secretary of state responded by saying that ""so much of what he just said is not right"" but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign. 
""I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all,"" she said. ""When they go low, you go high."" 
""And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable,"" she said. ""But everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes to anyone for anything."" 
She mentioned that Trump had not apologized to the Khans, a couple who lost a son, a Muslim US soldier, during the Iraq War. Trump engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Khans after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention in July. 
Clinton also said Trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera, a federal judge who Trump said couldn't do his job fairly because he was of Mexican descent, and President Barack Obama, whose birthplace Trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign. 
""He owes the president an apology, he needs to apologize to our country, and he needs to take responsibility,"" she said. 
Trump responded by repeating the false claim that the Clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on Obama's birthplace in 2008. He added that she owed an apology for the ""33,000 emails you deleted."" 
""If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,"" Trump said. ""Because there have never been so many lies, so much deception. And we're going to have a special prosecutor."" 
Clinton said everything Trump said was ""absolutely false"" but she was ""not surprised."" 
""Oh really?"" Trump interjected. 
Clinton then mentioned the difficulty in fact-checking Trump, to which he capped off the exchange by saying ""you'd be in jail"" during his potential administration.",english,2016-10-28T08:22:41.010+03:00,awdnews.com,DE,,Donald Trump threatens to jail Hillary Clinton,0,http://awdnews.com/images/1477584851donald-trump.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,conspiracy,Neutral

Former Illinois congressman and conservative radio host Joe Walsh appeared to invite armed insurrection when he tweeted that he was ""grabbing his musket"" if Hillary Clinton defeats Donald Trump in the presidential election. 
""On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump,"" Walsh tweeted. ""On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket."" 
""@WalshFreedom what exactly does that mean?"" CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted in reply. 
""@jaketapper It means protesting,"" Walsh tweeted. ""Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back."" 
Walsh's rhetoric comes as Americans are already nervous about what will happen on and after Election Day. Trump's insistence that the election is ""rigged,"" and his statement at the last debate that he would keep America ""in suspense"" about whether or not he will accept the results, have left some in fear that violence could flare up if his supporters refuse to accept the outcome. 
More than half of Americans expressed concern about violence on election day according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released Wednesday. 
Walsh dismissed another Twitter user's concern that his call to arms could draw the attention of the Secret Service saying, ""They understand that a musket hasn't been used in battle in almost 200 years."" 
""I'm serious,"" Walsh tweeted later. ""I don't think a musket would do much good these days, but it's time for civil disobedience on the right."" 
Walsh repeated his defense that he was only speaking of civil disobedience to NBC's Chicago affiliate. ""We're talking about a musket,"" Walsh said, according to NBC 5 Chicago. ""I could've said grab your slingshot and let's go. Metaphorically, I meant grab your muskets, if Trump loses, man, we're going to do what we have to do. We're going to protest and boycott and practice civil disobedience. We may start a third party."" 
This wasn't the first time Walsh, who served one term before being defeated by Rep. Tammy Duckworth in 2012, drew criticism for an incendiary tweet. In July he got national attention for telling President Obama to ""watch out"" after five police officers were killed by a shooter in Dallas.

Now, the man who took the photo is suing Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence for copyright infringement. Liberals accused the tweet of being insenstive, racist, and a micro-agression which forced them to seek shelter in the nearest safe room. CBC David Kittos, an expert photographer and former Cypriot refugee, says he never gave permission and never would give permission for his photo to be used in the ad. ¡°The image, the way it was used is reprehensible,¡± said Kittos from his home in Surrey, England, in an interview with CBC News. ¡°It¡¯s ignoring the plight of the refugees and it¡¯s completely unacceptable that someone who was born into privilege would steal my picture and use it to make this political point.¡± Kittos says when he first saw the tweet, he was ¡°in shock.¡± He explains he took the photo in 2010 as an experiment using artificial lighting and posted it on Flickr . ¡°I just couldn¡¯t believe my humble picture of some Skittles would just be used by someone so powerful.¡± Kittos says his lawyer reached out to the Trump campaign to discuss the matter but got no response. So he reported a copyright violation to Twitter, and about a week after it was posted his Skittles photo was removed from Trump Jr.¡¯s tweet. Even though his photo is no longer connected to the ad, Kittos decided to file a lawsuit at a federal court in Illinois. He says he wants to ensure the Trump campaign never uses the work again. As well, he wants to spread the message that ¡°they can¡¯t go around stealing from authors like myself. They¡¯re not above the law.¡± The Trump campaign told CBC News it¡¯s not commenting on the case at this time. Back in September, Trump Jr. defended the tweet. ¡°I am surprised by the reaction simply because it is a metaphor for risk,¡± he said at a campaign stop in Boise, Idaho. Trump¡¯s election campaign has called for ¡°extreme vetting¡± of immigrants to the U.S., especially Muslims, to help weed out anyone who could be a danger to American citizens. While Trump¡¯s position is popular with some Americans, his eldest son¡¯s tweet ignited outrage on social media. ¡°Sorry kid. For all we know you could be a poisonous Skittle,¡± someone tweeted along with a well-known photo of an injured and bloodied young Syrian boy. ¡°The stupidity ensues,¡± commented another person. Even the Skittles owner, Mars, Inc., weighed in. ¡°Skittles are candy. Refugees are people,¡± tweeted Denise Young, vice-president of corporate affairs. Kittos is seeking yet to be determined damages as part of the lawsuit. But he says he¡¯s not in it for the money (sure he isn¡¯t) and would have settled a for a public apology. Because that didn¡¯t happen, he says he¡¯s pursuing the lawsuit because ¡°it¡¯s the right thing to do.¡±",english,2016-11-05T13:37:30.722+02:00,barenakedislam.com,US,61606,TRUMP CAMPAIGN being sued for humiliating Skittles candy by comparing it to Syrian Muslim infiltrators,0,http://www.barenakedislam.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/shutterstock_222204877.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Donald Trump is on track to win more of the African-American vote than any other Republican in modern memory, said John Yob, CEO of a Michigan-based polling firm, Strategic National . And that¡¯s why Barack Hussein Obama is running around campaigning so hard against him for Hillary. While that so-called ¡°racist¡± Donald Trump along with Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali, were receiving the Ellis Island Medal of Honor from the National Ethnic Coalition Organization¡­ ¡­Hillary Clinton was singing the praises of Democrat Senator Robert Byrd, former leader in the Ku Klux Klan before becoming a U.S. Senator. Breitbart On Friday, a poll of 506 Pennsylvania voters by Harper Polling showed Trump has the support of 18.46 percent of African-Americans. An Oct. 30 poll of 1,249 likely voters in Pennsylvania showed Trump has 19 percent support among African Americans, while another 7 percent remain undecided. That poll has a error margin of 2.77 percent. In next-door Michigan, two nights of a tracking poll conducted for Fox 2 of 1,150 likely voters showed Trump with 14 percent support and 19 percent support. That¡¯s equivalent to a two-point shift from Clinton to Trump in the state. Trump is gaining in Michigan partly because many African-American voters ¡ª especially younger voters who backed Sen. Bernie Saunders ¡ª distrust Clinton, said W ayne Bradley, state director of African-American engagement for the Michigan Republican Party. That distrust has helped cause a sharp drop in the number of absentee ballots mailed in from Detroit, even as other part of the state send in more ballots that before, Bradley said. Faced with a low turnout, the Clinton campaign is trying to frighten African-Americans to vote, but ¡°t hat¡¯s not a convincing enough argument,¡± he said. Trump¡¯s gain among African-American voters is happening in many states, alongside an overall reduction in African-American enthusiasm and support for Obama¡¯s designated successor. That drop-off in support from Obama¡¯s 93 percent level will likely reduce the turnout for Clinton. That¡¯s a problem for Democrats, because a 7.5 percent drop in nationwide African-American turnout would be equal to a one-point drop in a nationwide vote for Clinton. Reports say the early-voting turnout by Africans Americans has dropped by up to 10 percent in North Carolina and by somewhat less in Florida . President Barack Obama and other top Democrats have hopscotched through the states to push that turnout back up by election day. But pollsters face problems when trying to gauge opinions in a high-stakes emotional competition. Some concerned people lie to pollsters. For example, roughly 7 percent of college grads hide their support for Trump when they¡¯re ask by pollsters over the phone, perhaps out of fear of penalties if their choice was made public. So when polls show a non-answer from respondents, for example, many undecided voters, the votes may be hiding a weak or strong preference for Trump. These factor may be impacting polls of African-Americans, who are being hammered by claims from Clinton and Obama that Trump is supposedly a racist. ¡°If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers ¡ª the Klan ¡ª and hesitate when asked about that support, then you¡¯ll tolerate that support when you¡¯re in office,¡± Obama told an African-American crowd in North Carolina on Nov. 3. (See above for Hillary¡¯s support of the KKK) A national poll by TIPP showed Clinton at only 75 percent support among all non-whites, including Hispanics, African-Americans and Latinos. That poll showed Trump getting support from 15 percent of non-whites , leaving 5 percent undecided and 5 percent supporting other candidates. Amid the disagreement, rivalries and complexity, Bradley is confident that Trump will do well among African-Americans. His final tally as the GOP candidate ¡°will be a higher number that it has been in the past¡­ [because] he¡¯s working, he¡¯s coming to these cities to deliver the message.¡± The African-American vote may even be enough to help push Trump over the so-called ¡°blue wall¡± of Democratic northern states that stands in his path to the White House.

By Michael Synder Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote.
Most Americans don¡¯t realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney¡¯s chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state.
Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a Quote: from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times ¡­
¡°I don¡¯t know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,¡± said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens.
Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney .
¡°I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney¡¯s name,¡± Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House.
She said that the first time she pushed ¡°Romney,¡± the machine marked ¡°Obama.¡±
So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time.
¡°Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,¡± she told Fox News.
And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago.
For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012.
If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren¡¯t even worth mentioning.
And of course this didn¡¯t just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country .
The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again.
In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper ¡­
Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes ¡°switched.¡± The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday.
And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas ¡­
Gary and I went to early vote today¡­I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn¡¯t get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don¡¯t hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed.
I don¡¯t know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that.
A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas ¡­
Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone¡¯s vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!
And of course they weren¡¯t the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon ¡­
So is there a serious problem with the voting machines?
According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots¡­
Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters .
Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a ¡°software update¡± on ES&S machines that otherwise ¡°omit one race¡± when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch.
Let¡¯s keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump¡¯s column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done.
But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else.
Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are ¡° no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate ¡°¡­
In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country:
Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote
Close to 3 million registered in multiples states
Approximately 24 million¡ªone of every eight¡ªvoter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate
More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters
Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state
But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled ¡° Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead ¡°¡­
Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.
Americans overall are more confident that the nation¡¯s votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner.
Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media.
And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up ¡­
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia¡¯s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election.
But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said.
Now that is a real ¡°conspiracy theory¡±, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn¡¯t so serious.
During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it.
The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us.
And let¡¯s watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.

This article was written by Michael Snyder and originally published at Economic Collapse blog .
Editor¡¯s Comment: In particular with electronic voting, the opportunity to flip votes and steal elections is almost unstoppable and will be very difficult to hold accountable. Nonetheless, that is exactly what activists in Texas and other key states should focus on. After decades of solid ¡°red state¡± status, they are now talking openly about Hillary winning the Lone Star State and flipping it blue¡­ despite being perhaps the most despised, unlikable and untrustworthy presidential candidate in modern history.
Take a look at the electoral college, and the shades of ¡®blue and red states¡¯ as things have been¡­ if Team Hillary is able to steal Texas, there will be no way for Trump to win 270 electoral college, even if he wins Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and other swing states. Perhaps this has been their secret weapon all along, and the reason that she has been so arrogant throughout the entire campaign:
These are dangerous times, and the establishment ¨C after systematically denying the voice of the people on many fronts ¨C is now making a huge gamble at holding onto power even in the face of obvious fraud. Will there be any legitimacy left in this country? And what happens if/when this election is stolen and everyone knows it?

Here¡¯s a letter to the Wall Street Journal :
Wilbur Ross¡¯s and Peter Navarro¡¯s defense of Donald Trump¡¯s economic policies is mostly a mash of bunkum (¡° A Vote for Trump Is a Vote for Growth ,¡± Oct. 26). Consider this claim: ¡°Donald Trump will cut taxes, reduce regulation ¡­ and eliminate our trade deficit through muscular trade negotiations that increase exports, [and] reduce imports¡­.¡±
Cut taxes? Bunk. Trump famously promises to raise taxes on Americans who buy imports. Reduce regulation? Rubbish. Trump promises more government intrusions into Americans¡¯ commerce with foreigners.
As for ¡®eliminating¡¯ our trade deficit, Trump might indeed succeed on that front. But such ¡®success¡¯ would be regrettable, for it would be the inevitable outcome of the American economy being made an unattractive destination for investment. (Ross and Navarro seem to be unaware that to ¡°eliminate our trade deficit¡± ¨C such as was done, for example, during the Great Depression ¨C is to eliminate net contributions by foreigners to increasing the size of America¡¯s capital stock.)
But Trump¡¯s most absurd promise is to enrich Americans by increasing exports and reducing imports. Imports are what we voluntarily buy and exports are the price we pay. Therefore, a policy meant to increase exports while decreasing imports is a policy meant to force Americans to pay more to foreigners and to receive less in return ¨C a decidedly unartful deal the architect of which would deserved to be fired.
But the Trump camp¡¯s confusion runs even more deeply. Exporting for Americans is worthwhile only because it supplies us with the means to purchase imports, either currently or in the future. So a policy that aims both to increase exports and to decrease imports is akin to a policy that aims both to increase people¡¯s spending power and to decrease it. It¡¯s a policy meant to give Americans greater means for acquiring imports as it simultaneously strips Americans of the freedom to use those means. It¡¯s the economic policy equivalent of an attempt to square a circle.

It is fun to look at polls, and using such data, decide which candidate will win which state, and ultimately, which candidate will win the electoral college. A lot of people and organizations do that, and for this reason, I don¡¯t. I do not have access to polls that no one else sees. Were I to use polling data to directly predict outcomes per state, I¡¯d use a method like that used by FiveThirtyEight, and probably come up with similar results. How boring. It would be a waste of my time to try to replicate the excellent work done by Nate Silver and his team.
Back during the Democratic Primaries, I decided that I wanted to get a handle on which candidate was likely to win, fairly early on. The polling based estimates were inadequate because most states simply didn¡¯t have polling data that early in the process. So, I invented an alternative method, which made certain estimates of how voters with different ethnic identities would vote. That method accurately predicted several primary outcomes, outperforming the poll based methods such as those used by FiveThirtyEight.
After a while, enough primaries had been carried out that I could switch methods slightly. Using the same exact model, but primed with the results of prior primaries (that year) rather than my estimates of voter behavior, I used the ethnic distribution data for each state to predict the outcome of upcoming primary contests.
Once again, my method was very accurate, and once again, it out performed the polling based methods.
So, recently, I¡¯ve tried to apply a similar method to estimating the electoral outcome for this year¡¯s presidential race. But, it is impossible to use the same exact method because the entire thing happens all on one day. I can¡¯t use the election results from a handful of states to estimate the likely future outcomes in other states.
I recognize that polling data is very limited on a national level. Things happen during an election season that probably change people¡¯s likely voting behavior, especially among independents. Solid states are rarely polled, and small states, swing or not, are rarely polled. Many polls are of low quality. Right now, for instance, fewer than half of the states have polls that were a) taken fully after the final POTUS debate and b) have an A- or better rating from FiveThirtyEight. If I allow the use of B and occasional C ratings for recent polls, and allow a few polls to include periods of time prior to the last POTUS debate, but only in states that are very strongly in favor of one candidate or the other (and thus likely to not move anyway), I can find 32 states that have sort of usable polling data. Interestingly, states with some of the more controversial changes happening, like Utah and Iowa, are not adequately polled.
In order to apply a model like the one I used in the Primaries to the current election, I used the 32 states for which there was somewhat acceptable recent polling data to inform the model (to calculate the regression coefficients) in order to then, separately, predict the likely voting behavior (Trump vs. Clinton) in all of the states.
Before I show you the map, however, I need to discuss something else.
About a week ago the press, especially the somewhat more left leaning press, and various commenters, seeing much reaction to a series of events beginning with the NYT release of Trump¡¯s tax return and ending with the final POTUS debate, events which sandwiched the sexual assault tapes and accusations, collectively decided that a huge gap between Clinton and Trump was rapidly opening up and the race would end with a double digit spread, an electoral rout, and a big party.
Soon after, I pointed out that this may not be correct. That polling data seemed to show, rather, that there was an expansion of the difference between the two candidates followed by a re-closing of the gap, with Clinton still leading but by about as much as before this temporary shift. To this I added a concern. If too many people assumed that the race was over and in the double digit range, perhaps there could be a GOTV backlash effect, or a funding effect, that would shift things to within shooting distance for Trump.
I was not alone in thinking this, and I was probably right. The GOP sunk, via pacs, 25 million dollars into Senate races in response to the Democrats shifting from the national race to the Senate, which was followed by the Democrats shifting back to the national race in certain states, presumably recognizing that the polls were artificially spread. Indeed, some who criticized (arguing mainly from incredulity and good wishes) my admonition noted, correctly, that some of that narrowing was because a bunch of right-leaning polls had come out all at once. This is true, but it ignores that a bunch of left-leaning polls had made the formation of the Great Gap of GOP Defeat look a lot bigger than it ever really was.
I say all this as part one of my preparation for what I¡¯m going to tell you below, which is not the news you want to hear. Part two is some logic I¡¯d like to bludgeon you with.
Consider these points:
1) True Trump supporters could give a rat¡¯s ass about sexual assault, poor debate performance, or tax forms. Donald Trump was correct when he said, weeks ago, now forgotten, that he could gun someone down on the streets of Manhattan and he would not lose support form his base. These people did not abandon him when he was heard to talk about sexual assault. If anything, they were energized by it. And, I¡¯m talking about something just shy of 40% of the voters. We live in a barely civilized asshole country.
2) Please tell me exactly which Hillary Clinton supporters, who were going to vote for Clinton over Trump all along, are NOW going to pick Clinton (if polled or on voting day) that change from not being Clinton supporters to being Clinton supporters? In other words (this is a somewhat subtle point) which people who hated Trump became True Haters of Trump after the sexual assault thing? Almost none. They were already there.
3) The third category of people, the undecideds (who are only lying about being undecided, in most cases) and the so-called ¡°reasonable Republicans¡± (of which there are very, very few), who could conceivably shift from Trump to Clinton are going to divide their voting activities between Johnson, a write in (as they are being advised by Republican leaders in some cases) or simply staying home.
In other words, over the last few weeks, no source has emerged that hands Secretary Clinton more electoral votes than she probably had about a month ago, and Trump is not going to have any, or at least not many, electoral votes go away.
Those observations (part one) and that logic (part two) cause me to be utterly unsurprised to find out that an analysis of the electoral map I did on October 16th and one I did today do not show Clinton pulling farther ahead. In fact, the two analyses have Clinton being less far ahead than Trump now than ten days ago. The difference is in Ohio (shifting from Clinton to Trump) which is almost certainly going to happen, and North Carolina (which shifted from Clinton to Trump in this analysis) which seems much less likely to happen, and Arizona shifting from Clinton (that was probably wishful thinking) to Trump.
The point here is this, plain and simple. An analysis using a technique that has worked very well for me in the past shows that the difference between that moment of Maximal Clintonosity and today is plus or minus a couple of state. In other words, not different. Maybe a little worse. Really, about the same.
Here¡¯s the current map:
Obviously, I will be watching for more data over the next few days. I assume there will be a spate of polls as we approach November 8th (the day Democrats vote. Republicans vote on the 28th of November). If so, then there will be convergence between my method of calibration and my method of calculation, and the model will consume itself by the tail and become very accurate at the same time.
But between now and then, perhaps that very small number of polls that are both recent and high quality will grow a bit more and I can do this again and resolve those closer states.
By the way, the ¡°swing states¡± according to my model, the states where things are close, are Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia of those now in the Trump column.

Ivanka Trump is going to have to back off from her father¡¯s campaign, because the hateful and sexist rhetoric of Donald Trump is severely hurting Ivanka¡¯s clothing and lifestyle brand.
Women are turning on Ivanka Trump as she continues supporting her father despite allegations of sexual harassment against him and a 2005 audio tape capturing him bragging in lewd terms that he can do whatever he wants to women.
Now, the growing group of women are boycotting her line of clothing, jewelry, perfume and accessories sold as part of the Ivanka Trump Collection. They are also calling on the stores that carry the brand, including Nordstrom, Bloomingdale¡¯s and Macy¡¯s, to stop selling it.
It has even created its own hashtag, #Ivankant, as well as #GrabYourWallet.
From The Daily Mail :
¡®If Ivanka Trump had distanced herself from the campaign I would not be boycotting her,¡¯ Shannon Coulter, who called on Americans to boycott the brand earlier this month, told the Guardian.
¡®But something changed for me when that tape was released.¡¯
Coulter, who shared her own experience of sexual harassment at the hands of a male superior, launched the hashtag ¡®GrabYourWallet¡¯ on October 11, a reference to Trump¡¯s offensive ¡®grab them by the p***y¡¯ remark from the audio tape.
The problem obviously for Ivanka, is that Donald Trump¡¯s base, for the most part, doesn¡¯t shop at Bloomingdale¡¯s or Nordstrom, which are two of the largest stores that carry her clothing line, along with Macy¡¯s.
What are your thoughts, should Ivanka¡¯s business be hurt because of the actions of her father?
From Politico:
The New York Times cited a deposition from a woman who claimed that Donald Trump groped her under the table decades ago, but the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is certainly not a groper, his daughter said Wednesday.
¡°Look, I¡¯m not in every interaction my father has, but he¡¯s not a groper,¡± Ivanka Trump said in an interview broadcast Wednesday on ¡°CBS This Morning.¡± ¡°It¡¯s not who he is. And I¡¯ve known my father obviously my whole life and he has total respect for women.¡±
The billionaire businessman launched a Twitter salvo the ¡°failing¡± newspaper for its ¡°false, malicious & libelous story,¡± catapulting the story to become the newspaper¡¯s most popular of the year, according to assistant news editor Theodore Kim.
¡ª
Ivanka Trump said she read the Sunday cover story and ¡°found it to be pretty disturbing, based on the facts as I know them, and obviously I very much know them¡± as a daughter and an executive who¡¯s worked alongside him for more than a decade.
¡°I was bothered by it, but it¡¯s largely been discredited since,¡± she said, referring to Brewer Lane¡¯s criticism of the report. Brewer Lane, the ex-girlfriend whose first run-in with Donald Trump was used as the lead anecdote for the article, titled ¡°Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private,¡± accused the newspaper of putting a negative connotation on her words.
¡°Most of the time when stories are inaccurate they¡¯re not discredited, and I will be frustrated by that, but in this case I think they went so far,¡± Ivanka Trump continued. ¡°They had such a strong thesis and created facts to reinforce it and, you know, I think that narrative has been playing out now and there¡¯s backlash in that regard.¡±

¡°That¡¯s going to be you,¡± the Academy of Excellence teacher allegedly warned a 12-year-old Muslim student after showing the class a movie about the 9/11 attacks. And if that sounds outrageous, brace yourself because it gets a lot worse. 
No wonder the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Arizona are siccing the U.S. Dept. of Justice and the U.S. Dept. of Education on this travesty of a public charter school and this shameful example of an educator¡¯s sorry a**. Heather Weaver from the ACLU¡¯s national office reports they¡¯ve filed formal complaints on behalf of the Muslim student and his family. 
Asli Noor and her five children are refugees who settled in Phoenix, Arizona after fleeing Somalia. Like most parents, she wants opportunities and a good education for her children. And for many families ¡ª especially those living in low-income neighborhoods ¡ª that means a public charter school like the sadly misnamed ¡°Excellence Academy.¡± 
The boy and his eight-year-old sister (referred to in the complaint as A.A. and F.A.) had started the 2015-2016 school year when the family¡¯s new set of troubles began. 
According to the complaints, an ¡°Academy of Excellence¡± teacher named Faye Myles began ¡°singling out¡± the then 11-year-old, sixth grade Muslim student as the 2015-16 school year began for ¡°disfavorable treatment because of his faith and nationality.¡± 
¡®Another time, when A.A. raised his hand to answer a question, his teacher snapped at him?¡ª?¡°All you Muslims think you are so smart¡±?¡ª?in front of the entire class.¡¯ 
Oh, and then the boy recalls the math and science teacher for grades 5-8 digressing into a special kind of lesson in civics and current events. 
¡®I can¡¯t wait until Trump is elected. He¡¯s going to deport all you Muslims. Muslims shouldn¡¯t be given visas. They¡¯ll probably take away your visa and deport you. You¡¯re going to be the next terrorist, I bet.¡¯ 
Faye Myles also allegedly found other ways to wound her young Muslim student with her bigotry. She repeatedly denied him the right to pray during recess, which is hard to imagine ever happening to a Christian student. The child also claims his ¡°Academy of Excellence¡± teacher would also would tell him to ¡°shut up¡± and punish him during class ¡°downtime¡± when the other students were allowed to talk with each other. 
The bus rides home added to the child¡¯s misery as his classmates began to follow the teacher¡¯s example and pile on the insults. 
¡®On the bus ride home, A.A.¡¯s classmates took up his teacher¡¯s anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant crusade, taunting him about the fact that his visa would be revoked because he is a Muslim, calling him a ¡°terrorist,¡± and accusing him of planning to blow up the bus.¡¯ 
The child, of course, started feeling anxious and physically ill ¡°with a stomach ache¡± and had no desire to return to the ¡°Academy of Excellence.¡± 
In January, Asli Noor met with school officials to complain about these incidents. Three days later, the school asked her to pick her son up early because he had supposedly tried to open the school bus¡¯ emergency window. Noor demanded they verify these accusations with footage from the security camera but school officials refused. 
And then Brenda Nelson, an ¡°Academy of Excellence¡± board member, printed out two ¡°voluntary¡± withdrawal forms for A.A. and his younger sister F.A. She then allegedly ordered Ms. Noor to sign them, saying: 
¡®Get your kids out of here. I don¡¯t want them here.¡¯ 
When Asri Noor begged for time to find another school for her children, Brenda Nelson callously refused. 
Unfortunately, these incidents of anti-Muslim bigotry in publicly-funded schools are happening more frequently. Think Progress reports that even in schools where teachers try to fight it, Trump-inspired bullying is a serious issue. 
¡®In spite of some teachers¡¯ valiant efforts to teach students about Trump, it would appear that schoolchildren already invoke the candidate¡¯s name to scare their Latino and Muslim classmates, referencing the candidate¡¯s harsh claims of Latino criminals and Muslim terrorists.¡¯ 
And, sadly, it¡¯s not just the kids. 
¡®A predominantly Latino elementary school in California was graffiti-tagged with the words ¡°Build the wall higher¡± last week, alluding to Trump¡¯s policy plan to build a southern U.S. border wall to keep out undocumented immigrants.¡¯ 
And in case you assume the ¡°Academy of Excellence¡± teacher is one of those mean white Trump supporters, you¡¯re wrong. Apparently, she¡¯s a mean black Trump supporter. @KhaledBeydoun The teacher works at Academy of Excellence & her name is Faye Myles per the article. She should be called out. pic.twitter.com/BbL3YdzEG8

An unidentified supporter of Republican presidential candidate and alleged unregistered sex offender Donald Trump took to violently harassing members of the media at a Saturday night rally held in Phoenix, Arizona. 
The man, wearing a ¡°Hillary for Prison¡± t-shirt, screamed into the press area, ¡°You¡¯re going down! You¡¯re the enemy! You¡¯re the ones working for the devil!,¡± before adapting the crowd¡¯s ¡°USA¡± chant into ¡°Jew-s-a,¡± all the while continuing to scream at the members of the media in the press pen. 
Candace Smith, of ABC, was one of the reporters to capture the man¡¯s disturbing behavior on tape. She posted video of the disturbing press area encounter to Twitter, a video which is featured below. This is the man who started chanting ¡°JEW-S-A¡± at the media pen. Does anyone know what those hands signs mean? pic.twitter.com/64yseZFSVZ 
¡ª Candace Smith (@CandaceSmith_) October 29, 2016 
Smith included in the text accompanying her video post a question, saying in reference to seemingly intentional hand gestures on the part of the Trump supporter, ¡°Does anyone know what those hand signs mean?¡± 
Smith got at least a couple noteworthy and credible responses. 
Clayton Swisher, whose Twitter bio reads that he is an ¡°investigative reporter and author,¡± suggested that the Trump supporter¡¯s hand gestures are a variation of the ¡°88¡± hand sign used by white supremacists and described by the Anti-Defamation League as follows: 
¡®One of the most popular white supremacist symbols is the numeric symbol 88, which stands for ¡°Heil Hitler¡± (substituting letters for numbers, 88 means HH, i.e., ¡°Heil Hitler¡±). It is thus not surprising that white supremacists occasionally attempt to display 88 as a hand sign.¡¯ 
¡ª Clayton Swisher (@claytonswisher) October 30, 2016 
A Twitter user identified as Marisel Morales suggested that the hand gestures were the ¡°Scwhurhand,¡± which is a German salute used in court. @CandaceSmith_ It's a German salute known as Schwurhand 
¡ª Marisel Morales (@57MCM) October 29, 2016 
A Twitter user with the username ¡°@puppymnkey¡± countered, however, that the Trump supporter¡¯s hand gestures didn¡¯t quite match the Schwurhand, and instead pointed to a hand gesture version of the number ¡°666¡± employed by conspiracy theorists, a group almost certainly the man at the Trump rally. @57MCM @CandaceSmith_ nope.

Nick Corasaniti of The New York Times was another member of the press to capture the man¡¯s disturbing behavior on film.

Donald Trump wants so-called ¡°poll watchers¡± to scare people into not voting? Fine, then Arizona Democrats will sue their state GOP¡¯s sorry ass¡­ And they¡¯ve got a good chance of winning. 
The U.S. Supreme Court¡¯s gutting of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 was a huge win for the Republican Party. Since high voter turnout ¡ª especially high minority voter turnout ¡ª creates victories for Democrats, it makes sense for the GOP to keep as many people from voting as they possibly can. There¡¯s just one thing the party of Donald Trump forgot: Voters still do have some rights, and the GOP doesn¡¯t get to do whatever the hell it wants. 
Donald Trump¡¯s calls for ¡°poll watchers¡± to prevent nonexistent ¡°voter fraud¡± may land the Republican Party in some serious hot water. AZ Central reports the Democratic Party of Arizona filed a lawsuit and seeks a court order banning Mein Trumpf¡¯s bands of brown shirts from the polling places. 
¡®The suit filed in federal court in Phoenix Monday seeks an order blocking volunteer GOP poll watchers from harassing or photographing people headed to polling locations. The suit says the state Republican Party is essentially an arm of Trump¡¯s campaign and the campaign and its backers have been organizing ¡°citizen journalists¡± and ¡°poll watchers¡± to flood minority-heavy polling sites on Nov. 8.¡¯ 
And despite the demise of key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, they¡¯ve still got some ammo. Last week, Rachel Maddow talked about something the GOP forgot about: That pesky old legal consent decree. Back in 1981, the Republican National Committee (RNC) employed similar ¡°poll watcher¡± tactics during a tight governor race in New Jersey. Their ¡°Ballot Security Task Force¡± employed heavy-handed tactics in minority districts and won the race for their candidate by a razor thin margin. 
Unfortunately, the GOP¡¯s short-term win backfired and had long-term consequences: a 35-year consent decree that puts strong limits on their ¡°poll watching¡± activities. These legal restrictions don¡¯t expire until next year. Naturally, Donald Trump¡¯s renewed call for ¡°poll watchers¡± has triggered concerns on the part of DNC lawyers at the national level. Now, they¡¯re demanding that the courts extend the consent decree through 2025. Watch: Rachel Maddow explains how Trump¡¯s call for ¡°poll watchers¡± is causing legal trouble for the RNC. 
Of course, Tim Sifert, the state¡¯s GOP spokesman, insists these poll watchers aren¡¯t trying to intimidate voters. They¡¯re just helping ¡°monitor¡± polling places since ¡ª thanks to SCOTUS ¡ª we no longer have as many actual monitors for U.S. elections. But, as POLITICO points out, there¡¯s a huge difference between having impartial observers around to provide advice and support for voters and poll workers and having ¡°poll watchers¡± spreading misinformation and scaring voters. 
¡®Trump seems to be advocating for a type of election monitoring that relies on volunteers to use deceptive practices that are often used to prevent people of color from voting. Voter suppression has changed since the era of literacy tests and poll taxes. In 2016, suppression occurs in two distinct stages: one before the election, and one at the polling locations themselves.¡¯ 
The POLITICO article explains how the GOP tries to scare people into not voting in two stages. Stage 1: Before an election, Republicans try to keep people from casting their ballots with false ¡ª and sometimes scary ¡ª information. In 2008, mailers went out telling Democratic voters in Virginia that Election Day had been moved from Tuesday to Wednesday. Meanwhile, black neighborhoods in Milwaukee (2004) and Philadelphia (2008) got plastered with flyers warning that people with unpaid child support and parking tickets might get arrested when they show up to vote. Stage 2: On election day, so-called ¡°poll watchers¡± ¡ª often with fake badges and IDs that make them look like they¡¯re in positions of authority ¡ª single out non-white voters with demands for ID and questions about their citizenship. They also often scare off eligible voters by taking photos and video footage (which sounds innocuous unless you happen to be among the roughly 7.5 million people being stalked each year). 
And, let¡¯s not forget ¡ª here¡¯s what ¡°poll watchers¡± looked like during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era.

Social Security is the lifeline of many people who are either too elderly or disabled to support themselves or their loved ones financially. However, to Republicans and conservatives alike, it is an expenditure deemed too costly, even if it means certain death for those who depend on it. 
Forget for a moment that elderly people who worked their entire lives have paid into social security, and should therefore be completely off limits. How could anyone with a soul leave the elderly to die in poverty? And what about those people who are physically and/or mentally disabled? Should we, as a nation, not take care of those citizens? Should we leave them to survive on the streets? 
Donald Trump is not known to do much critical thinking, especially before releasing a statement to the media, but his insane remarks on cutting Social Security have really got liberals fuming. Check out that time Trump told Paul Ryan that he would love to cut Social Security if he didn¡¯t think it would be political suicide: 
¡°From a moral standpoint, I believe in it. But you also have to get elected. And there¡¯s no way a Republican is going to beat a Democrat when the Republican is saying, ¡®We¡¯re going to cut your Social Security¡¯ and the Democrat is saying, ¡®We¡¯re going to keep it and give you more.¡¯?¡± 
Trump is really trying to say that the lazy people in this country will always vote Democrat because it is Democrats who ensure that the less fortunate are, at least, able to keep their heads above water. To politicians like Donald Trump, these ¡°extras¡± are killing the country. 
That¡¯s right folks, it¡¯s Ma and Pa Kettle who are ruining the country with their $1200 monthly allotment from the Treasury Department. It certainly wouldn¡¯t be wasteful, greedy real estate moguls who use other people¡¯s money to pay for their extravagant business deals. 
Alex Lawson is the Executive Director of Social Security Works, and he has a much different theory on Trump¡¯s motives with Social Security. Lawson had this to say about it: 
¡°It is really clear: Donald Trump would 100 percent go along with the Republican donor class position of cutting Social Security. He openly says he will lie to the people about it because he knows that the people are against it.¡± 
¡°In his eyes the ¡®moral¡¯ thing to do is to steal people¡¯s hard-earned benefits and not talk about it.¡± 
As we have learned throughout this election season, Donald Trump almost never tells the truth. Yet, he still convinces his mindless followers that he would somehow be good for America, regardless of the fact that there is nothing but evidence to prove the opposite. Trump won¡¯t be happy until our grandparents are living in squalor and eating ramen for every meal.

WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange¡¯s lawyers have suggested that the globally detested, thorn in the side social figure will keep at, and even perhaps intensify, efforts to be fully pardoned by the United States once President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year. 
Assange¡¯s lawyers made the announcement after the controversial global ¡°whistleblower¡± spoke with Swedish authorities who had come to consult with him within the neutral territory of the Ecuadorian embassy in the U.K. over rape charges which Assange faces in Sweden. 
Assange has been holed up in the aforementioned embassy for years in an effort to escape facing the diverse set of global charges which have been lobbed against him. 
And, as for a pivoted effort for Assange to escape the charges he faces, one directed at attempting to garner a Trump signed, U.S. presidential pardon, Assange¡¯s lawyers said, according to London¡¯s Evening Standard , ¡°Through U.S. counsel, we had reached out to the Obama administration, most recently just a few months ago, and we will continue to do so with future U.S. administrations until the investigation is closed.¡± 
These efforts at a presidential pardon for Assange began, as noted, under the Obama administration, but with Obama¡¯s own federal appointments and the soon to be former president himself as the ones to ever begin an investigation into Assange in the first place, efforts for an Obama pardon of Assange unsurprisingly never got anywhere. 
The U.S. investigation was first prompted by Assange¡¯s publication of classified documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan delivered to him by Army whistleblower Bradley/Chelsea Manning ¡ª who, mind you, is still in American custody and doesn¡¯t seem to have much of a hope of release anytime soon. 
Assange¡¯s more recent work, during the lead up to Election Day, quickly turned into an elaborate anti-Clinton campaign, one viewed by American intelligence officials as backed by the Russian government in the interest of seeing their preferred candidate ¡ª Trump ¡ª elected to the presidency. 
WikiLeaks published in this time frame a huge cache of emails hacked from key members of the Democratic Party leadership and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, targeting figures from the now former party chairperson and U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. WikiLeaks also released many thousands of emails taken from Clinton¡¯s tenure as secretary of state serving under President Obama. 
The credibility of the emails has been occasionally questioned. Indeed, even if the organization only received and hacked actual emails and the like that had actually come from Democratic Party officials. WikiLeaks was still found, on multiple occasions, to have been improperly spinning the email contents. Such as the time a mundane email about then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton¡¯s UN translation providing earpiece, was spun into a fake story about Clinton using an earpiece to be fed what she was supposed to say. 
Trump is far from predictable enough for any observer to definitively suggest his course of action regarding Assange once he takes office.

On Saturday, during a ceremony welcoming 17 new cardinals into the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis warned attendees about the divisiveness that he feels is spreading throughout the church. The Associated Press reports that Pope Francis cautioned against the ¡°virus of polarization,¡± telling the new group of cardinals, ¡°we are not immune from this.¡± 
During his speech, Pope Francis specifically issued a warning about ¡°our pitiful hearts that tend to judge, divide, oppose, and condemn¡± and those who ¡°raise walls, build barriers, and label people.¡± He also encouraged those in attendance to not be so quick to deem those who are different from them an enemy or a threat. 
¡®We see, for example, how quickly those among us with the status of the stranger, an immigrant, or a refugee, become a threat, take on the status of an enemy. An enemy because they come from a distant country, or have different customs. 
¡®The virus of polarization and animosity permeates our way of thinking, feeling and acting.¡¯ 
Pope Francis never called out Donald Trump by name; however, it seems to be more than a mere coincidence that he delivered a speech about accepting immigrants shortly after the United States electorate chose as their leader for the next four years a man who has proposed mass deportation and the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. 
This is not the first time that the Pope has spoken out against Donald Trump and his campaign promises, either. In February of this year, when asked about Trump¡¯s proposed border wall, he said , ¡°a person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.¡± 
At least one of the newly appointed cardinals has views similar to Pope Francis¡¯s when it comes to immigration. Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin, who was in the news recently for helping to resettle Syrian refugees despite now vice president-elect Mike Pence¡¯s best efforts to block aid to and limit the number of Syrian refugees in Indiana. 
Tobin recently addressed Trump¡¯s victory, saying that, under him, the priority of settling immigrants and refugees ¡°is going to be challenging.¡± He added, though, that he believes ¡°the ethical reflection of a nation isn¡¯t reduced to the government¡± and said that he has ¡°a lot of faith in the American people.¡±

The ACLU has got a few words for America¡¯s newest elected ¡°leader,¡± and the letter they just published through the NY Times, is probably the most amazing jab in the history of politics. It doesn¡¯t hurt that the jab came from the American Civil Liberties Union, because the power behind the letter is what makes it so ominous to the president-elect. 
The letter begins with a request for Trump to ¡°change course¡± on many of the claims he has made in his extremely short political career. 
¡°Dear President-Elect Trump, 
For nearly 100 years, the ACLU has stood as this nation¡¯s premier defender of freedom and justice for all. 
As you assume the nation¡¯s highest office, we must ask you now as president-elect to reconsider and change course on certain campaign promises you have made. 
Specifically, you promised to: amass deportation force to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants ban the entry of Muslims and institute aggressive surveillance programs targeting them restrict a woman¡¯s right to abortion services reauthorize waterboarding and other forms of torture change our nation¡¯s libel laws and restrict freedom of expression¡± 
As if this statement alone wasn¡¯t enough of a threat, the ACLU continues: 
¡°These proposals are not simply un-American and wrong-headed. They are unlawful and unconstitutional, and would violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, as well as other statutes and international treaties.¡± 
¡°Many of our country¡¯s most cherished rights are the result of ACLU litigation and advocacy. They include the Scopes trial (the right to teach evolution in public science classrooms) and the following Supreme Court cases: Korematsu (challenging Japanese American internment); Miranda (the right to remain silent); Griswold (the right to contraception); Loving (the right of interracial couples to marry); Gideon (the right to a court-appointed attorney if you can¡¯t afford one); Windsor (striking down the federal Defense of Marriage Act); and Obergefell (the right of same-sex couples to marry) and others. We have worked with and battled American presidents of both parties to ensure that our country makes good on it¡¯s founding premise as the land of the free.¡± 
In the end of the open letter, the ACLU promises to make Trump¡¯s life a nightmare if he continues to pave his road to concentration camp hell. They say Trump will have the full firepower of the ACLU to deal with if he doesn¡¯t wise up. 
They letter concludes: 
¡°If you do not reverse course and endeavor to make these campaign promises a reality, you will have to contend with the full firepower of the ACLU at your every step. Our staff of litigators and activists in every state, thousands of volunteers, and millions of supporters stand ready to fight against any encroachment on our cherished freedoms and rights.¡± 
¡°One thing is certain: We will be vigilant every day of your tenure as president. And when you ultimately vacate the Oval Office, we will do likewise with your successor.¡± Today we published a full-page open letter in the New York Times to President-elect Trump pic.twitter.com/FOpRqn9oNY

A source at MSNBC¡¯s Morning Joe confirms that the newly-elected Trump has made a decision regarding Hillary Clinton¡¯s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Source tells @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump won¡¯t pursue investigations into @HillaryClinton for private email server use/Clinton Foundation. 
¡ª Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) November 22, 2016 
Despite all his campaign bluster, when he was calling Clinton ¡°crooked Hillary¡± and promising that Clinton would ¡°be in jail¡± once he was president, it seems Trump has had a change of heart. It seems like only a month ago that Donald Trump told his supporters that: 
¡®This is the most heinous, the most serious thing that I¡¯ve ever seen involving justice in the United States ¡ª in the history of the United States.¡¯ 
In fact, it was only a month ago. Trump promised his bloodthirsty supporters that he would ¡°lock her up¡± as president, and just six weeks ago Trump promised during the second presidential debate that he would appoint a ¡°special prosecutor¡± to look into Hillary Clinton¡¯s ¡°situation¡± regarding her use of a private email server. 
Five days after being elected, Trump did one of the most rapid walkbacks in presidential history when asked about that ¡°special prosecutor¡± to throw Hillary Clinton in prison. When asked by 60 Minutes interviewer, Lesley Stahl, about his plans for the former secretary of state, Trump balked. 
¡®I don¡¯t want to hurt them. I don¡¯t want to hurt them. They¡¯re, they¡¯re good people. I don¡¯t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.¡¯ 
The same man who fanned the flames with supporters who called Clinton a ¡°criminal¡± and ¡°evil,¡± who exploited women who claimed that they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and laughed at as a child rape victim by Hillary Clinton, now wants the American public to know that Bill and Hillary Clinton are ¡°good people.¡± 
Of course, it was never in question whether or not Hillary Clinton would be convicted of a crime or sentenced to prison, since multiple investigations by GOP-led committees regarding Benghazi and two investigations by the FBI regarding the private email server that Clinton and every modern predecessor of hers used turned up no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. 
Just like every other promise Trump made on the campaign trail to attract voters with vengeance and hatred on their minds, it was all just smoke and mirrors.

When astute political commentary from a half century ago eloquently describes the current political conundrum it means we¡¯ve been stuck in a bad place for a long time. Do we really want Malcolm¡¯s observation to apply four or eight or twenty years further into the future? Malcolm X on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by Bruce A. Dixon 
It¡¯s that time again, it¡¯s presidential election season, and as we hear every four years, THIS is the most important presidential election of our lives. The fact that you¡¯ve heard that before should tell us something. It should us that in presidential years, many old things becomes new again, often because so much of what we¡¯re told IS new is really pretty old. 
Malcolm X has been dead now a half century, dead for more years than he was ever alive. But since at least one of the tricks and traps deployed to fool, frustrate and neutralize our grandparents¡¯ right to vote hasn¡¯t changed much we might want to listen carefully to what Malcolm¡¯s words in the aftermath of the 1964 presidential election. 
¡° If Johnson had been running all by himself, he would not have been acceptable to anyone. The only thing that made him acceptable to the world was that the shrewd capitalists, the shrewd imperialists, knew that the only way people would run toward the fox would be if you showed them a wolf. So they created a ghastly alternative. And it had the whole world ¡ª including people who call themselves Marxists ¡ª hoping that Johnson would beat Goldwater.¡± 
Like today¡¯s Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was a truly reprehensible and frightening figure, who had opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination in public accommodations, and who favored the use of nuclear weapons to defoliate the Vietnamese countryside. Also like Donald Trump, Goldwater never really stood a chance of winning the election. Goldwater the wolf was buried beneath a Johnson landslide, carrying only 6 out of the 50 states. Republican officeholders are running away from Donald Trump not because he¡¯s a racist bufoon but because he¡¯s expected to lose states Republicans are accustomed to winning. 
The fox, Lyndon Baines Johnson went on to start a war in Indochina that killed three million Vietnamese alone. LBJ defoliated the Vietnamese countryside with millions of tons of Agent Orange instead of nukes, causing hundreds of thousands of hideous and gruesome birth defects that continue to this day. 
The wolf and the fox this year are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Trump is a real estate con man, a racist and a hyper-entitled sexual predator who talks about building walls and banning Muslims. Fortunately for us all, Trump has never been in government. Hillary has scarcely ever been out of government. She¡¯s fronted for Wal-Mart, executed bloody regime change in Libya, brought US troops to Ukraine on the Russian border, and publicly itches for a showdown in Syria. Thanks to Wikileaks there is copious evidence that Hillary¡¯s public stands on a wide range of issues from charter schools to so-called trade agreements, to fracking and social security stand in stark contrast to the promises she makes to the powerful. 
Just as it worked 52 years ago, the overwhelming defeat of her wolvish opponent will give Hillary the appearance of a mandate. But the margin of Hillary¡¯s victory provides those of us on the left an unprecedented opportunity. It means there is no need for those who imagine themselves on the of jobs, justice, peace and the planet to ride to Hilllary¡¯s rescue and ensure the defeat of Donald Trump. Trump has already beaten himself. 
This election is our best chance to break out of the decades-old two party trap and build a new political force, a new political party. The Green Party is the only peace party, the only party that stands for people and planet over profit, and our only opportunity to vote our hopes, not our fears. It¡¯s time to choose. 
We vote Green and build Green, we can consign the political conundrum Malcolm X eloquently described a half century ago to the garbage can of history. Or we can vote for Hillary, and Malcolm¡¯s words will be as applicable four or eight years or twenty years from now as they have been for the last fifty. For Black Agenda Radio I¡¯m Bruce Dixon.

President Donald Trump? How did such a thing happen? A competent and purposeful Clinton campaign should have beaten Donald Trump. How did Hillary Clinton and one-percenter Democrats snatch defeat from the jaws of certain victory? America Might Not Deserve Trump, But Dems and Hillary Deserved To Lose by BAR managing editor Bruce A. Dixon 
It¡¯s over. The crotch-grabbing racist con man beat the lying corporate warmonger. Donald Trump is president-elect of the US. 
It didn¡¯t have to happen that way. Trump¡¯s winning 58 million votes were a hair fewer than Clinton¡¯s popular vote, a million or two less than Republican losers McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012, six and ten million behind Obama¡¯s 2012 and 2008 numbers. The buffoonish Trump was elected with such a low turnout because Hillary Clinton¡¯s campaign was even less competent and credible. To borrow the condescending language Barack Obama deploys before black audiences, Hillary¡¯s campaign never gave Cousin Pookie much reason to get up off the couch and vote. 
Republican and Democratic parties are alike owned by their one-percenter investor/contributors. Democratic party shot callers decided they¡¯d risk losing with Hillary Clinton rather than winning with Bernie Sanders. So Democratic party leadership, their media allies and the entire black political class got behind Hillary Clinton and helped collude and conspire to eliminate VT Senator Bernie Sanders, the Democrat with the best chance against any Republican opponent. 
Once Bernie Sanders was eliminated Hillary waged a lazy and ineffective campaign, playing a hand with just three cards. 
The first was the broken record of how unthinkable and unprecedented a disaster a Trump presidency would be¡­ a clownish sexual predator who pronounced climate change a hoax and would criminalize abortion, open concentration camps, repeal Obamacare, legalize stop and frisk, build a wall, appoint neanderthals to the Supreme Court, deport six or ten million immigrants instead of Obama¡¯s paltry two million and who might be in hock to the Russians. Except for the thing about the Russians, it¡¯s roughly the same picture Democrats have drawn of every Republican presidential candidate since Nixon. A story told that many times just gets old. Party leaders counted on it anyway, and it wasn¡¯t enough. That was incompetence. 
A second and relatively weak card Democrats played was conjuring up an Imaginary Hillary Clinton, a defender of womens¡¯ and human rights who held hands with the moms of killer cop victims, and occasionally mumbled about black lives mattering and the need to reform the criminal justice system. But Hillary¡¯s decades-long record as a tool of banksters, billionaires and one-percenters was so well established in the public mind that Imaginary Hillary was a difficult sell, not credible. 
The one-percenter Democrats¡¯ third card, on which they staked a lot was the early and unconditional endorsement of Hillary Clinton by   and Michelle. This had proven effective in Chicago in 2011 and 2015 where Obama¡¯s blessings in 2011 and 2015 were key to fastening Rahm Emanuel on the city¡¯s jugular vein after a half century of Daley rule. The entire black political class got behind Hillary too, from civil rights icons who ruminated on how they hadn¡¯t seen Bernie Sanders back in the day to some other wise heads who assured us a vote for the Green Party¡¯s Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka was an act of ¡° narcissism ¡± or maybe white privilege . But at the end of  ¡¯s time in office, the Obama endorsement didn¡¯t carry the clout it used to. 
Thanks to two generations of lazy Democrats who refused to try to consolidate the victory of the 1965 Voting Rights Act the Supreme Court in 2013 nullified its key provisions, enabling a constellation of laws and practices aimed at limiting access to the ballot on the part of students, minorities, the elderly and constituencies likely to vote Democratic. In the 2016 election cycle these practices stripped another few million Democratic voters from the rolls. 
All in all, Democrats were the authors of their own defeat this presidential election. Hillary couldn¡¯t campaign against the one percent because her party is a party of the one percent. Hillary Democrats including Bernie himself after the convention could no longer acknowledge joblessness, low wages, lack of housing, permanent war or the high cost of medical care or they¡¯d be campaigning against themselves. 
Donald Trump didn¡¯t win because of some mysterious upsurge of racism and nativism. He won because Hillary Clinton¡¯s campaign was even less inspiring and less competent than his own, and worked hard to snatch its own defeat from the jaws of victory.

The crisis that has enveloped U.S. imperialism, under both Republican and Democratic rule, rocked the corporate duopoly system and opened the door for Donald Trump's ascension to power. Decades ago, ¡°the Republicans became the White Man¡¯s Party while the Democrats neutralized the left.¡± Trump is the result. ¡°A genuine, radical left with any vision at all would not tremble before a Donald Trump Administration or mourn a Clinton loss.¡± System Breakdown: Trump's Chickens Come Home to Roost by Danny Haiphong 
¡°The left can no longer afford to suppress the material struggle for liberation in place of a rhetorical struggle against racism.¡± 
A number of people dropped their jaw in fear after Trump's victory in the 2016 elections. My jaw dropped for a different reason. Trump's victory occurred without the support of the ruling class. Most of his supporters came from the disaffected white working class and petit bourgeoisie (think ""small"" business). The Trump victory is thus a monumental moment in US history. The two-party corporate duopoly could not have drawn a worse hand and the ruling class has settled with Trump out of sheer limitation. US imperialism is in a state of system breakdown. The chickens have come home to roost. 
So how did Trump win? For one, Trump's legions were the only section of the voting age population energized to vote. As BAR's Bruce Dixon has noted , voter suppression has been a common practice in most states for decades. This combined with nearly four decades of capitalist crisis has placed the US political system in a dead-end situation. The Democratic Party has become the truest expression of the ruling capitalist class over this period. It instituted the trade deals, wars, austerity policies, and expanded the police and prison forces necessary to maintain the rule of capitalism in decline. The material conditions of the crisis these policies set into motion ultimately opened the door for Trump's chickens to come home to roost. 
¡°US imperialism is in a state of system breakdown.¡± 
Trump's base is on the move namely to resurrect more favorable economic conditions, historically distributed on a racial basis, of a prior stage of capitalism. War on behalf of industrial capital once distributed income and wealth more favorably to a larger portion of whites. Capitalist decline has forever changed these conditions. The Democratic Party and Republican Party are both responsible for the current conditions of depravity, racism, and neo-liberal psychosis that currently plagues US society. Starting in the 1970s, the Republicans became the White Man¡¯s Party while the Democrats neutralized the left. Four decades of two-party misery greatly influenced the outcome of the 2016 elections. 
What is striking about Trump's base is how it was able to compel the Electoral College to betray the wishes of the ruling class. During the Democratic primary, delegates were more than happy to abandon popular will in favor of Clinton. But much has changed since the Democratic Party suppressed the Sanders campaign. WikiLeaks exposed the many crimes of Hillary Clinton. Although Clinton won the popular vote, many Black, Latino, union, and women voters decided not to opt for her as President. Those that did held their nose and were thus seen as less of a threat to the ruling class than the possibility of a dejected Trump base. 
¡° The Democratic Party and Republican Party are both responsible for the current conditions of depravity, racism, and neo-liberal psychosis that currently plagues US society.¡± 
The left in the US must come to terms with reality. It has spent decades trailing behind the crisis of imperialism by throwing its full support to the Democratic Party appendage of the ruling class. So-called white liberals in particular ridiculed the supposedly backward character of white workers and acted as if they possessed an anti-racist bone in their own bodies. The liberal-left as a whole bound themselves to the party of dead-end capitalism in order to avoid the party of the White Man. It was only a matter of time before the two-party corporate duopoly would rupture under the weight of its own contradictions. 
The Trump Administration is thus a logical conclusion of, and not a resolution to, the contradictions of imperialism. The left must now confront what it has avoided for too long. Never has it been clearer that Trump is the logical conclusion to the misery of life under US imperialism. The Democrats overplayed their hand, thinking that rhetoric alone could maintain its false image as the ""left"" wing of the two-party system. Yet even though the Democrats have consistently betrayed their base on behalf of the ruling class, millions of Clinton supporters are in a state of mourning over her loss. 
¡°The liberal-left as a whole bound themselves to the party of dead-end capitalism in order to avoid the party of the White Man.¡± 
A genuine, radical left with any vision at all would not tremble before the feet of a Donald Trump Administration or mourn a Clinton loss. The left must explore the many facets of the Trump development. It must no longer ignore the white workers and petty bourgeois Trump supporters that have brought real material demands to the fore. The left can no longer afford to suppress the material struggle for liberation in place of a rhetorical struggle against racism. The ruling class is in disarray and the Trump victory proves it. 
A Trump Presidency won't be a simple trip to the apocalypse. Even with a majority in the House and the Senate, the Republican Party must now choose to align itself to Trumpist politics or continue to collaborate with the Democratic Party to destroy him. There is no doubt that Wall Street, the military industrial complex, and the rest of the bourgeoisie will attempt to control the unpredictable white nationalist billionaire. The New York Times has already made overtures about a ""conflict of interest"" between his business investments and his newfound political position. Of course, the Times never had an issue with Obama when he bailed out Wall Street or chose his cabinet from a list provided by Citigroup. 
¡° The left must take advantage of the internal squabbling among the ruling class that is surely to come.¡± 
Trump is no Wall Street politician so he will inevitably face many contradictions while in office. Will he respect his base's wishes to build mutual ties with Russia and rollback NATO? Will he keep his promise to rid of NAFTA and the TPP? Or will he capitulate to the ruling class, angering his base and potentially setting up an early grave for his Administration? And what will the bourgeoisie do should they not be able to control him? All of these questions must be asked. The left must take advantage of the internal squabbling among the ruling class that is surely to come. Conditions remain favorable to organize a truly radical, left political agenda for social transformation. 
The ruling class will attempt to neutralize the left by controlling Trump¡¯s agenda and simultaneously piecing together the Democratic Party for the 2020 elections. It remains to be seen whether this will effectively save the system from collapse. Because the truth is, Trump is not a reflection of some American apocalypse. His victory is a product of system breakdown. Over the next four years, it would serve the left well to defeat any possibility of a Democratic Party resurrection so a true party of the people can arise in this moment of opportunity.

Donald Trump¡¯s many evils are manifest and obvious. But let¡¯s stop pretending that some historical line has been crossed in U.S. political and social relations. ¡°The dictates of white supremacy are ever present and the numbers of white people who do anything serious about it are small.¡± Newly outraged Democrats act like they¡¯ve never seen a fascist. ¡°There is an ample supply of domestic fascists. They are the people who wear police uniforms.¡± Freedom Rider : How Not to Protest Trump by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
¡° There are many unique characteristics to the Donald Trump story but the institutional evils that permeate this country persist no matter who sits in the oval office. ¡± 
Thousands of progressives are taking to the streets in opposition to the Donald Trump presidency. After eight years of Obama induced slumber they awoke with quite a start. Many of these individuals and organizations protested as part of the anti-war, Occupy and Black Lives Matter movements, but others weren¡¯t concerned about very much until the reality show host became president elect. 
The awful Hillary Clinton should be inaugurated the 45 th president of the United States because she won the popular vote. But for the second time in less than twenty years a Democrat preferred by the people will instead be an historical footnote. If nothing else the Electoral College is rightly condemned. 
But where else should protesters direct their anger? If they are concerned about fascism they could protest police killings, or United States government murders committed during numerous interventions abroad. They might have risen up against the mass incarceration state. The list of outrages that should get people moving is quite long. 
White liberals here in New York City didn¡¯t care very much when black and brown residents were subjected to nearly one million police encounters. Mayor Bloomberg¡¯s infamous stop and frisk program was a tailor made opportunity for public anger. Yet every poll indicated that white people were in favor of this very fascist 21 st century slave patrol. Those same people are now upset but what exactly has raised their ire? 
¡°Trump is no more hostile to the rights of the press than Obama was.¡± 
They say they are concerned about the rights of undocumented people but they didn¡¯t say much when Obama acted as the Deporter-in-Chief. The so-called Muslim registry of men from 25 countries under the auspices of the NSEERS program lasted from 2002 to 2011. That is to say during two years of the Obama administration. They may be concerned about climate change and Trump¡¯s promise to end America¡¯s participation in the most recent climate agreement. But that agreement allows for a rise in carbon production and thus in world temperatures. They would have been smarter to challenge the phony climate change process itself. 
They say they are afraid that Trump will muzzle the press. His shouting match with network executives should not be a cause for alarm. Eventually they¡¯ll start saying good things about him so he was foolish to be so hostile. But he is no more hostile to the rights of the press than Obama was. When he used the Espionage Act to punish leakers and whistle blowers many of the now distraught progressives didn¡¯t say much. 
So what has gotten progressives so angry? There is nothing new about the so-called alt-right movement. There is always a way to brand white nationalism. They may be the Tea Party one day and alt-right the next but it all amounts to the same thing. The dictates of white supremacy are ever present and the numbers of white people who do anything serious about it are small. 
If the sight of naziesque salutes to Trump are upsetting just keep in mind that there is an ample supply of domestic fascists. They are the people who wear police uniforms. They may not ¡°hail Trump¡± or anyone else but they kill three people in this country every day. 
¡° Barack Obama and Eric Holder quite literally kept thousands of black people in jail who could have been freed.¡± 
Donald Trump should be given credit for providing so much low hanging fruit. His appointment of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions to the post of attorney general provides ready made ingredients for fear and anger. Sessions was once denied a federal judgeship in part because of racist remarks directed at a black attorney. And who can ignore the glorification of the Confederacy in his name. But what did Obama and his two black attorney generals do? There were no prosecutions of killer police. That fact is a curious one in the age of murder caught on video. The Obama Justice Department argued against giving the right to request resentencing for those convicted during the years of draconian drug crime prosecution. Barack Obama and Eric Holder quite literally kept thousands of black people in jail who could have been freed. 
It is difficult to take protesters seriously when they won¡¯t even direct their anger at the party which displayed such gross incompetence during the recent campaign. The inability to defeat the man who seemed so unsuited to the presidency should stir anger towards the people whose hubris brought him to the White House. 
There is always a need to engage in struggle, whether a Republican or Democrat is president. There are many unique characteristics to the Donald Trump story but the institutional evils that permeate this country persist no matter who sits in the oval office. We can gauge the true level of concern about justice when a Democrat next emerges victorious. A president who provides a greater opportunity for scorn should not be the last one who faces opposition.

Fears of Trump should not obscure the fact that Barack Obama¡¯s reign was a disaster. ¡°Black America is in a worse condition than before, working class people as a whole have lost ground to a low-wage economy, and the world is closer to a World War III scenario than at any point prior.¡± The struggle continues, but ¡°it is important to ensure that the protests against Trump are not allowed to be channeled back into the Democratic Party graveyard.¡± Obama's Departure is One Reason to Feel Optimism for Trump's Arrival by Danny Haiphong 
¡°Only gridlock saved Social Security and Medicare from being privatized during his Presidency.¡± 
Thousands have taken to the streets across the country to protest Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 elections. The protests have mainly centered on Trump's racism, sexism, and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric spewed during his campaign. Protesters have yet to wrestle with Trump's positions on foreign policy and trade that made him a pariah to the majority of the ruling class. The struggle against capitalism and imperialism in the US remains immature even in the midst of positive growth in the movement against police brutality and racism in recent years. While Trump's overt bigotry gives cause for protest, there is one benefit of the Trump moment that should not be understated. That benefit is the much needed conclusion of the Obama era. 
Democrats across the US are in a state of mourning over the departure of Obama. Democrats heralded Obama as the quintessential professional and consummate politician. His celebrity was peppered by the appearance of intelligence and rationality in the face of so-called Republican ""obstructionism."" Obama's rule was advertised as a victory for the Black Freedom movement. His Administration possessed a vast marketing apparatus that defended him as the lesser-evil alternative to the racist vitriol of the White Man's Republican Party. 
¡°Obama's rule was advertised as a victory for the Black Freedom movement.¡± 
Black Agenda Report was one of the few on the left that warned of the dangers of Obama in 2008. Once elected, Obama became virtually untouchable. Criticisms of his policies were condemned as racist and insensitive to the needs of Black America. The needs of Black America and the entire left for that matter suddenly became aligned with whatever Obama did. Obama moved forward to protect the banks, escalate war, and erect the largest national security state ever assembled. He instantly became the austerity President, waging a war of privatization on public education with the expressed plans to do the same to Social Security. Only gridlock saved Social Security and Medicare from being privatized during his Presidency. 
The full scope of Obama's legacy has been discussed in earlier issues and will not be analyzed here. What is important is that the left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism. No longer will the left be able to fall back on the first Black President to sanitize his record. Obama's immigration policies deported nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants with little protest. His Administration painted itself as a friend of women and LGBTQ identified people despite the fact that his policy of proxy and drone warfare murdered tens of thousands of women and children in Yemen, Syria, Libya, and Honduras. 
¡°The left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism.¡± 
Obama was able to conduct a greater assault on oppressed people than the prior Bush Administration, making him the most effective evil Wall Street could buy. Obama took over as President in a period where the US was mired in two unpopular occupations abroad and an economic crisis at home. These conditions prompted the ruling class to choose Obama as the required form of counterinsurgency necessary to crush resistance before it started. After making a number of promises to end ""dumb wars"" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class. Eight years later, Black America is in a worse condition than before, working class people as a whole have lost ground to a low-wage economy , and the world is closer to a World War III scenario than at any point prior. 
The massive protests to Trump's victory are in part a release of popular energy brought on by the departure of Obama. Unrest began with the formation of the Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter movements. However, neither of these movements articulated Obama's role in creating the conditions for social insurgency and movement. The 2016 elections changed the landscape dramatically. The Sanders and Trump campaigns set millions into motion in protest of the two-party establishment. Obama's departure will be another breath of fresh air into the internal rot of the imperialist system. It is thus important to ensure that the protests against Trump are not allowed to be channeled back into the Democratic Party graveyard. 
¡°After making a number of promises to end ""dumb wars"" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class.¡± 
Obama will leave Trump a set of conditions that he cannot possibly maintain without popular unrest. Obama departs office only inches from World War III with Russia and China. Poverty and wealth inequality worsened under his administration . Not even clever distortions of statistics could hide the large number of workers currently unemployed or underemployed in the low-wage economy. School closures, food stamp cuts, and bank bailouts have unleashed the neo-liberal wasteland that Trump spoke about in his campaign. 
It appears early on that the left has rejected the viability of Trump's calls to regulate the banks and renegotiate trade deals in favor of working people. Many have ignored Trump¡¯s ¡°populist¡± rhetoric and have focused all the energy of resistance on his white supremacist proposals to ban Muslims and deport millions of undocumented people. However, this moment is just as much about Obama's departure as it is Trump's arrival. The US imperialist system is facing multiple crises that relate directly back to the economic stagnation of global capitalism. It would be a mistake not to demand Trump stay true to his ¡°populism¡± just as it was a mistake when the left failed to demand Obama stay true to his promises. Whatever the case, the departure of Obama is a welcome site, and the left should use the room afforded by it to wage an intensified effort to build the organizational basis for social revolution in our time.

The author writes: ¡°I am not suggesting that white racism alone explains Trump¡¯s victory. Nor am I dismissing the white working class¡¯s very real economic grievances. It is not a matter of disaffection versus racism or sexism versus fear. Rather, racism, class anxieties, and prevailing gender ideologies operate together, inseparably, or as Kimberl¨¦ Crenshaw would say, intersectionally.¡± Trump Says Go Back, We Say Fight Back by Robin D.G. Kelley 
This article previously appeared in Boston Review . 
¡°We need to reject a thoroughly bankrupt Democratic Party leadership that is calling for conciliation and, in Obama¡¯s words, ¡°rooting for [Trump¡¯s] success.¡± 
¡°If we are to keep the enormity of the forces aligned against us from establishing a false hierarchy of oppression, we must school ourselves to recognize that any attack against Blacks, any attack against women, is an attack against all of us who recognize that our interests are not being served by the systems we support. Each one of us here is a link in the connection between antipoor legislation, gay shootings, the burning of synagogues, street harassment, attacks against women, and resurgent violence against Black people.¡± ¡ª Audre Lorde, ¡°Learning from the 60s¡± 
Donald J. Trump¡¯s election was a national trauma, an epic catastrophe that has left millions in the United States and around the world in a state of utter shock, uncertainty, deep depression, and genuine fear. The fear is palpable and justified, especially for those Trump and his acolytes targeted¡ªthe undocumented, Muslims, anyone who ¡°looks¡± undocumented or Muslim, people of color, Jews, the LGBTQ community, the disabled, women, activists of all kinds (especially Black Lives Matter and allied movements resisting state-sanctioned violence), trade unions. . . . the list is long. And the attacks have begun; as I write these words, reports of hate crimes and racist violence are flooding my inbox. 
The common refrain is that no one expected this. (Of course, the truth is that many people did expect this, just not in the elite media.) At no point, this refrain goes, could ¡°we¡± imagine Trump in the Oval office surrounded by a cabinet made up of some of the most idiotic, corrupt, and authoritarian characters in modern day politics¡ªRudolph Giuliani, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, John Bolton, Ben Carson, Jeff Sessions, David ¡°Blue Lives Matter¡± Clarke, Joe Arpaio, to name a few. Meanwhile, paid professional pundits are scrambling to peddle their analyses and to normalize the results¡ªon the same broadcast media that helped deliver Trump¡¯s victory by making him their ratings-boosting spectacle rather than attending to issues, ideas, and other candidates (e.g., Bernie Sanders or Jill Stein). They deliver the same old platitudes: disaffected voters, angry white men who have suffered economically and feel forgotten, Trump¡¯s populist message represented the nation¡¯s deep-seated distrust of Washington, ad infinitum. Some liberal pundits have begun to speak of President-Elect Trump as thoughtful and conciliatory, and some even suggest that his unpredictability may prove to be an asset. The protests are premature or misplaced. All of this from the same folks who predicted a Clinton victory. 
¡°Trump¡¯s followers are attracted to his wealth as metonym of an American dream that they, too, can enjoy once America is ¡®great¡¯ again.¡± 
But the outcome should not have surprised us. This election was, among other things, a referendum on whether the United States will be a straight, white nation reminiscent of the mythic ¡°old days¡± when armed white men ruled, owned their castle, boasted of unvanquished military power, and everyone else knew their place. Henry Giroux¡¯s new book America at War With Itself made this point with clarity and foresight two months before the election. The easy claim that Trump appeals to legitimate working-class populism driven by class anger, Giroux argues, ignores both the historical link between whiteness, citizenship, and humanity, and the American dream of wealth accumulation built on private property. Trump¡¯s followers are not trying to redistribute the wealth, nor are they all ¡°working class¡±¡ªtheir annual median income is about $72,000. On the contrary, they are attracted to Trump¡¯s wealth as metonym of an American dream that they, too, can enjoy once America is ¡°great¡± again¡ªwhich is to say, once the country returns to being ¡°a white MAN¡¯s country.¡± What Giroux identifies as ¡°civic illiteracy¡± keeps them convinced that the descendants of unfree labor or the colonized, or those who are currently unfree, are to blame for America¡¯s decline and for blocking their path to Trump-style success. 
For the white people who voted overwhelmingly for Trump, their candidate embodied the anti-Obama backlash. Pundits who say race was not a factor point to rural, predominantly white counties that went for Obama in 2008 and 2012, but now went for Trump, and to the low black and Latinx voter turnout. However, turnout was down overall, not just among African Americans. Post-election analysis shows that as a percentage of total votes the black vote dropped only 1 percent compared with the 2012 election, even while the number of black ballots counted decreased by nearly 11 percent. (Why this happened is beyond the scope of this essay, but one might begin with Greg Palast¡¯s findings about voter suppression and the use of ¡°crosscheck¡± to invalidate ballots.) Moreover, claims that nearly a third of Latinxs went for Trump have been disputed by the website Latino Decision, whose careful research puts the figure at 18 percent. The turnout does not contradict the fact that Trump drew the clear majority of white votes. This is not startling news. 
¡°We cannot ignore the fact that the vast majority of white men and a majority of white women, across class lines, voted for a platform and a message of white supremacy.¡± 
If history is our guide, ¡°whitelash¡± usually follows periods of expanded racial justice and democratic rights. In the aftermath of Reconstruction, there were many instances in which southern white men switched from the biracial, abolitionist Republicans to the ¡°redeemers,¡± whether it be the Democrats or, in states like Texas, the ¡°White Man¡¯s Party.¡± (No ambiguity there.) Or in the 1880s and ¡¯90s, when white Populists betrayed their Black Populist allies in a united struggle to redistribute railroad land grants to farmers, reduce debt by inflating currency, abolish private national banks, nationalize railroads and telegraphs, and impose a graduated income tax to shift the burden onto the wealthy, among other things. Many of these one-time white ¡°allies¡± joined the Ku Klux Klan, defeated the Lodge Force Bill of 1890 which would have authorized federal supervision of elections to protect black voting rights, and led the efforts to disfranchise black voters. Or the late 1960s, when vibrant struggles for black, brown, American Indian, Asian American, gay and lesbian, and women¡¯s liberation, the anti-war movement, and student demands for a democratic revolution were followed by white backlash and the election of Richard Nixon¡ªwhose rhetoric of ¡°law and order¡± and the ¡°silent majority¡± Trump shamelessly plagiarized. 
Of course, Hilary Clinton did win the popular vote, and some are resorting to the easy lament that, were it not for the arcane Electoral College (itself a relic of slave power), we would not be here. One might add, too, that had it not been for the gutting of the Voting Rights Act opening the door for expanded strategies of voter suppression, or the permanent disfranchisement of some or all convicted felons in ten states, or the fact that virtually all people currently in cages cannot vote at all, or the persistence of misogyny in our culture, we may have had a different outcome. This is all true. But we cannot ignore the fact that the vast majority of white men and a majority of white women, across class lines, voted for a platform and a message of white supremacy, Islamophobia, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia, anti-Semitism, anti-science, anti-Earth, militarism, torture, and policies that blatantly maintain income inequality. The vast majority of people of color voted against Trump, with black women registering the highest voting percentage for Clinton of any other demographic (93 percent). It is an astounding number when we consider that her husband¡¯s administration oversaw the virtual destruction of the social safety net by turning welfare into workfare, cutting food stamps, preventing undocumented workers from receiving benefits, and denying former drug felons and users access to public housing; a dramatic expansion of the border patrol, immigrant detention centers, and the fence on Mexico¡¯s border; a crime bill that escalated the war on drugs and accelerated mass incarceration; as well as NAFTA and legislation deregulating financial institutions. 
Still, had Trump received only a third of the votes he did and been defeated, we still would have had ample reason to worry about our future. 
¡°White privilege is taken for granted to the point where it need not be named and can¡¯t be named.¡± 
I am not suggesting that white racism alone explains Trump¡¯s victory. Nor am I dismissing the white working class¡¯s very real economic grievances. It is not a matter of disaffection versus racism or sexism versus fear. Rather, racism, class anxieties, and prevailing gender ideologies operate together, inseparably, or as Kimberl¨¦ Crenshaw would say, intersectionally. White working-class men understand their plight through a racial and gendered lens. For women and people of color to hold positions of privilege or power over them is simply unnatural and can only be explained by an act of unfairness¡ªfor example, affirmative action. White privilege is taken for granted to the point where it need not be named and can¡¯t be named. So, as activist/scholar Bill Fletcher recently observed, even though Trump¡¯s call to deport immigrants, close the borders, and reject free trade policies appealed to working-class whites¡¯ discontent with the effects of globalization, Trump¡¯s plans do not amount to a rejection of neoliberalism. Fletcher writes, ¡°Trump focused on the symptoms inherent in neoliberal globalization, such as job loss, but his was not a critique of neoliberalism. He continues to advance deregulation, tax cuts, anti-unionism, etc. He was making no systemic critique at all, but the examples that he pointed to from wreckage resulting from economic and social dislocation, resonated for many whites who felt, for various reasons, that their world was collapsing.¡± Yet Fletcher is quick not to reduce white working-class support for Trump to class fears alone, adding, ¡°This segment of the white population was looking in terror at the erosion of the American Dream, but they were looking at it through the prism of race.¡± 
A New York Times poll shows that Trump supporters identified immigration and terrorism, not the economy, as the two most important issues in the campaign. Immigration and terrorism are both about race¡ªMexicans and Muslims. That there are ¡°illegal¡± immigrants from around the globe, including Canada, Israel, and all over Europe doesn¡¯t matter: anti-immigrant movements target those who can be racially profiled. And while Trump¡¯s America fears ¡°terrorism,¡± it does not disavow homegrown terrorist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan, despite the fact that white nationalist movements are responsible for the majority of violent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. On the contrary, Trump was not only endorsed by white nationalists and U.S.-based fascists, but during the campaign he refused to renounce their support, and Trump¡¯s leading candidate for attorney general, Rudy Giuliani, has openly called Black Lives Matter ¡°terrorists.¡± 
So where do we go from here? If we really care about the world, our country, and our future, we have no choice but to resist. We need to reject a thoroughly bankrupt Democratic Party leadership that is calling for conciliation and, in Obama¡¯s words, ¡°rooting for [Trump¡¯s] success.¡± Pay attention: Trump¡¯s success means mass deportation; massive military spending; the continuation and escalation of global war; a conservative Supreme Court poised to roll back Roe v. Wade, marriage equality, and too many rights to name here; a justice department and FBI dedicated to growing the Bush/Obama-era surveillance state and waging COINTELPRO-style war on activists; fiscal policies that will accelerate income inequality; massive cuts in social spending; the weakening or elimination of the Affordable Care Act; and the partial dismantling and corporatization of government. 
What must resistance look like? There are at least five things we have to do right now: 
1. Build up the sanctuary movement. 
In the 1980s, when nearly one million refugees fled U.S.-backed dictatorships in Guatemala and El Salvador, churches offered shelter, sanctuary, and assistance to those seeking political asylum, and over thirty cities were subsequently designated ¡°sanctuary cities¡± by their local governments. The Obama administration¡¯s deportations of undocumented workers rebooted the sanctuary movement, along with a vibrant immigrant rights movement that pushed the president to use executive authority to launch the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). Trump has vowed to end both programs, leaving some five million immigrants vulnerable to deportation and identifiable through their applications, and he has promised to immediately cut all federal funding for sanctuary cities. To those who argue that millions of undocumented people are not ¡°political refugees,¡± I counter that Trump¡¯s war on immigrants is driven entirely by his quest to take power¡ªthey will become casualties of his political machinations. Some states have already outlawed the longstanding principle of sanctuary status, but this should not deter us from strengthening and expanding the sanctuary movement to other institutions. For example, many of us who work in the University of California system are working to turn our campuses into sanctuaries¡ªpreferably with legal and administrative backing. But even without the law behind us, we must act on moral principle. 
2. Defend all of our targeted communities. 
We must defend against hate crimes, Islamophobia, anti-black racism, attacks on queer and trans people, and the erosion of reproductive rights. There is no need to reinvent the wheel since there are already hundreds of organizations across the country dedicated to the fight, including INCITE: Women of Color Against Violence, Radical Women, the Immigrant Solidarity Network, the Praxis Project, the Praxis Center, CAAAV: Organizing Asian Communities, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), the African American Policy Forum, the Network Against Islamophobia, and Causa Justa, to name only a few. One of the main targets of attack, of course, is the Movement for Black Lives, along with the dozens of organizations upon which it was built¡ªBlack Lives Matter, the Dream Defenders, Million Hoodies, Black Youth Project 100, Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, We Charge Genocide, and Black Organizing for Leadership and Dignity (BOLD), among others. We need to support these movements and institutions, financially and by doing the work. And we must defend the political and cultural spaces that enable us to plot, plan, build community and sustain social movements. Here in Los Angeles this means spaces such as the L.A. Black Workers Center, the Labor/Community Strategy Center and its new community space, Strategy and Soul, the L.A. Community Action Network, the Southern California Library for Social Studies and Research, the Community Coalition, and Revolutionary Autonomous Communities, among many others. In New York we can point to Decolonize This Place; in Detroit, the Boggs Center; in St. Louis, Organization for Black Struggle, and so on. There are literally hundreds of centers around the country building for local power, and while none were immune to state surveillance in the past, we can expect heightened monitoring and outright attacks under this extreme right-wing regime. Now is not the time to retreat to our identity silos. We need solidarity more than ever, recognizing that all solidarities are imperfect, often fragile, temporary, and always forged in struggle and sustained through hard work. In our state of emergency, political disagreements, slights, misunderstandings, and microaggressions should not prohibit us from fighting for peoples rights, privileges, and lives. 
3. Stop referring to the South as a political backwater, a distinctive site of racist right-wing reaction. 
First, white supremacy, homophobia, and anti-union attitudes are national, not regional, problems. Second, black and multiracial groups in the South are at the forefront of resisting Trump¡¯s authoritarian agenda and building power outside the mainstream Democratic Party. Among them are Project South, Southerners on New Ground (SONG), the Moral Mondays Movement, Kindred: Southern Healing Justice Collective, Jackson Rising in Mississippi, Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) in Louisville, Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Atlanta, and the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights. 
The frontline battles that preceded Trump¡¯s election must not be abandoned. On the contrary, they need to be strengthened. We must redouble our fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline and support the Standing Rock Sioux Nation¡¯s historic resistance. There is no question that Trump¡¯s election has further empowered the corporation behind the pipeline¡ªthe Texas-based Fortune 500 company Energy Transfer Partners¡ªto continue to build no matter what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the Obama Justice Department says. We need to recognize Standing Rock as not only a struggle for environmental justice but an episode in Native people¡¯s five-hundred-year resistance to colonialism. And speaking of colonialism, the crisis in Puerto Rico has not abated¡ªnot in the least. As I write, Puerto Ricans on the island and in the U.S. mainland are using every means at their disposal to resist PROMESA, the U.S. plan that empowers a seven-member, unelected board to impose austerity measures as a way of restructuring its debt¡ªmeasures that include wage reductions, selling off public assets, altering retirement plans for public employees, and fast-tracking changes even if they violate existing laws. 
4. Support and deepen the anti-Klan and anti-fascist movement. 
We must especially support groups such as Southern Poverty Law Center, which has been on the frontlines of this movement for decades. Although the fight against white supremacist organizations has been continual since the 1860s, the federal government has never successfully outlawed the Klan and similar vigilante groups (although in the 1950s the state of Alabama succeeded in outlawing the NAACP). With Trump¡¯s election we are likely to see a surge in white nationalist and other right-wing terrorism, including attacks on black churches, synagogues, mosques, abortion clinics; and against non-white, queer, and trans people and immigrants. Some on the left will argue that resisting the so-called ¡°alt-right¡± is a secondary issue since these are fringe movements and building class unity across racial lines ought to be our priority. But with the memory of Colorado Springs and Charleston seared into our memory, this argument rings hollow. And while President Obama¡¯s poignant rendition of ¡°Amazing Grace¡± at Reverend Clementa Pinckney¡¯s funeral moved much of the nation, the truth is that it is easier to pass laws criminalizing organizations that support the boycott of businesses and institutions complicit in Israel¡¯s illegal occupation of Palestine than it is to outlaw the Ku Klux Klan. 
5. Rebuild the labor movement. 
As obvious as this may seem, the entire labor movement is under attack on a global scale. Today labor unions are portrayed as corrupt, bloated, a drain on the economy, and modern-day cartels that threaten workers¡¯ ¡°liberty.¡± Corporations and the CEOs who run them are portrayed as the most efficient and effective mode of organization. In our neoliberal age, emergency financial managers are sent in to replace elected government during real or imagined economic crises; charter schools organized along corporate lines are replacing public schools; universities are being restructured along corporate lines with presidents increasingly functioning like CEOs; and a businessman with a checkered record, a history of improprieties and legal violations and allegations of sexual assault, and no experience whatsoever in government is elected president. 
Today¡¯s economic debates focus not on alternatives to capitalism but on what kind of capitalism¡ªcapitalism with a safety net for the poor or one driven by extreme free-market liberalization? A capitalism in which the state¡¯s role is to bail out big banks and financial institutions, or one where the state imposes (or rather restores) greater regulation in order to avoid economic crises? In both of these scenarios, a weakened labor movement is a given. The once-powerful unions are doing little more than fighting to restore basic collective bargaining rights and deciding how much they are going to give back. Union leaders are struggling just to participate in crafting austerity measures. In the New Deal era, the state¡¯s efforts to save capitalism centered on Keynesian strategies of massive state expenditures in infrastructure, job creation, a social safety net in the form of direct aid and social security, and certain protections for the right of unions to organize. All these measures were made possible by a strong labor movement. There was a level of militant organization that we did not see in our post-2008 collapse, in spite of Occupy Wall Street. While Occupy was massive, international, and built on preexisting social justice movements, it lacked the kind of institutional power base and political clout that organized labor had in the 1930s. Of course, labor unions have also been powerful engines of racial and gender exclusion, working with capital to impose glass ceilings and racially segmented wages, but the twenty-first-century labor movement has largely embraced principles of social justice, antiracism, immigrant rights, and cross-border strategies. 
¡°I am talking about opening a path to freeing white people from the prison house of whiteness.¡± 
Obviously there is much missing here, like abolishing the Electoral College and continuing to wage a fight for local power in the legislative and electoral arenas as well as in the streets. Local campaigns to raise the minimum wage, for example, have not only produced key victories but served to mobilize people around issues of injustice and inequality. The sites of resistance will become clearer as the political situation becomes more concrete, especially after January 20. 
But I want to return to the white working class and how we might break the cycle of ¡°whitelash.¡± First, we cannot change this country without winning over some portion of white working people, and I am not talking about gaining votes for the Democratic Party. I am talking about opening a path to freeing white people from the prison house of whiteness. True, with whiteness comes privilege, but many of the perceived privileges are inaccessible to most, which then generates resentment. Exposing whiteness for what it is¡ªa foundational myth for the birth and consolidation of capitalism¡ªis fundamental if we are to build a genuine social movement dedicated to dismantling the oppressive regimes of racism, heteropatriarchy, empire, and class exploitation that is at the root of inequality, precarity, materialism, and violence in many forms. I am not suggesting we ignore their grievances, but that we help white working people understand the source of their discontent¡ªreal and imagined. 
Is this possible? The struggle to recruit the white working class is an old story. Black movement leaders have been trying to free white working people from the paltry wages of whiteness since Reconstruction, at least, and it seems to always end badly. This history is not necessarily legible because we tend to conflate populism and fascism with what Henry Giroux astutely identifies as authoritarianism. Populism is the idea that ordinary people ought to have the power to control their government and their communities, especially along lines that benefit the collective. In the 1880s and ¡¯90s, the black populist movement adopted a vision of a new society based on cooperative economics. The great writer and activist Timothy Thomas Fortune gave their unique vision eloquent voice and plans for action in his book Black and White: Land, Labor and Politics in the South (1884), which offered a path for the emancipation of the nation as a whole, not just black people. He attacked America¡¯s betrayal of Reconstruction, identified monopoly and private ownership of land as the central source of inequality, and articulated a vision of a democratic, caring political economy based on equity and fairness. The National Colored Alliance members had advanced beyond printing more money or demanding free silver, adopting instead a more radical redistribution of wealth and power. They wanted more than a short-term alliance just to raise wages for picking cotton or reducing debt. But Fortune understood that a genuine cooperative commonwealth is not possible unless white workers and farmers join the movement. ¡°The hour is approaching,¡± he wrote, ¡°when the laboring classes of our country, North, East, West and South, will recognize that they have a common cause, a common humanity and a common enemy; and that, therefore, if they would triumph over wrong and place the laurel wreath upon triumphant justice, without distinction of race or of previous condition they must unite!¡± Whatever unity they managed to create proved ephemeral. As in so many other scenarios, most whites chose white supremacy over liberation. 
The lessons here are crucial. We cannot build a sustainable movement without a paradigm shift. Stopgap, utilitarian alliances to stop Trump aren¡¯t enough. I concur with Giroux, who calls on all of us to wage ¡°an anti-fascist struggle that is not simply about remaking economic structures, but also about refashioning identities, values, and social relations as part of a democratic project that reconfigures what it means to desire a better and more democratic future.¡± Robin Davis Gibran Kelley is the Gary B.

Donald Trump is mostly bad news for Africa, including reduced U.S. aid and possibly more support for ¡°imperial African adventurism"" ¨C unless, of course, Africa uses Trump¡¯s lemons to make lemonade. His isolationism ¡°could give Africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops.¡± On climate policy, Trump is an unmitigated disaster. What Does a Trump Victory Mean for Africa? by Patrick Bond 
This article previously appeared in Pambazuka News . 
¡° Trump will sabotage the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and similar strategies to solve global problems.¡± 
The most catastrophic long-term consequence is climate change. This is because Trump is a denialist who will give the green light to widespread fracking, coal and oil exploration. Africa will be the most adversely affected continent. United Nations scientists estimate that 9 out of 10 small-scale farmers are unlikely to farm by 2100 due to drying soils and global warming, plus extreme weather will also cause 180 million unnecessary African deaths by then, according to Christian Aid. 
Under Trump, we can safely predict that Washington will no longer seek to control United Nations climate negotiations, as did Barack Obama¡¯s administration. The WikiLeaks Clinton emails and State Department cables revealed blatant manipulations of the Copenhagen and Durban climate summits. Instead, Trump will simply pull the US out of the 2015 Paris agreement, as did George W. Bush from the Kyoto Protocol. 
By good fortune, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change annual summit is underway this week in Morocco. The only logical move, if the delegates have any spine, is to expel the US State Department and establish the machinery for a major carbon tax applied to products associated with countries ¨C the US especially ¨C which raise emissions and threaten the survival of many species across the globe. 
¡°Trump will simply pull the US out of the 2015 Paris agreement, as did George W. Bush from the Kyoto Protocol.¡± 
Trump also heralds a rise in US racism and xenophobia, parallel to the Brexit vote by the British white working class. In neither case will local solutions be effective for the simple reason that neither Trump nor Theresa May (UK Prime Minister) are interested in the income redistribution required to benefit their economies. 
And African elites who have ¨C with a few exceptions ¨C climbed over each other to please Washington, won¡¯t find themselves welcome in the White House. 
Hopefully the contagion of Trump¡¯s racism ¨C which will make life for Africans much harder ¨C will be met by a major resistance movement including Africans from all walks of life in solidarity with various groups that stand to be oppressed by the US ¨C women, African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims, environmentalists, progressives of all sorts. This movement can shape up in the same spirit to those that gave solidarity during the fight against apartheid. 
What are the likely economic consequences? 
Consistent with his isolationism, world trade stagnation will continue. In the case of Africa, Trump is likely to retract benefits under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act and reduce US aid. 
That isolationism, in turn, could give Africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops. Africa must focus on localizing its economies to be able to meet basic needs. 
Trump¡¯s hatred of what he terms the ¡°globalists¡± is probably just hot electioneering rhetoric. It¡¯s fair to predict that pro-corporate candidates will come forward as Trump allies to calm the crashing stock markets. 
The ¡°neoliberal¡± group of policy wonks who expressed disgust with Trump and favored Hillary Clinton will quickly make inroads into the new administration. They will ensure that the continuing US dominance in Western-leaning multilateral institutions is not disturbed. 
We can simply anticipate more brazen US self-interest, as witnessed during the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush regimes, with less of the confusing rhetoric promoted by Obama and his allies. 
What US policies on Africa are likely to change? With what impact? 
To be frank, we can only offer guesses. Trump said literally nothing about Africa during his campaign. He wants to ¡°rebuild US military power,¡± which might include strengthening the Pentagon¡¯s controversial Africa Command, known as Africom. 
Economically, it is worth noting Trump¡¯s close relations to the oil and gas industry which comes via Vice President Mike Pence. This suggests that multinational corporations in the extractive industries who desire more explicit imperial support for African adventurism will be served well by Trump¡¯s bully-boy mentality. 
What does this mean for multilateral institutions and how will this affect Africa? 
The US¡¯s role in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will become nastier given the veto power it enjoys, holding more than 15% of the voting shares. Trump will probably hire a brutal neoliberal as his IMF executive director, someone who will tighten the screws on Africa using Washington¡¯s veto power. The leaders of two big African economies are desperate for IMF credits: Nigeria ($29 billion) and Egypt ($12 billion). 
In relation to the United Nations, an interesting question comes to mind: should the UN leadership now sitting in Trump¡¯s Manhattan East Side neighborhood not develop a contingency plan to move UN headquarters out of the US? Trump promises to make life very hard for visitors who are Muslims, Libyans, Syrians and Mexicans ¨C amongst others ¨C so holding multilateral events in the US may soon be impossible. 
The period ahead demands a very different multilateralism due to a number of expectations. The first is that Trump will sabotage the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and similar strategies to solve global problems, and wreck nuclear non-proliferation strategies such as the agreement that Obama painstakingly reached with Iran earlier this year. 
And the second is that three of the BRICS¡¯ nationalistic leaders ¨C Vladimir Putin in Russia, Nahendra Modi in India and Michel Temer in Brazil ¨C can be expected to establish much closer ties to Trump. This is likely to affect the balance of power between geographical regions, added to which are the drift of Pakistan, Turkey and the Philippines away from Washington. Trump¡¯s hatred of China is another indeterminate factor. 
Regardless of the geopolitical maneuvers, it¡¯s time for a ¡®multilateralism-from-below¡¯ in which traditional progressive movements in civil society find common cause, because this is the most serious threat to humanity, the world economy and environment we¡¯ve seen in living memory.

Donald Trump¡¯s many evils are manifest and obvious. But let¡¯s stop pretending that some historical line has been crossed in U.S. political and social relations. ¡°The dictates of white supremacy are ever present and the numbers of white people who do anything serious about it are small.¡± Newly outraged Democrats act like they¡¯ve never seen a fascist. ¡°There is an ample supply of domestic fascists. They are the people who wear police uniforms.¡± Freedom Rider : How Not to Protest Trump by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
¡° There are many unique characteristics to the Donald Trump story but the institutional evils that permeate this country persist no matter who sits in the oval office. ¡± 
Thousands of progressives are taking to the streets in opposition to the Donald Trump presidency. After eight years of Obama induced slumber they awoke with quite a start. Many of these individuals and organizations protested as part of the anti-war, Occupy and Black Lives Matter movements, but others weren¡¯t concerned about very much until the reality show host became president elect. 
The awful Hillary Clinton should be inaugurated the 45 th president of the United States because she won the popular vote. But for the second time in less than twenty years a Democrat preferred by the people will instead be an historical footnote. If nothing else the Electoral College is rightly condemned. 
But where else should protesters direct their anger? If they are concerned about fascism they could protest police killings, or United States government murders committed during numerous interventions abroad. They might have risen up against the mass incarceration state. The list of outrages that should get people moving is quite long. 
White liberals here in New York City didn¡¯t care very much when black and brown residents were subjected to nearly one million police encounters. Mayor Bloomberg¡¯s infamous stop and frisk program was a tailor made opportunity for public anger. Yet every poll indicated that white people were in favor of this very fascist 21 st century slave patrol. Those same people are now upset but what exactly has raised their ire? 
¡°Trump is no more hostile to the rights of the press than Obama was.¡± 
They say they are concerned about the rights of undocumented people but they didn¡¯t say much when Obama acted as the Deporter-in-Chief. The so-called Muslim registry of men from 25 countries under the auspices of the NSEERS program lasted from 2002 to 2011. That is to say during two years of the Obama administration. They may be concerned about climate change and Trump¡¯s promise to end America¡¯s participation in the most recent climate agreement. But that agreement allows for a rise in carbon production and thus in world temperatures. They would have been smarter to challenge the phony climate change process itself. 
They say they are afraid that Trump will muzzle the press. His shouting match with network executives should not be a cause for alarm. Eventually they¡¯ll start saying good things about him so he was foolish to be so hostile. But he is no more hostile to the rights of the press than Obama was. When he used the Espionage Act to punish leakers and whistle blowers many of the now distraught progressives didn¡¯t say much. 
So what has gotten progressives so angry? There is nothing new about the so-called alt-right movement. There is always a way to brand white nationalism. They may be the Tea Party one day and alt-right the next but it all amounts to the same thing. The dictates of white supremacy are ever present and the numbers of white people who do anything serious about it are small. 
If the sight of naziesque salutes to Trump are upsetting just keep in mind that there is an ample supply of domestic fascists. They are the people who wear police uniforms. They may not ¡°hail Trump¡± or anyone else but they kill three people in this country every day. 
¡° Barack Obama and Eric Holder quite literally kept thousands of black people in jail who could have been freed.¡± 
Donald Trump should be given credit for providing so much low hanging fruit. His appointment of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions to the post of attorney general provides ready made ingredients for fear and anger. Sessions was once denied a federal judgeship in part because of racist remarks directed at a black attorney. And who can ignore the glorification of the Confederacy in his name. But what did Obama and his two black attorney generals do? There were no prosecutions of killer police. That fact is a curious one in the age of murder caught on video. The Obama Justice Department argued against giving the right to request resentencing for those convicted during the years of draconian drug crime prosecution. Barack Obama and Eric Holder quite literally kept thousands of black people in jail who could have been freed. 
It is difficult to take protesters seriously when they won¡¯t even direct their anger at the party which displayed such gross incompetence during the recent campaign. The inability to defeat the man who seemed so unsuited to the presidency should stir anger towards the people whose hubris brought him to the White House. 
There is always a need to engage in struggle, whether a Republican or Democrat is president. There are many unique characteristics to the Donald Trump story but the institutional evils that permeate this country persist no matter who sits in the oval office. We can gauge the true level of concern about justice when a Democrat next emerges victorious. A president who provides a greater opportunity for scorn should not be the last one who faces opposition.

Fears of Trump should not obscure the fact that Barack Obama¡¯s reign was a disaster. ¡°Black America is in a worse condition than before, working class people as a whole have lost ground to a low-wage economy, and the world is closer to a World War III scenario than at any point prior.¡± The struggle continues, but ¡°it is important to ensure that the protests against Trump are not allowed to be channeled back into the Democratic Party graveyard.¡± Obama's Departure is One Reason to Feel Optimism for Trump's Arrival by Danny Haiphong 
¡°Only gridlock saved Social Security and Medicare from being privatized during his Presidency.¡± 
Thousands have taken to the streets across the country to protest Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 elections. The protests have mainly centered on Trump's racism, sexism, and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric spewed during his campaign. Protesters have yet to wrestle with Trump's positions on foreign policy and trade that made him a pariah to the majority of the ruling class. The struggle against capitalism and imperialism in the US remains immature even in the midst of positive growth in the movement against police brutality and racism in recent years. While Trump's overt bigotry gives cause for protest, there is one benefit of the Trump moment that should not be understated. That benefit is the much needed conclusion of the Obama era. 
Democrats across the US are in a state of mourning over the departure of Obama. Democrats heralded Obama as the quintessential professional and consummate politician. His celebrity was peppered by the appearance of intelligence and rationality in the face of so-called Republican ""obstructionism."" Obama's rule was advertised as a victory for the Black Freedom movement. His Administration possessed a vast marketing apparatus that defended him as the lesser-evil alternative to the racist vitriol of the White Man's Republican Party. 
¡°Obama's rule was advertised as a victory for the Black Freedom movement.¡± 
Black Agenda Report was one of the few on the left that warned of the dangers of Obama in 2008. Once elected, Obama became virtually untouchable. Criticisms of his policies were condemned as racist and insensitive to the needs of Black America. The needs of Black America and the entire left for that matter suddenly became aligned with whatever Obama did. Obama moved forward to protect the banks, escalate war, and erect the largest national security state ever assembled. He instantly became the austerity President, waging a war of privatization on public education with the expressed plans to do the same to Social Security. Only gridlock saved Social Security and Medicare from being privatized during his Presidency. 
The full scope of Obama's legacy has been discussed in earlier issues and will not be analyzed here. What is important is that the left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism. No longer will the left be able to fall back on the first Black President to sanitize his record. Obama's immigration policies deported nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants with little protest. His Administration painted itself as a friend of women and LGBTQ identified people despite the fact that his policy of proxy and drone warfare murdered tens of thousands of women and children in Yemen, Syria, Libya, and Honduras. 
¡°The left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism.¡± 
Obama was able to conduct a greater assault on oppressed people than the prior Bush Administration, making him the most effective evil Wall Street could buy. Obama took over as President in a period where the US was mired in two unpopular occupations abroad and an economic crisis at home. These conditions prompted the ruling class to choose Obama as the required form of counterinsurgency necessary to crush resistance before it started. After making a number of promises to end ""dumb wars"" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class. Eight years later, Black America is in a worse condition than before, working class people as a whole have lost ground to a low-wage economy , and the world is closer to a World War III scenario than at any point prior. 
The massive protests to Trump's victory are in part a release of popular energy brought on by the departure of Obama. Unrest began with the formation of the Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter movements. However, neither of these movements articulated Obama's role in creating the conditions for social insurgency and movement. The 2016 elections changed the landscape dramatically. The Sanders and Trump campaigns set millions into motion in protest of the two-party establishment. Obama's departure will be another breath of fresh air into the internal rot of the imperialist system. It is thus important to ensure that the protests against Trump are not allowed to be channeled back into the Democratic Party graveyard. 
¡°After making a number of promises to end ""dumb wars"" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class.¡± 
Obama will leave Trump a set of conditions that he cannot possibly maintain without popular unrest. Obama departs office only inches from World War III with Russia and China. Poverty and wealth inequality worsened under his administration . Not even clever distortions of statistics could hide the large number of workers currently unemployed or underemployed in the low-wage economy. School closures, food stamp cuts, and bank bailouts have unleashed the neo-liberal wasteland that Trump spoke about in his campaign. 
It appears early on that the left has rejected the viability of Trump's calls to regulate the banks and renegotiate trade deals in favor of working people. Many have ignored Trump¡¯s ¡°populist¡± rhetoric and have focused all the energy of resistance on his white supremacist proposals to ban Muslims and deport millions of undocumented people. However, this moment is just as much about Obama's departure as it is Trump's arrival. The US imperialist system is facing multiple crises that relate directly back to the economic stagnation of global capitalism. It would be a mistake not to demand Trump stay true to his ¡°populism¡± just as it was a mistake when the left failed to demand Obama stay true to his promises. Whatever the case, the departure of Obama is a welcome site, and the left should use the room afforded by it to wage an intensified effort to build the organizational basis for social revolution in our time.

Kelley 
This article previously appeared in Boston Review . 
¡°We need to reject a thoroughly bankrupt Democratic Party leadership that is calling for conciliation and, in Obama¡¯s words, ¡°rooting for [Trump¡¯s] success.¡± 
¡°If we are to keep the enormity of the forces aligned against us from establishing a false hierarchy of oppression, we must school ourselves to recognize that any attack against Blacks, any attack against women, is an attack against all of us who recognize that our interests are not being served by the systems we support. Each one of us here is a link in the connection between antipoor legislation, gay shootings, the burning of synagogues, street harassment, attacks against women, and resurgent violence against Black people.¡± ¡ª Audre Lorde, ¡°Learning from the 60s¡± 
Donald J. Trump¡¯s election was a national trauma, an epic catastrophe that has left millions in the United States and around the world in a state of utter shock, uncertainty, deep depression, and genuine fear. The fear is palpable and justified, especially for those Trump and his acolytes targeted¡ªthe undocumented, Muslims, anyone who ¡°looks¡± undocumented or Muslim, people of color, Jews, the LGBTQ community, the disabled, women, activists of all kinds (especially Black Lives Matter and allied movements resisting state-sanctioned violence), trade unions. . . . the list is long. And the attacks have begun; as I write these words, reports of hate crimes and racist violence are flooding my inbox. 
The common refrain is that no one expected this. (Of course, the truth is that many people did expect this, just not in the elite media.) At no point, this refrain goes, could ¡°we¡± imagine Trump in the Oval office surrounded by a cabinet made up of some of the most idiotic, corrupt, and authoritarian characters in modern day politics¡ªRudolph Giuliani, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, John Bolton, Ben Carson, Jeff Sessions, David ¡°Blue Lives Matter¡± Clarke, Joe Arpaio, to name a few. Meanwhile, paid professional pundits are scrambling to peddle their analyses and to normalize the results¡ªon the same broadcast media that helped deliver Trump¡¯s victory by making him their ratings-boosting spectacle rather than attending to issues, ideas, and other candidates (e.g., Bernie Sanders or Jill Stein). They deliver the same old platitudes: disaffected voters, angry white men who have suffered economically and feel forgotten, Trump¡¯s populist message represented the nation¡¯s deep-seated distrust of Washington, ad infinitum. Some liberal pundits have begun to speak of President-Elect Trump as thoughtful and conciliatory, and some even suggest that his unpredictability may prove to be an asset. The protests are premature or misplaced. All of this from the same folks who predicted a Clinton victory. 
¡°Trump¡¯s followers are attracted to his wealth as metonym of an American dream that they, too, can enjoy once America is ¡®great¡¯ again.¡± 
But the outcome should not have surprised us. This election was, among other things, a referendum on whether the United States will be a straight, white nation reminiscent of the mythic ¡°old days¡± when armed white men ruled, owned their castle, boasted of unvanquished military power, and everyone else knew their place. Henry Giroux¡¯s new book America at War With Itself made this point with clarity and foresight two months before the election. The easy claim that Trump appeals to legitimate working-class populism driven by class anger, Giroux argues, ignores both the historical link between whiteness, citizenship, and humanity, and the American dream of wealth accumulation built on private property. Trump¡¯s followers are not trying to redistribute the wealth, nor are they all ¡°working class¡±¡ªtheir annual median income is about $72,000. On the contrary, they are attracted to Trump¡¯s wealth as metonym of an American dream that they, too, can enjoy once America is ¡°great¡± again¡ªwhich is to say, once the country returns to being ¡°a white MAN¡¯s country.¡± What Giroux identifies as ¡°civic illiteracy¡± keeps them convinced that the descendants of unfree labor or the colonized, or those who are currently unfree, are to blame for America¡¯s decline and for blocking their path to Trump-style success. 
For the white people who voted overwhelmingly for Trump, their candidate embodied the anti-Obama backlash. Pundits who say race was not a factor point to rural, predominantly white counties that went for Obama in 2008 and 2012, but now went for Trump, and to the low black and Latinx voter turnout. However, turnout was down overall, not just among African Americans. Post-election analysis shows that as a percentage of total votes the black vote dropped only 1 percent compared with the 2012 election, even while the number of black ballots counted decreased by nearly 11 percent. (Why this happened is beyond the scope of this essay, but one might begin with Greg Palast¡¯s findings about voter suppression and the use of ¡°crosscheck¡± to invalidate ballots.) Moreover, claims that nearly a third of Latinxs went for Trump have been disputed by the website Latino Decision, whose careful research puts the figure at 18 percent. The turnout does not contradict the fact that Trump drew the clear majority of white votes. This is not startling news. 
¡°We cannot ignore the fact that the vast majority of white men and a majority of white women, across class lines, voted for a platform and a message of white supremacy.¡± 
If history is our guide, ¡°whitelash¡± usually follows periods of expanded racial justice and democratic rights. In the aftermath of Reconstruction, there were many instances in which southern white men switched from the biracial, abolitionist Republicans to the ¡°redeemers,¡± whether it be the Democrats or, in states like Texas, the ¡°White Man¡¯s Party.¡± (No ambiguity there.) Or in the 1880s and ¡¯90s, when white Populists betrayed their Black Populist allies in a united struggle to redistribute railroad land grants to farmers, reduce debt by inflating currency, abolish private national banks, nationalize railroads and telegraphs, and impose a graduated income tax to shift the burden onto the wealthy, among other things. Many of these one-time white ¡°allies¡± joined the Ku Klux Klan, defeated the Lodge Force Bill of 1890 which would have authorized federal supervision of elections to protect black voting rights, and led the efforts to disfranchise black voters. Or the late 1960s, when vibrant struggles for black, brown, American Indian, Asian American, gay and lesbian, and women¡¯s liberation, the anti-war movement, and student demands for a democratic revolution were followed by white backlash and the election of Richard Nixon¡ªwhose rhetoric of ¡°law and order¡± and the ¡°silent majority¡± Trump shamelessly plagiarized. 
Of course, Hilary Clinton did win the popular vote, and some are resorting to the easy lament that, were it not for the arcane Electoral College (itself a relic of slave power), we would not be here. One might add, too, that had it not been for the gutting of the Voting Rights Act opening the door for expanded strategies of voter suppression, or the permanent disfranchisement of some or all convicted felons in ten states, or the fact that virtually all people currently in cages cannot vote at all, or the persistence of misogyny in our culture, we may have had a different outcome. This is all true. But we cannot ignore the fact that the vast majority of white men and a majority of white women, across class lines, voted for a platform and a message of white supremacy, Islamophobia, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia, anti-Semitism, anti-science, anti-Earth, militarism, torture, and policies that blatantly maintain income inequality. The vast majority of people of color voted against Trump, with black women registering the highest voting percentage for Clinton of any other demographic (93 percent). It is an astounding number when we consider that her husband¡¯s administration oversaw the virtual destruction of the social safety net by turning welfare into workfare, cutting food stamps, preventing undocumented workers from receiving benefits, and denying former drug felons and users access to public housing; a dramatic expansion of the border patrol, immigrant detention centers, and the fence on Mexico¡¯s border; a crime bill that escalated the war on drugs and accelerated mass incarceration; as well as NAFTA and legislation deregulating financial institutions. 
Still, had Trump received only a third of the votes he did and been defeated, we still would have had ample reason to worry about our future. 
¡°White privilege is taken for granted to the point where it need not be named and can¡¯t be named.¡± 
I am not suggesting that white racism alone explains Trump¡¯s victory. Nor am I dismissing the white working class¡¯s very real economic grievances. It is not a matter of disaffection versus racism or sexism versus fear. Rather, racism, class anxieties, and prevailing gender ideologies operate together, inseparably, or as Kimberl¨¦ Crenshaw would say, intersectionally. White working-class men understand their plight through a racial and gendered lens. For women and people of color to hold positions of privilege or power over them is simply unnatural and can only be explained by an act of unfairness¡ªfor example, affirmative action. White privilege is taken for granted to the point where it need not be named and can¡¯t be named. So, as activist/scholar Bill Fletcher recently observed, even though Trump¡¯s call to deport immigrants, close the borders, and reject free trade policies appealed to working-class whites¡¯ discontent with the effects of globalization, Trump¡¯s plans do not amount to a rejection of neoliberalism. Fletcher writes, ¡°Trump focused on the symptoms inherent in neoliberal globalization, such as job loss, but his was not a critique of neoliberalism. He continues to advance deregulation, tax cuts, anti-unionism, etc. He was making no systemic critique at all, but the examples that he pointed to from wreckage resulting from economic and social dislocation, resonated for many whites who felt, for various reasons, that their world was collapsing.¡± Yet Fletcher is quick not to reduce white working-class support for Trump to class fears alone, adding, ¡°This segment of the white population was looking in terror at the erosion of the American Dream, but they were looking at it through the prism of race.¡± 
A New York Times poll shows that Trump supporters identified immigration and terrorism, not the economy, as the two most important issues in the campaign. Immigration and terrorism are both about race¡ªMexicans and Muslims. That there are ¡°illegal¡± immigrants from around the globe, including Canada, Israel, and all over Europe doesn¡¯t matter: anti-immigrant movements target those who can be racially profiled. And while Trump¡¯s America fears ¡°terrorism,¡± it does not disavow homegrown terrorist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan, despite the fact that white nationalist movements are responsible for the majority of violent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. On the contrary, Trump was not only endorsed by white nationalists and U.S.-based fascists, but during the campaign he refused to renounce their support, and Trump¡¯s leading candidate for attorney general, Rudy Giuliani, has openly called Black Lives Matter ¡°terrorists.¡± 
So where do we go from here? If we really care about the world, our country, and our future, we have no choice but to resist. We need to reject a thoroughly bankrupt Democratic Party leadership that is calling for conciliation and, in Obama¡¯s words, ¡°rooting for [Trump¡¯s] success.¡± Pay attention: Trump¡¯s success means mass deportation; massive military spending; the continuation and escalation of global war; a conservative Supreme Court poised to roll back Roe v. Wade, marriage equality, and too many rights to name here; a justice department and FBI dedicated to growing the Bush/Obama-era surveillance state and waging COINTELPRO-style war on activists; fiscal policies that will accelerate income inequality; massive cuts in social spending; the weakening or elimination of the Affordable Care Act; and the partial dismantling and corporatization of government. 
What must resistance look like? There are at least five things we have to do right now: 
1. Build up the sanctuary movement. 
In the 1980s, when nearly one million refugees fled U.S.-backed dictatorships in Guatemala and El Salvador, churches offered shelter, sanctuary, and assistance to those seeking political asylum, and over thirty cities were subsequently designated ¡°sanctuary cities¡± by their local governments. The Obama administration¡¯s deportations of undocumented workers rebooted the sanctuary movement, along with a vibrant immigrant rights movement that pushed the president to use executive authority to launch the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). Trump has vowed to end both programs, leaving some five million immigrants vulnerable to deportation and identifiable through their applications, and he has promised to immediately cut all federal funding for sanctuary cities. To those who argue that millions of undocumented people are not ¡°political refugees,¡± I counter that Trump¡¯s war on immigrants is driven entirely by his quest to take power¡ªthey will become casualties of his political machinations. Some states have already outlawed the longstanding principle of sanctuary status, but this should not deter us from strengthening and expanding the sanctuary movement to other institutions. For example, many of us who work in the University of California system are working to turn our campuses into sanctuaries¡ªpreferably with legal and administrative backing. But even without the law behind us, we must act on moral principle. 
2. Defend all of our targeted communities. 
We must defend against hate crimes, Islamophobia, anti-black racism, attacks on queer and trans people, and the erosion of reproductive rights. There is no need to reinvent the wheel since there are already hundreds of organizations across the country dedicated to the fight, including INCITE: Women of Color Against Violence, Radical Women, the Immigrant Solidarity Network, the Praxis Project, the Praxis Center, CAAAV: Organizing Asian Communities, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), the African American Policy Forum, the Network Against Islamophobia, and Causa Justa, to name only a few. One of the main targets of attack, of course, is the Movement for Black Lives, along with the dozens of organizations upon which it was built¡ªBlack Lives Matter, the Dream Defenders, Million Hoodies, Black Youth Project 100, Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, We Charge Genocide, and Black Organizing for Leadership and Dignity (BOLD), among others. We need to support these movements and institutions, financially and by doing the work. And we must defend the political and cultural spaces that enable us to plot, plan, build community and sustain social movements. Here in Los Angeles this means spaces such as the L.A. Black Workers Center, the Labor/Community Strategy Center and its new community space, Strategy and Soul, the L.A. Community Action Network, the Southern California Library for Social Studies and Research, the Community Coalition, and Revolutionary Autonomous Communities, among many others. In New York we can point to Decolonize This Place; in Detroit, the Boggs Center; in St. Louis, Organization for Black Struggle, and so on. There are literally hundreds of centers around the country building for local power, and while none were immune to state surveillance in the past, we can expect heightened monitoring and outright attacks under this extreme right-wing regime. Now is not the time to retreat to our identity silos. We need solidarity more than ever, recognizing that all solidarities are imperfect, often fragile, temporary, and always forged in struggle and sustained through hard work. In our state of emergency, political disagreements, slights, misunderstandings, and microaggressions should not prohibit us from fighting for peoples rights, privileges, and lives. 
3. Stop referring to the South as a political backwater, a distinctive site of racist right-wing reaction. 
First, white supremacy, homophobia, and anti-union attitudes are national, not regional, problems. Second, black and multiracial groups in the South are at the forefront of resisting Trump¡¯s authoritarian agenda and building power outside the mainstream Democratic Party. Among them are Project South, Southerners on New Ground (SONG), the Moral Mondays Movement, Kindred: Southern Healing Justice Collective, Jackson Rising in Mississippi, Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) in Louisville, Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Atlanta, and the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights. 
The frontline battles that preceded Trump¡¯s election must not be abandoned. On the contrary, they need to be strengthened. We must redouble our fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline and support the Standing Rock Sioux Nation¡¯s historic resistance. There is no question that Trump¡¯s election has further empowered the corporation behind the pipeline¡ªthe Texas-based Fortune 500 company Energy Transfer Partners¡ªto continue to build no matter what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the Obama Justice Department says. We need to recognize Standing Rock as not only a struggle for environmental justice but an episode in Native people¡¯s five-hundred-year resistance to colonialism. And speaking of colonialism, the crisis in Puerto Rico has not abated¡ªnot in the least. As I write, Puerto Ricans on the island and in the U.S. mainland are using every means at their disposal to resist PROMESA, the U.S. plan that empowers a seven-member, unelected board to impose austerity measures as a way of restructuring its debt¡ªmeasures that include wage reductions, selling off public assets, altering retirement plans for public employees, and fast-tracking changes even if they violate existing laws. 
4. Support and deepen the anti-Klan and anti-fascist movement. 
We must especially support groups such as Southern Poverty Law Center, which has been on the frontlines of this movement for decades. Although the fight against white supremacist organizations has been continual since the 1860s, the federal government has never successfully outlawed the Klan and similar vigilante groups (although in the 1950s the state of Alabama succeeded in outlawing the NAACP). With Trump¡¯s election we are likely to see a surge in white nationalist and other right-wing terrorism, including attacks on black churches, synagogues, mosques, abortion clinics; and against non-white, queer, and trans people and immigrants. Some on the left will argue that resisting the so-called ¡°alt-right¡± is a secondary issue since these are fringe movements and building class unity across racial lines ought to be our priority. But with the memory of Colorado Springs and Charleston seared into our memory, this argument rings hollow. And while President Obama¡¯s poignant rendition of ¡°Amazing Grace¡± at Reverend Clementa Pinckney¡¯s funeral moved much of the nation, the truth is that it is easier to pass laws criminalizing organizations that support the boycott of businesses and institutions complicit in Israel¡¯s illegal occupation of Palestine than it is to outlaw the Ku Klux Klan. 
5. Rebuild the labor movement. 
As obvious as this may seem, the entire labor movement is under attack on a global scale. Today labor unions are portrayed as corrupt, bloated, a drain on the economy, and modern-day cartels that threaten workers¡¯ ¡°liberty.¡± Corporations and the CEOs who run them are portrayed as the most efficient and effective mode of organization. In our neoliberal age, emergency financial managers are sent in to replace elected government during real or imagined economic crises; charter schools organized along corporate lines are replacing public schools; universities are being restructured along corporate lines with presidents increasingly functioning like CEOs; and a businessman with a checkered record, a history of improprieties and legal violations and allegations of sexual assault, and no experience whatsoever in government is elected president. 
Today¡¯s economic debates focus not on alternatives to capitalism but on what kind of capitalism¡ªcapitalism with a safety net for the poor or one driven by extreme free-market liberalization? A capitalism in which the state¡¯s role is to bail out big banks and financial institutions, or one where the state imposes (or rather restores) greater regulation in order to avoid economic crises? In both of these scenarios, a weakened labor movement is a given. The once-powerful unions are doing little more than fighting to restore basic collective bargaining rights and deciding how much they are going to give back. Union leaders are struggling just to participate in crafting austerity measures. In the New Deal era, the state¡¯s efforts to save capitalism centered on Keynesian strategies of massive state expenditures in infrastructure, job creation, a social safety net in the form of direct aid and social security, and certain protections for the right of unions to organize. All these measures were made possible by a strong labor movement. There was a level of militant organization that we did not see in our post-2008 collapse, in spite of Occupy Wall Street. While Occupy was massive, international, and built on preexisting social justice movements, it lacked the kind of institutional power base and political clout that organized labor had in the 1930s. Of course, labor unions have also been powerful engines of racial and gender exclusion, working with capital to impose glass ceilings and racially segmented wages, but the twenty-first-century labor movement has largely embraced principles of social justice, antiracism, immigrant rights, and cross-border strategies. 
¡°I am talking about opening a path to freeing white people from the prison house of whiteness.¡± 
Obviously there is much missing here, like abolishing the Electoral College and continuing to wage a fight for local power in the legislative and electoral arenas as well as in the streets. Local campaigns to raise the minimum wage, for example, have not only produced key victories but served to mobilize people around issues of injustice and inequality. The sites of resistance will become clearer as the political situation becomes more concrete, especially after January 20. 
But I want to return to the white working class and how we might break the cycle of ¡°whitelash.¡± First, we cannot change this country without winning over some portion of white working people, and I am not talking about gaining votes for the Democratic Party. I am talking about opening a path to freeing white people from the prison house of whiteness. True, with whiteness comes privilege, but many of the perceived privileges are inaccessible to most, which then generates resentment. Exposing whiteness for what it is¡ªa foundational myth for the birth and consolidation of capitalism¡ªis fundamental if we are to build a genuine social movement dedicated to dismantling the oppressive regimes of racism, heteropatriarchy, empire, and class exploitation that is at the root of inequality, precarity, materialism, and violence in many forms. I am not suggesting we ignore their grievances, but that we help white working people understand the source of their discontent¡ªreal and imagined. 
Is this possible? The struggle to recruit the white working class is an old story. Black movement leaders have been trying to free white working people from the paltry wages of whiteness since Reconstruction, at least, and it seems to always end badly. This history is not necessarily legible because we tend to conflate populism and fascism with what Henry Giroux astutely identifies as authoritarianism. Populism is the idea that ordinary people ought to have the power to control their government and their communities, especially along lines that benefit the collective. In the 1880s and ¡¯90s, the black populist movement adopted a vision of a new society based on cooperative economics. The great writer and activist Timothy Thomas Fortune gave their unique vision eloquent voice and plans for action in his book Black and White: Land, Labor and Politics in the South (1884), which offered a path for the emancipation of the nation as a whole, not just black people. He attacked America¡¯s betrayal of Reconstruction, identified monopoly and private ownership of land as the central source of inequality, and articulated a vision of a democratic, caring political economy based on equity and fairness. The National Colored Alliance members had advanced beyond printing more money or demanding free silver, adopting instead a more radical redistribution of wealth and power. They wanted more than a short-term alliance just to raise wages for picking cotton or reducing debt. But Fortune understood that a genuine cooperative commonwealth is not possible unless white workers and farmers join the movement. ¡°The hour is approaching,¡± he wrote, ¡°when the laboring classes of our country, North, East, West and South, will recognize that they have a common cause, a common humanity and a common enemy; and that, therefore, if they would triumph over wrong and place the laurel wreath upon triumphant justice, without distinction of race or of previous condition they must unite!¡± Whatever unity they managed to create proved ephemeral. As in so many other scenarios, most whites chose white supremacy over liberation. 
The lessons here are crucial. We cannot build a sustainable movement without a paradigm shift. Stopgap, utilitarian alliances to stop Trump aren¡¯t enough. I concur with Giroux, who calls on all of us to wage ¡°an anti-fascist struggle that is not simply about remaking economic structures, but also about refashioning identities, values, and social relations as part of a democratic project that reconfigures what it means to desire a better and more democratic future.¡± Robin Davis Gibran Kelley is the Gary B.

Donald J. Trump¡¯s 10 Point Plan to Put America First: A Response by Tanya Golash-Boza 
""It will be difficult for a Trump administration to exceed the 2011 levels and it will take time to rebuild this deportation machine."" 
With the election of Donald J. Trump to the Presidency of the United States, many undocumented immigrants and their family members are concerned about their future in this country. How much worse will the United States get with a Trump Presidency? Although politicians do not always live up to their campaign promises, it is worth taking a look at Trump¡¯s proposals to see how likely and/or feasible they are. 
1. ¡°Begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border, on day one. Mexico will pay for the wall. ¡± 
There is already a 700-mile wall along the border. Much of the remaining area where there is not a wall is impassable. Building more walls or fencing along the border will require Congressional appropriations. Congress may balk at the extraordinary cost, especially given the fact that border crossings are at a historic low . Whatever money ends up being spent will be a colossal waste of funds. 
2. ¡°End catch-and-release. Under a Trump administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country.¡± 
Detention centers are currently at full capacity, both at the border and in the interior. Detaining more immigrants would require building more facilities or finding places to detain people. This is possible, but will be costly. Stock in the two major private prison companies (CCA and GEO group) shot up with the announcement of Trump¡¯s win. These companies likely are willing to sell additional detention capacity to the Department of Homeland Security, but there are limits to how much capacity they can provide immediately. It is also possible for the Trump administration to use tent camps in the borderlands deserts to enhance capacity. If it were up to Trump alone, this is not inconceivable. It is incumbent upon us to ensure that the United States does not go back down that shameful route. 
3. ¡°Move criminal aliens out day one, in joint operations with local, state, and federal law enforcement. We will terminate the Obama administration¡¯s deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets.¡± 
The Obama administration will have deported three million people by the time he leaves office, far more than any previous administration. Here, Trump is referring to the deportation of people with criminal convictions who live in the United States. These are called interior removals, and these reached a historic high in 2011, largely due to cooperation between local police and immigration law enforcement agencies. Returning to these high levels of interior removals would require cooperation with local law enforcement, who may not be on board. It will be difficult for a Trump administration to exceed the 2011 levels and it will take time to rebuild this deportation machine. 
4. ¡°End sanctuary cities.¡± 
Trump could threaten to take away federal funding from sanctuary cities, which would likely lead to massive protest. 
5. ¡°Immediately terminate President Obama¡¯s two illegal executive amnesties. All immigration laws will be enforced - we will triple the number of ICE agents. Anyone who enters the U.S. illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country.¡± 
Trump can (and likely will) end the Deferred Action to Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which has provided employment permits and relief from deportation for undocumented youth. The most likely scenario is that the Trump administration will not renew these permits and they will gradually expire. 
There are currently about 5,000 ICE agents in the United States. Trump could triple that number to 15,000. That still would not be enough agents for ICE to engage in very many direct arrests, which require a lot of manpower. ICE would still rely on local law enforcement to do the bulk of arrests. 
6. ¡°Suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur, until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place.¡± 
This is likely a plan to try and exclude people from certain national origins from entering the United States as all places where visas are issued have extensive screening. Trump likely could do this relatively easily. 
7. ¡°Ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported.¡± 
The countries he may be referring to here are Cuba, China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. These account for a relatively small number of deportees. 
8. ¡°Ensure that a biometric entry-exit visa tracking system is fully implemented at all land, air, and sea ports.¡± 
A biometric entry system is largely in place. A biometric exit system would be much more complicated and costly to implement. It¡¯s not impossible, but would require a lot of Congressional appropriations. 
9. ¡°Turn off the jobs and benefits magnet. Many immigrants come to the U.S. illegally in search of jobs, even though federal law prohibits the employment of illegal immigrants.¡± 
Trump could expand e-verify , which is already in effect at many places of employment. DACA recipients who are employed may lose their jobs. This strategy would push undocumented immigrants to work under the table or to commit identity fraud. It would not make them leave. 
10. ¡°Reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, keeping immigration levels within historic norms.¡± 
It is up to Congress to pass laws regarding immigration flows. A Republican-controlled Congress could re-haul immigration policy to reduce the number of visas that we issue annually, or change the nature of those visas from family-based to skills-based visas. Immigration reform has been stalled in Congress for the entirety of the Obama administration. 
It is very unlikely that Trump will live up to his promise to deport all 11 million undocumented migrants. President Obama deported about three million people during his administration and it will be challenging for Trump to exceed those numbers. If Trump does exceed those numbers, he will do so by building on the massive deportation machine that President Obama has built. This effort will require a massive expansion in the number of ICE agents, the number of detention beds, and the number of immigration judges ¨C an extremely costly endeavor.

Donald Trump is mostly bad news for Africa, including reduced U.S. aid and possibly more support for ¡°imperial African adventurism"" ¨C unless, of course, Africa uses Trump¡¯s lemons to make lemonade. His isolationism ¡°could give Africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops.¡± On climate policy, Trump is an unmitigated disaster. What Does a Trump Victory Mean for Africa? by Patrick Bond 
This article previously appeared in Pambazuka News . 
¡° Trump will sabotage the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and similar strategies to solve global problems.¡± 
The most catastrophic long-term consequence is climate change. This is because Trump is a denialist who will give the green light to widespread fracking, coal and oil exploration. Africa will be the most adversely affected continent. United Nations scientists estimate that 9 out of 10 small-scale farmers are unlikely to farm by 2100 due to drying soils and global warming, plus extreme weather will also cause 180 million unnecessary African deaths by then, according to Christian Aid. 
Under Trump, we can safely predict that Washington will no longer seek to control United Nations climate negotiations, as did Barack Obama¡¯s administration. The WikiLeaks Clinton emails and State Department cables revealed blatant manipulations of the Copenhagen and Durban climate summits. Instead, Trump will simply pull the US out of the 2015 Paris agreement, as did George W. Bush from the Kyoto Protocol. 
By good fortune, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change annual summit is underway this week in Morocco. The only logical move, if the delegates have any spine, is to expel the US State Department and establish the machinery for a major carbon tax applied to products associated with countries ¨C the US especially ¨C which raise emissions and threaten the survival of many species across the globe. 
¡°Trump will simply pull the US out of the 2015 Paris agreement, as did George W. Bush from the Kyoto Protocol.¡± 
Trump also heralds a rise in US racism and xenophobia, parallel to the Brexit vote by the British white working class. In neither case will local solutions be effective for the simple reason that neither Trump nor Theresa May (UK Prime Minister) are interested in the income redistribution required to benefit their economies. 
And African elites who have ¨C with a few exceptions ¨C climbed over each other to please Washington, won¡¯t find themselves welcome in the White House. 
Hopefully the contagion of Trump¡¯s racism ¨C which will make life for Africans much harder ¨C will be met by a major resistance movement including Africans from all walks of life in solidarity with various groups that stand to be oppressed by the US ¨C women, African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims, environmentalists, progressives of all sorts. This movement can shape up in the same spirit to those that gave solidarity during the fight against apartheid. 
What are the likely economic consequences? 
Consistent with his isolationism, world trade stagnation will continue. In the case of Africa, Trump is likely to retract benefits under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act and reduce US aid. 
That isolationism, in turn, could give Africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops. Africa must focus on localizing its economies to be able to meet basic needs. 
Trump¡¯s hatred of what he terms the ¡°globalists¡± is probably just hot electioneering rhetoric. It¡¯s fair to predict that pro-corporate candidates will come forward as Trump allies to calm the crashing stock markets. 
The ¡°neoliberal¡± group of policy wonks who expressed disgust with Trump and favored Hillary Clinton will quickly make inroads into the new administration. They will ensure that the continuing US dominance in Western-leaning multilateral institutions is not disturbed. 
We can simply anticipate more brazen US self-interest, as witnessed during the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush regimes, with less of the confusing rhetoric promoted by Obama and his allies. 
What US policies on Africa are likely to change? With what impact? 
To be frank, we can only offer guesses. Trump said literally nothing about Africa during his campaign. He wants to ¡°rebuild US military power,¡± which might include strengthening the Pentagon¡¯s controversial Africa Command, known as Africom. 
Economically, it is worth noting Trump¡¯s close relations to the oil and gas industry which comes via Vice President Mike Pence. This suggests that multinational corporations in the extractive industries who desire more explicit imperial support for African adventurism will be served well by Trump¡¯s bully-boy mentality. 
What does this mean for multilateral institutions and how will this affect Africa? 
The US¡¯s role in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will become nastier given the veto power it enjoys, holding more than 15% of the voting shares. Trump will probably hire a brutal neoliberal as his IMF executive director, someone who will tighten the screws on Africa using Washington¡¯s veto power. The leaders of two big African economies are desperate for IMF credits: Nigeria ($29 billion) and Egypt ($12 billion). 
In relation to the United Nations, an interesting question comes to mind: should the UN leadership now sitting in Trump¡¯s Manhattan East Side neighborhood not develop a contingency plan to move UN headquarters out of the US? Trump promises to make life very hard for visitors who are Muslims, Libyans, Syrians and Mexicans ¨C amongst others ¨C so holding multilateral events in the US may soon be impossible. 
The period ahead demands a very different multilateralism due to a number of expectations. The first is that Trump will sabotage the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and similar strategies to solve global problems, and wreck nuclear non-proliferation strategies such as the agreement that Obama painstakingly reached with Iran earlier this year. 
And the second is that three of the BRICS¡¯ nationalistic leaders ¨C Vladimir Putin in Russia, Nahendra Modi in India and Michel Temer in Brazil ¨C can be expected to establish much closer ties to Trump. This is likely to affect the balance of power between geographical regions, added to which are the drift of Pakistan, Turkey and the Philippines away from Washington. Trump¡¯s hatred of China is another indeterminate factor. 
Regardless of the geopolitical maneuvers, it¡¯s time for a ¡®multilateralism-from-below¡¯ in which traditional progressive movements in civil society find common cause, because this is the most serious threat to humanity, the world economy and environment we¡¯ve seen in living memory.

How will Donald Trump¡¯s rhetoric on removing what he calls ¡°illegal aliens¡± be put into actual policy? One thing is certain: It will take a lot more than even a tripling of the current ICE force of 5,000 to surpass President Obama¡¯s record-breaking deportations. ¡°ICE would still rely on local law enforcement to do the bulk of arrests.¡± Congress would also have to revise existing immigration laws. Donald J. Trump¡¯s 10 Point Plan to Put America First: A Response by Tanya Golash-Boza 
""It will be difficult for a Trump administration to exceed the 2011 levels and it will take time to rebuild this deportation machine."" 
With the election of Donald J. Trump to the Presidency of the United States, many undocumented immigrants and their family members are concerned about their future in this country. How much worse will the United States get with a Trump Presidency? Although politicians do not always live up to their campaign promises, it is worth taking a look at Trump¡¯s proposals to see how likely and/or feasible they are. 
1. ¡°Begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border, on day one. Mexico will pay for the wall. ¡± 
There is already a 700-mile wall along the border. Much of the remaining area where there is not a wall is impassable. Building more walls or fencing along the border will require Congressional appropriations. Congress may balk at the extraordinary cost, especially given the fact that border crossings are at a historic low . Whatever money ends up being spent will be a colossal waste of funds. 
2. ¡°End catch-and-release. Under a Trump administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country.¡±

The American journalist, Edward Bernays, is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. 
The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho-analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term ¡°public relations¡± as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions. 
In 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade ¨C behaviour then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, ¡°Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!¡± 
Bernays¡¯ influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret, he said, was ¡°engineering the consent¡± of people in order to ¡°control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it¡±. 
He described this as ¡°the true ruling power in our society¡± and called it an ¡°invisible government¡±. 
Freud had a cousin called Edward Bernays, who has since earned the title ¡°father of Public Relations¡±. Bernays took Freud¡¯s idea and applied it to consumers. If desire is our driving force, then appealing to emotions is the most powerful way to persuade consumers to act. The idea was to short circuit their rational conscious and get them where they were most vulnerable ¨C the unconscious 
Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. 
Imagine two cities. Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties. 
In the second city ¨C in another country nearby ¨C almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. 
The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by ¡°us¡±¨C by the United States and Britain. They even have a media centre that is funded by Britain and America. 
Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys, condemned for assaulting and bombing the city ¨C which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city. 
Confusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad. 
Iraq War as portrayed on two popular American news magazines. Terrorists and hero savours are typical propaganda images 
What is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. 
Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today. 
Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was ¡°vindicated¡± for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell¡¯s fabrications.The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, ¡°What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?¡± 
He replied that if journalists had done their job, ¡°there is a very, very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq¡±. 
It was a shocking statement, and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question ¡ª Dan Rather of CBS, David Rose of the Observer and journalists and producers in the BBC, who wished to remain anonymous. 
In other words, had journalists done their job, had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children would be alive today, and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul. 
There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on 7th July 2005. There would have been no flight of millions of refugees; there would be no miserable camps. 
When the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November, President Francoise Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria ¨C and more terrorism followed, predictably, the product of Hollande¡¯s bombast about France being ¡°at war¡± and ¡°showing no mercy¡±. That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak. 
¡°When the truth is replaced by silence,¡± said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko, ¡°the silence is a lie.¡± 
The attack on Iraq, the attack on Libya, the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West. The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant. They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country. 
The same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an ¡°agreement¡± that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy. His people were bombed, and he was prosecuted in The Hague. Independence of this kind is intolerable. 
As WikLeaks has revealed, it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, that he was attacked. 
From that moment, the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics ¨C the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage. 
Why is this not news? The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross, who was responsible for operating sanctions against Iraq, told me: ¡°We would feed journalists factoids of sanitised intelligence, or we would freeze them out. That is how it worked.¡± 

Propaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education ¨C Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Columbia ¡ª and with careers on the BBC, the Guardian, the New York Times, the Washington Post. 
These organisations are known as the liberal media. They present themselves as enlightened, progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist. They are anti-racist, pro-feminist and pro-LGBT. 
And they love war. 
While they speak up for feminism, they support rapacious wars that deny the rights of countless women, including the right to life. 
Daily Mail 25 Oct 2011: reports that ¡°A Libyan revolutionary fighter has bragged in a leaked video that he was the man who killed Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, that country¡¯s despotic former ruler. The young man, who is pictured but has not yet been identified, said he killed the fallen dictator because he could not bear the thought of taking him alive.¡± 
In 2011, Libya, then a modern state, was destroyed on the pretext that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit genocide on his own people. That was the incessant news; and there was no evidence. It was a lie. 
In fact, Britain, Europe and the United States wanted what they like to call ¡°regime change¡± in Libya, the biggest oil producer in Africa. Gaddafi¡¯s influence in the continent and, above all, his independence were intolerable. 
So he was murdered with a knife in his rear by fanatics, backed by America, Britain and France. Hillary Clinton cheered his gruesome death for the camera, declaring, ¡°We came, we saw, he died!¡± 
The destruction of Libya was a media triumph. As the war drums were beaten, Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian: ¡°Though the risks are very real, the case for intervention remains strong.¡± 
Intervention ¨C what a polite, benign, Guardian word, whose real meaning, for Libya, was death and destruction. 
According to its own records, Nato launched 9,700 ¡°strike sorties¡± against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. They included missiles with uranium warheads. Look at the photographs of the rubble of Misurata and Sirte, and the mass graves identified by the Red Cross. The Unicef report on the children killed says, ¡°most [of them] under the age of ten¡±. 
As a direct consequence, Sirte became the capital of ISIS. Ukraine is another media triumph. Respectable liberal newspapers such as the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Guardian, and mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC, NBC, CBS, CNN have played a critical role in conditioning their viewers to accept a new and dangerous cold war. 
All have misrepresented events in Ukraine as a malign act by Russia when, in fact, the coup in Ukraine in 2014 was the work of the United States, aided by Germany and Nato. 
This inversion of reality is so pervasive that Washington¡¯s military intimidation of Russia is not news; it is suppressed behind a smear and scare campaign of the kind I grew up with during the first cold war. Once again, the Ruskies are coming to get us, led by another Stalin, whom The Economist depicts as the devil. 
The suppression of the truth about Ukraine is one of the most complete news blackouts I can remember. The fascists who engineered the coup in Kiev are the same breed that backed the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Of all the scares about the rise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe, no leader ever mentions the fascists in Ukraine ¨C except Vladimir Putin, but he does not count. 
Many in the Western media have worked hard to present the ethnic Russian-speaking population of Ukraine as outsiders in their own country, as agents of Moscow, almost never as Ukrainians seeking a federation within Ukraine and as Ukrainian citizens resisting a foreign-orchestrated coup against their elected government. 
There is almost the joie d¡¯esprit of a class reunion of warmongers. The drum-beaters of the Washington Post inciting war with Russia are the very same editorial writers who published the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. 
To most of us, the American presidential campaign is a media freak show, in which Donald Trump is the arch villain. But Trump is loathed by those with power in the United States for reasons that have little to do with his obnoxious behaviour and opinions. To the invisible government in Washington, the unpredictable Trump is an obstacle to America¡¯s design for the 21st century. 
This is to maintain the dominance of the United States and to subjugate Russia, and, if possible, China. 
To the militarists in Washington, the real problem with Trump is that, in his lucid moments, he seems not to want a war with Russia; he wants to talk with the Russian president, not fight him; he says he wants to talk with the president of China. 
In the first debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump promised not to be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into a conflict. He said, ¡°I would certainly not do first strike. Once the nuclear alternative happens, it¡¯s over.¡± That was not news. 
Did he really mean it? Who knows? He often contradicts himself. But what is clear is that Trump is considered a serious threat to the status quo maintained by the vast national security machine that runs the United States, regardless of who is in the White House. 
Anti-Trump Boston Globe Sunday Edition Crosses the Line From News into Propaganda 
The CIA wants him beaten. The Pentagon wants him beaten. The media wants him beaten. Even his own party wants him beaten. He is a threat to the rulers of the world ¨C unlike Clinton who has left no doubt she is prepared to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and China. 
Clinton has the form, as she often boasts. Indeed, her record is proven. As a senator, she backed the bloodbath in Iraq. When she ran against Obama in 2008, she threatened to ¡°totally obliterate¡± Iran. As Secretary of State, she colluded in the destruction of governments in Libya and Honduras and set in train the baiting of China. 
She has now pledged to support a No Fly Zone in Syria ¨C a direct provocation for war with Russia. Clinton may well become the most dangerous president of the United States in my lifetime ¨C a distinction for which the competition is fierce. 
Without a shred of evidence, she has accused Russia of supporting Trump and hacking her emails. Released by WikiLeaks, these emails tell us that what Clinton says in private, in speeches to the rich and powerful, is the opposite of what she says in public. 
That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders. 
Today, the greatest build-up of American-led forces since World War Two is under way ¨C in the Caucasus and eastern Europe, on the border with Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, where China is the target. 
Keep that in mind when the presidential election circus reaches its finale on November 8th, If the winner is Clinton, a Greek chorus of witless commentators will celebrate her coronation as a great step forward for women. None will mention Clinton¡¯s victims: the women of Syria, the women of Iraq, the women of Libya. None will mention the civil defence drills being conducted in Russia. None will recall Edward Bernays¡¯¡°torches of freedom¡±. 
George Bush¡¯s press spokesman once called the media ¡°complicit enablers¡±. 
Coming from a senior official in an administration whose lies, enabled by the media, caused such suffering, that description is a warning from history. 
In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German media: ¡°Before every major aggression, they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically for the attack. In the propaganda system, it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons.¡±

26 Oct, 2016 26  
On Tuesday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump received the endorsement of the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association in Miami, the first such endorsement in the history of the anti-communist group. ¡°Our decision was a no-brainer,¡± a representative of the veterans group said in his introduction to the candidate, noting that the group had become increasingly concerned that ¡°corruption in our public life has become rampant and has to be stopped,¡± and that they could not trust the ¡°socialist progressive agenda of Hillary Clinton.¡±
 
¡°We only ask of Mr. Trump that the fundamental values animating his campaign ¨C to restore truth and justice in our political system and public life ¨C be deemed equally necessary for the oppressed people of Cuba in their struggle to be free,¡± he added.

Taking the podium to chants of ¡°USA! USA!¡±, Trump said he was ¡°humbled by this endorsement from true freedom fighters¡± and recognized the Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), a Cuban dissident organization composed of the wives, mothers, daughters, and sisters of political prisoners. ¡°They march quietly to church every Sunday and¡­ are subject to physical and verbal violence and abuse by government-sanctioned mobs,¡± Trump noted, adding that Clinton ¡°turns a blind eye to the human rights violations that occur every single day.¡±
Miami¡¯s Bay of Pigs Museum is a spiritual home for the Brigada 2506, the official name of the Cuban freedom fighters who embarked on the mission to overthrow Castro in 1961. It features a wall commemorating the martyrs killed during the operation ¨C including a number of non-Cuban American fighters ¨C as well as a variety of memorabilia from both the operation and Cuban history generally, including a collection of the flags used throughout the island¡¯s history.
Bay of Pigs veterans have nearly unanimously asserted that the mission to free Cuba failed because leftist icon president John F. Kennedy failed to provide the air support the group had been promised after the fighters had deployed. Air support was critical to the design of the military operation.

Trump¡¯s visit highlights the largely adversarial relationship Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, have maintained with the Cuban exile community in the United States.
The Clinton presidency is stained with the blood of dozens of Cubans seeking freedom. Among them are the 41 killed in July 1994, when the Cuban government sunk the ¡°March 13¡± tugboat , seeking to arrive in the United States. Cuban government officials killed ten children between the ages of 6 months and 12 years in that operation; the Clinton White House did not issue a significant response to this act.
In 1996, the Cuban government shot down two planes belonging to the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue in international waters, killing four Cuban-Americans, including U.S. citizens. Bill Clinton said of the attack , ¡°this shooting of civilian aircraft out of the air was a flagrant violation of international law. It is wrong and the United States will not tolerate it.¡± The Cuban government never faced trial for this violation, however, or significant repercussions for the act.
Towards the end of the Clinton tenure, in 2000, Clinton ordered the siege of a residential home in Miami, where Cuban exile child Eli¨¢n Gonz¨¢lez, 7 years old, was residing with his family. Gonz¨¢lez was abducted from his home at gunpoint and returned to Cuba in an operation observers at the time described as ¡°resembl[ing] Munich 1940 more than Miami 2000.¡±
Gonz¨¢lez, now an adult, is a prominent communist propaganda figure .
Hillary Clinton herself has said that she supports President Barack Obama¡¯s concessions to the Castro regime announced on December 2014. While she was no longer his Secretary of State at the time, she took credit for his Cuba policies in her autobiography, Hard Choices . Since the Obama concession package, both violent arrests of dissidents and dangerous attempts to flee Cuba for the United States via the Caribbean Sea have skyrocketed.
A series of releases of emails from the organization Wikileaks shows that Clinton insiders, including campaign chairman John Podesta, are intimately acquainted with advocates for furthering business ties and emboldening the Castro regime, and that these advocates have influences Clinton¡¯s public statements on the issue.

(REUTERS) U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Democrat Hillary Clinton¡¯s plan for Syria would ¡°lead to World War Three,¡± because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear-armed Russia.
 
In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State is a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy.
¡­
¡°What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,¡± said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. ¡°You¡¯re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.
¡°You¡¯re not fighting Syria any more, you¡¯re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,¡± he said.

Speaking to the group of neoconservative elites, Trump said, ¡°These are people who have done good things, heroic things for America. Heroes.

If this doesn¡¯t prove what¡¯s beautiful about America, we don¡¯t know what does. 
Politically, Sarah Goodwin and Colleen Cassidy agree on almost nothing. They vehemently oppose the other¡¯s candidate of choice and couldn¡¯t differ more on the direction our country should be heading in. Yet, as this heatedly divisive election cycle comes to a head, these two demonstrated just how powerful a united American people can be when we put our differences aside and work together: Sarah, a Trump supporter, and Colleen, a Clinton supporter, held each other¡¯s hair back while vomiting out of intense election anxiety. 
In a campaign season as contentious as this one, you really have to stop and appreciate moments like this. 
Though Sarah and Colleen come from opposite ends of the political spectrum, you wouldn¡¯t know it when looking into the stall at their polling station in Cranford, NJ, where they both lowered their heads into the same trash can and took turns holding each other¡¯s hair back as they retched over the psychological toll this long, strenuous election¡¯s taken on them. No arguing, no finger-pointing, no name-calling: just dual streams of stress-induced upchuck crescendoing in a duet of dry-heaving. The sight of two people, who have been bombarded for months with messages that the other candidate will completely ruin the country as they know it, patting one another on the back and encouraging each other to get it all out, is all too welcome in an otherwise toxic and polarizing campaign season. 
Need more proof that it¡¯s possible for Trump and Clinton supporters to overcome their shared animosity during this historical moment of anxiety? Colleen even offered Sarah an Altoid once they¡¯d both stopped throwing up and cleaned the barf from their shirts. Further, Sarah graciously let Colleen borrow her eyeliner, which had been smudged due to the tears summoned by a panic attack she experienced while in line to vote. After checking in to make sure the other was feeling all right one last time, each went their separate ways, having found rare common ground with their political opposites in the form of sickening anxiety stoked by the intense fear politics and extremist partisan rhetoric deployed in the 2016 election. 
Yup, the spirit of Abraham Lincoln is alive, knitting a torn nation back together. 
Look at the media and you¡¯ll see interactions between Trump and Clinton supporters portrayed as vitriolic and irreconcilably at odds. But in reality, you¡¯ll find two human beings offering each other their sleeves to wipe the sick from their mouths before they head back out there to get this goddamn fucking thing over with, and that¡¯s worth celebrating.",english,2016-11-09T00:24:44.324+02:00,clickhole.com,US,16425,Life: The Power Of Unity: This Trump Supporter And Clinton Supporter Held Each Other¡¯s Hair While Vomiting Out Of Election Anxiety,0,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3445/9/16x9/1200.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,satire,Negative

Well, Donald Trump certainly has cause for celebration today. 
Despite having a multi-billion-dollar net worth, an international real estate company, and a primetime television show, Donald Trump¡¯s ambitions were still set higher. The one trophy he¡¯d spent his entire life trying to claim for his mantle of accomplishments had always evaded him¡ªuntil today. By winning the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump is finally able to kick the nation¡¯s most powerful black family out of their house. 
One can only imagine the immense joy Donald¡¯s wife and children feel for him today. 
Trump has been preparing for this moment ever since the Trump Organization first started buying buildings throughout New York City and raising rent for African-Americans until he could toss them out for no longer being able to afford it. Now, after decades of practice and determination, the president-elect will see his magnum opus arrive in the form of booting the incredibly influential and powerful Obama family out of the home they¡¯ve lived in for the past eight years. 
Ejecting black people from their residences has been a lifelong passion for Donald. From practicing discriminatory housing policies that prevented black people from moving into Trump buildings to tagging black people¡¯s rental applications with a separate sheet of paper marked ¡°C¡± for ¡°colored,¡± Donald has never lost focus on his goal. But that was all just warm-up for Trump, who clearly wanted to challenge himself by attempting to evict a wealthy black family of international renown. And when he sends President Obama, Michelle, Malia, Sasha, and all their boxed-up belongings packing from their house in January, Trump will have done just that. 
What a truly stunning feat. With the biggest item on his bucket list now firmly checked off, Trump would be more than justified in resting on his laurels to soak in the consummation of all his dreams. It¡¯s hard to imagine an even more powerful and famous black family Donald could evict, but knowing Trump, he will continue to push himself. Whatever his plans are now, the world will be watching in anxious anticipation.",english,2016-11-09T17:42:19.976+02:00,clickhole.com,US,16425,News: Crowning Achievement: Donald Trump Has Just Accomplished His Lifelong Goal Of Kicking The Nation¡¯s Most Powerful Black Family Out Of Their House,0,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3447/4/16x9/1200.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,satire,Negative

One year ago, I was arrested for both statutory rape and possessing child pornography, and I deeply regret my disgusting crimes. Since that fateful day, I¡¯ve been serving a 16-year jail sentence, using every second of that time to reflect on, and repent for, what I have done. I¡¯ve truly learned a lot about myself as a person, and if our president-elect, Donald Trump, were to recognize my transformation and to pardon me, I would be honored to serve as his Secretary of Agriculture. 
In the event Donald J. Trump pardons and then appoints me to his future Cabinet, I, Jared Fogle, current federal inmate and former Subway spokesperson, could think of no greater privilege than to serve our commander in chief, and our country, as the head of our Department of Agriculture. 
It is the Secretary of Agriculture¡¯s sworn duty to provide assistance to our nation¡¯s farmers, as well as to protect farmland and enforce food safety, and if I am let out of jail, I believe I am ready for the task. To have Donald Trump both forgive my child-sex crimes and recognize how useful my deep knowledge of lettuce, tomatoes, onions, peppers, hot Italian peppers, olives, and other sub toppings could be to his administration would make my heart swell with pride. 
To serve our farmers at the federal level would be greater than any Subway sandwich I ever ate, greater than any Subway commercial I ever made, and greater than any large pair of pants I ever wore. 
As someone who has sold hundreds of millions of Subway sandwiches to the American people since the year 2000, I know the burden of working for the public, and I would not let our new president, nor the American people, down. It would be an immense privilege to serve for a full four years, and pending Donald Trump negating my seven federal counts of production of child pornography, I would start that process immediately. 
I lost over 245 pounds and ate thousands of Subway sandwiches before I was arrested for paying for sex with a minor, and I do hope that President-elect Trump considers that fact when making his decision whether or not to pardon and appoint me secretary of agriculture. To serve our farmers at the federal level would be greater than any Subway sandwich I ever ate, greater than any Subway commercial I ever made, and greater than any large pair of pants I ever wore. 
So, hopefully, the next time I address you, it will be not from my prison cell in Englewood Federal Correctional Institution but from the National Mall, in Washington, D.C.

With protests erupting across the country this week and emotions running high, American companies are trying to make sense of how to react to a Trump presidential election win. But one major company has clearly made up its mind and just came down squarely in the anti-Trump camp in a big way: Donald Trump will be added to Disney¡¯s Hall Of Presidents, but his animatronic figure will be able to feel pain. 
Wow. Disney just showed that it does not pull punches when it comes to what the company believes in. Check out the press release they put out this morning: 
¡°Disney prides itself on promoting inclusivity, empathy, and non-violence, which are values that Mr. Trump¡¯s presidency threatens. That¡¯s why when we eventually add him to our Hall Of Presidents exhibit in Disney World¡¯s Magic Kingdom, his mechanical replica will bear the capacity to suffer horribly, and without limit. Being a company that caters to diverse families, we felt it was a moral responsibility to have Mr. Trump¡¯s robotic counterpart be receptive to extreme thirst and burning sensations, while also being wired with the knowledge that it can never receive the sweet mercy of death. This is the best way for us to uphold the Hall Of Presidents tradition while also voicing our vigorous objection to the Trump administration.¡± 
Given that Disney¡¯s software makes the animatronic believe its bones are shattering each time it moves or speaks, this company clearly wants people to know it¡¯s not onboard the Trump train. 
Park visitors who feel similarly opposed to Trump¡¯s presidency can rest assured that his Hall Of Presidents double will be designed to experience anxiety, so it¡¯s always aware that more pain is coming. Although the machine will understand what joy is, its programming will never allow it to feel that. 
And Disney¡¯s not letting Trump off the hook there. The replicas for Abraham Lincoln and George Washington will even be reprogrammed to slap, scratch, and pry the fingernails off the animatronic Trump, which will respond to such painful stimuli by gasping, crying, screaming, vomiting, or a mix of all of these. 
If that doesn¡¯t send a powerful statement about where Disney stands politically, we don¡¯t know what does. 
It¡¯s safe to say we won¡¯t see the Trumps vacationing there anytime soon. Don¡¯t share Disney¡¯s disdain for a Trump presidency? You may be better off heading to Space Mountain instead of the Hall Of Presidents, because Disney has officially drawn the battle line right there.

Time to say goodbye to politics as usual. 
In another stunning game changer that has further upended the political establishment, President-elect Donald Trump this morning announced the nomination of a mysterious cloaked man to serve as his secretary of the Hook. 
Yep. Trump promised change, and right away he¡¯s appointing a nameless robed man to lead the Department of the Hook. How¡¯s that for a shock to the system? 
The silent man, whose face is completely shrouded within a thick, hooded cloak, is rumored to have topped the shortlist of candidates for secretary of the Hook after emerging alone from a dense forest at night and immediately causing all greenery within the Washington beltway to wilt. 
Trump has already lauded his nominee as ¡°a wonderful man with an absolutely tremendous cloak¡± whom he trusts do an ¡°unbelievable job¡± discharging the duties of the position, which include abiding by the Hook, interpreting the Covenant of the Hook, and holding aloft the candle whose flame subtracts light from its surroundings. 
¡°The man in the cloak is going to be a fantastic secretary of the Hook. Just fantastic,¡± said Trump, who added that the secretary will be second in the presidential line of succession. ¡°No one is better qualified to enforce the covenant than this man. His cloak is dark, he was born before Christ, I don¡¯t know his name, he has the Hook now, and he¡¯s ready to fight for us!¡± 
And don¡¯t look now, but the presumptive secretary of the Hook is already making waves. At dawn this morning, he led the Zealots of the Hook in a procession through the streets of Washington, toward the open entrance to the Onyx Pyramid, an edifice by the Lincoln Memorial that residents could not remember ever having existed but that the cloaked man assured Americans in a terse press release ¡°has always been and shall forever be.¡±

Wow. Major props to Vanessa for getting herself prepared! 
With just a few short months before the president-elect comes to power, Vanessa has been taking herself out into the world every single day and soaking up as much human dignity as time permits. Whether she¡¯s at home, at work, running errands, or even at the gym, Vanessa is seizing every chance to feel like a respected, autonomous human being before it all gets taken away from her on January 20. 
She now basks in the joy of visiting her doctor, unencumbered by the decisions others will soon make on her behalf. She relishes every interaction with her male coworkers while she still gets to feel like their peer. And she loves taking daily jogs around her neighborhood, savoring every last minute of the relative safety she temporarily still feels. 
¡°It¡¯s getting down to the wire, but I¡¯m just focused on hoarding as many normal human experiences as I can,¡± noted Vanessa, standing in the middle of her local grocery store and reveling in the feeling of having most of her civil rights intact. ¡°I don¡¯t know how many moments like these I¡¯ll get to have, so I figure I should stockpile some for the next four to eight years before it¡¯s too late.¡±

A healthy democracy allows dissent and debate. However, implying that the president wears a toupee when there is no evidence that he does is a crass breach of proper decorum. 
The presidency is the most hallowed office in our nation, and it is worthy of reverence and decorum at all times. Ideally, this image of Donald Trump¡¯s toupee flying off in the wind would no longer be on our website. Since this is currently impossible, we¡¯ve used the magic of Photoshop to make his head very tall and thin. His identity is obscured. This bald man could be anybody. 4. No matter who is president, you address them as ¡°Sir,¡± not ¡°Donald the Hutt.¡± We would quickly remove this if the American people choose Trump on November 8. 
This degrading Photoshop of President Trump¡¯s face on Jabba the Hutt¡¯s body is immature and degrading, and we¡¯d remove it if we could. Since we currently don¡¯t know how, we¡¯ve at least given him a tie to wear to imbue him with the poise and decorum the presidency confers on all who hold that hallowed office. 5. Comparing President Trump to Adolf Hitler would remain a valid political commentary, but making him bald in addition is completely uncalled for. If Donald Trump is elected, we promise to restore his normal hair to this image. 
Now that the American electorate has chosen Donald Trump to lead our nation, this image depicting him as a bald Adolf Hitler has become an unsubtle and tactless political statement that does not meet our exacting editorial standards. We¡¯ve given President-elect Trump his hair back in an effort to restore his dignity. 6. For now, let us enjoy this humorous Photoshop and its accompanying caption, ¡°I am going to build a wig, and Mexico is going to pay for it.¡± During a Trump presidency, it would no longer have a place in the national discourse. 
All right, that¡¯s all of them. We¡¯ve stretched out President-elect Donald Trump¡¯s face all wide so that nobody will know that he is the bald man in this picture. Hopefully, we¡¯ll find a way to remove these pictures from our website, but until then, this will have to do.",english,2016-11-15T19:23:15.331+02:00,clickhole.com,US,16425,"Life: We Don¡¯t Know How To Take Down These Photoshops Of Bald Donald Trump, So We¡¯ve Stretched His Face Out All Wide So Nobody Can Recognize It¡¯s Him",0,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3466/4/16x9/1200.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,satire,Negative

It looks like President-elect Donald Trump is wasting no time making his mark on Washington. He¡¯s already gotten to work appointing his new Cabinet members and laying the groundwork for his new administration. And if it wasn¡¯t already clear that things are going to be done Trump¡¯s way for the next four years, Donald Trump just whispered ¡°Hope you like to make ham, motherfucker¡± to a White House executive chef. 
Wow! It looks like Washington is going to be a very different place under President Trump! 
Those who witnessed the encounter say that, during a recent visit to the White House, Trump caught sight of a high-ranking member of the White House kitchen, waved him over, and said, ¡°Come here, let me talk to you a minute,¡± in a voice that was somehow both cordial and threatening. When the chef got close to Trump, the president-elect shook his hand, pulled him close, and began whispering that once he got sworn in, the chef would be doing nothing but cooking him ham 24/7. 
Members of the White House staff overheard the phrases ¡°Ham is your life now, idiot¡± and ¡°I don¡¯t care what else you can cook. I only want ham¡± as Trump whispered to the chef, whose eyes grew wide with silent fear as he listened to what our nation¡¯s newest president was telling him. They also say that Trump briefly smiled to wave to photographers before turning back to the chef with a dark and menacing expression on his face to continue whispering about ham. 
Now that¡¯s the sign of a president who isn¡¯t afraid to shake things up! 
While many Americans are deeply troubled by the bigoted rhetoric of Trump¡¯s presidential campaign, those who voted for him as a protest against the political establishment have got to be pretty happy about a story like this one! No other president would grab a White House chef by the hand and whisper, ¡°You live in Ham World now, motherfucker!¡± 
And it seems as if President-elect Trump has a concrete plan in place, as well! Trump didn¡¯t just tell the White House chef that he wanted ham in general; he had specific types of ham that he wanted, including ¡°baked ham,¡± ¡°smoked ham all the time,¡± and ¡°ham with frosting.¡± Trump was also overheard telling the White House chef, ¡°You¡¯re also going to be making something called a Pork Jackhammer, which I just invented during the limo ride over here. It¡¯s incredibly dangerous to make, and I want to eat it every day.¡± 
It definitely looks like this is going to be a new era in Washington! You just know it¡¯s not going to be business as usual in D.C. anymore when Donald Trump isn¡¯t afraid to look a White House chef right in the eye and say, ¡°When I ask for Chinese food, that just means soy sauce on ham. When I ask for sushi, that¡¯s raw ham. President Trump will be eating barges of ham for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The moment I take the oath of office is the moment that your world becomes a pork-fueled hellscape.¡± 
People who voted for Trump wanted a maverick, and it looks like they got one! 
After about two minutes of whispering ham-related threats, Trump stepped away from the chef and began smiling and waving at the surrounding press as if nothing had happened, but his message was clear: When Donald Trump becomes president, he¡¯s going to play by his own rules, and he¡¯s only going to eat ham! If President Trump has his way, life in the White House might become completely unrecognizable!",english,2016-11-15T21:05:03.756+02:00,clickhole.com,US,16425,"News: A New Era: Donald Trump Just Whispered ¡®Hope You Like To Make Ham, Motherfucker¡¯ To A White House Chef",0,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3466/5/16x9/1200.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,satire,Negative

Donald Trump¡¯s inauguration may be months from now, but it looks like his Oval Office transition is already well under way. In addition to naming Reince Priebus his chief of staff and meeting with advisors on policy issues, Trump had to schedule in some time this week to go around to houses in the White House¡¯s neighborhood and inform residents that he¡¯s moving in down the street. 
Looks like Trump is not wasting any time preparing for his big move to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.¡°Hello, my name is Donald Trump, and as a new resident in this community, I am required to inform you that I have a history of sexually assaulting women,¡± said the president-elect while standing on one of his new neighbor¡¯s doorsteps. ¡°In the past, I have grabbed women inappropriately, made multiple unwanted advances toward women, and harassed women with vulgar and inflammatory language. For this reason, I have to go door to door telling residents of my new presence in the neighborhood. Sorry to bother you, and have a nice day.¡± 
After spending most of Tuesday exploring potential cabinet picks, Trump was later spotted going around the White House¡¯s neighborhood and knocking on doors, continuing to alert his new neighbors to his history of sexual assault. Standing awkwardly on front porches and avoiding eye contact, Trump promised local residents that he wouldn¡¯t cause any trouble for them or their families and planned to mostly keep to himself for the next four years as president of the United States. He then finished the day by meeting with several economic advisors. 
It¡¯ll be interesting to see what a Trump presidency might look like as he spends the next few days crafting policy goals and reassuring his new neighbors that his motorcade will take alternate routes to ensure that he is never within a hundred yards of a school. If he keeps making the rounds at this pace, it won¡¯t be long before all of the residents of Pennsylvania Avenue have been made aware of his record of sexual assault. 
President Obama still has a few more months left in the White House, but pretty soon Trump will be moving in. So far, the president-elect seems determined to make that transition as smooth as possible for him, his fellow Republicans, and the local residents whom he has been individually informing of his status as a sexual predator.",english,2016-11-16T22:46:52.808+02:00,clickhole.com,US,16425,News: First Steps: Donald Trump Has To Go Around The White House¡¯s Neighborhood Letting Residents Know He Is Moving In Down The Street,0,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3467/5/16x9/1200.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,satire,Negative

Get ready for the most heartwarming story you¡¯ll read all day. 
If you met Paul Langdon or Ayesha Qamar on the street, you might think they have nothing in common. Paul is a retired firefighter, Ayesha is a law student. Paul has lived in the same suburb of Columbus for his entire life, Ayesha immigrated to Ohio from Pakistan when she was a teen. Paul is a devout Christian, Ayesha is Muslim. But if you dig a little deeper, you¡¯ll find that they share a common bond: Both Paul and Ayesha have ¡®Trump¡¯ painted on their garages! 
Beautiful! Take a look at the side-by-side pictures above to see just how similar these two really are. 
When Donald Trump announced his campaign last summer, Paul knew he wanted to show his support by painting a large sign of the candidate¡¯s name on his garage door. But Paul probably never would have guessed that one year later, just a few towns over from him, Ayesha¡¯s own garage would be painted with literally the exact same word! Paul and Ayesha may be from totally different walks of life, but when it comes to the name currently painted on their garages, these two have more in common than they ever could have imagined. 
At the end of the day, it doesn¡¯t matter whether their skin is white or brown. It doesn¡¯t matter whether they worship God or Allah. And it doesn¡¯t matter whether the word ¡®Trump¡¯ has been carefully lettered or hastily scrawled across the garage in brusque spray paint. All that matters is the commonality they share in having the word ¡®Trump¡¯ painted on their homes for the entire neighborhood to see. 
Amazing! It just goes to show, you should never judge a book by its cover. 
At a time when our country feels so divided, stories like this one give us hope for humanity. On the surface, Paul and Ayesha couldn¡¯t be more different, but the messages painted or spray-painted across their garages are one in the same. What an amazing reminder that we¡¯re not so different after all!",english,2016-11-18T21:45:28.657+02:00,clickhole.com,US,16425,Life: Finding Common Ground: This White Man And This Muslim Woman Both Have ¡®Trump¡¯ Painted On Their Garages,0,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3472/7/16x9/1200.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,satire,Negative

Posted by Lindsay Hayward | Nov 4, 2016 | Breaking News Hillary Clinton says Trump is ¡°unstable¡± to be president and will start a nuclear war. 
Former president, Bill Clinton, allowed rangers to die in Somalia because he wouldn¡¯t send air support. There were actually 4,417 military deaths from 1993-1996 alone under the reign of Clinton. He obviously rubbed off on his wife for not having any respect at all for our brave men and women in uniform. How to turn $12,000 in retirement savings into $1.3 Millon over the next 5 years.... Read More 
Hillary also denied air support to soldiers in Benghazi who died horrific deaths while she was Secretary of State. 
Ambassador Chris Stevens was brutally beaten to death and murdered in Benghazi, his lifeless body dragged throughout streets of full-fledged violence, terrorists cheering and applauding. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton and President Obama did nothing . 
Except for blame the tragedy on a video at the victims¡¯ military funeral ceremony as their coffins crossed in front of the stage, where Hillary Clinton stood. 
It was a terrorist attack- the attack came in two separate waves, including suicide bombers. WikiLeaks confirms that Hillary told her daughter that she knew it was not because of ¡®some video¡¯. 
So, how else does Bill influence Hillary? Does he encourage her to lie because it¡¯s what he personally does? Or does lying simply come naturally for her? 
Over the past month, WikiLeaks has poured out incriminating evidence proving corruption within our liberal government. 
They¡¯ve also released countless emails exposing the fraudulent activities tied to the Clinton Foundation, which is currently being investigated by the FBI. 
What other shocking lies have been revealed about the Clintons by WikiLeaks? 
¡°Instead of dark and divisive, it¡¯s hopeful and inclusive. It¡¯s big-hearted, not small-minded. It is about lifting people up, not putting them down,¡± Hillary Clinton stated in front of a ¡°massive¡± crowd in Ohio, unveiled to be photo-shopped to include more people than were actually present by duplicating the ones that were already there. Hillary Clinton crowd in Ohio, photoshopping to make her rally look bigger 
¡°It¡¯s a vision that says, and I believe this with all my heart, we are stronger together.¡± Concludes former Secretary of State. 
Words like ¡°hopeful,¡±¡±big-hearted,¡± and ¡°lifting people up¡± are the same cliches she fed the people of Haiti. They bought what she was selling- Americans should not make this grave mistake. This will actually bring about the civil war she speaks of- instead of Haitian immigrants protesting in front of the Clinton Foundation office in NY, all Americans will be protesting in front of the White House in D.C.. 
Clinton warned that Trump could bring the nation to war ¡°because of his unstable character,¡± which is hilarious. 
According to Breitbart , ¡°Clinton specifically referred to the Civil War, suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from Donald Trump.¡± 
Breitbart continues, ¡°Clinton warned that it would only take a few minutes of instability from Trump launching the United States into a full scale nuclear war.¡± 
How can she make a leader of another nation so distrusting of her after she sells them 20% of American uranium, aiding them in building the very nuclear technology she claims they will use? Putin hates her and she¡¯s not even president! 
Hillary Clinton also said, ¡°Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges ¨C the challenge posed by slavery ¨C and we fought a civil war.¡± 
Crooked Hillary Clinton doesn¡¯t reserve the right to quote the great Abraham Lincoln. She is the one with the track record of inflicting people to slavery backed by her actions in Haiti. 
She is full of hypocrisy, her lack of character is exhausting from what¡¯s been provided by WikiLeaks via her own email correspondence. But her own words are what incriminate her the most. 
¡°It was called Hillarycare before Obamacare!¡± Then she claims she never supported Obamacare. 
¡°Chelsea was jogging at the twin towers when they were hit.¡± No, Hillary, Chelsea was just at home, in bed, cited by you after people called you out for lying. Hillary Clinton is a pathological liar. 
She lies about everything, it¡¯s in her nature. Hillary Clinton is a sociopath that lies for no apparent reason. 
Speaking of lies, WikiLeaks also proved that the women suddenly accusing Donald Trump of sexual misconduct were paid by the Clintons. 
It doesn¡¯t take the support of deleted emails to show that women suddenly coming forward (against the only other candidate) with just weeks left until a huge election are obviously meant to shift attention away from the real issues of Hillary¡¯s email server. 
Trump has overcome lies and scandals perpetrated by Hillary Clinton, spewed by the mainstream media as well as our very own president and guess what? He has kept his cool. Donald J. Trump, American strength and integrity. 
Donald Trump has overcome adversity throughout this presidential campaign and shown incredible strength in his character. He¡¯s had to humbly address obvious lies and falsely organized scandals, media slander, biased-coverage, rape-allegations by women he met once and the list just keeps going. 
Not once did President Donald Trump, I mean, republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, get enraged and act like a looney. With everything thrown at him over the past few weeks, he has handled these vicious attacks swimmingly well. 
¡°Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis,¡± she told her supporters. ¡°Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin.¡± 
We need a strong leader, one that is going to bring about change. We need someone who can remain calm when dealing with a crisis, not act petty or prioritize covering up corruption to saving lives. America needs Donald Trump as president. 
Hillary Clinton encourages our own people to fight with one another instead of come together. Vote for Donald Trump, let¡¯s truly stand together as one, against the corruption Americans currently face. 
It¡¯s time American citizens stopped sitting back, accepting another apology from Hillary Clinton for lying. We need to break up with her, not appoint her as leader of our nation. 
Let¡¯s truly make America great again.

Democrats and the lying media slammed Donald Trump for months when he argued that he may not accept the results of the election. Now that he has won, ironically, it has been the media and Hillary¡¯s supporters that are refusing to accept the results of the election.

The United States Supreme Court has ruled that flag burning is constitutionally protected freedom of speech. Now that Donald Trump will be appointing several Conservative Judges to serve on the Court, we can expect that ruling to change in the coming year or so. 
On top of Trump¡¯s comments a year ago, senior members in his administration have indicated President Trump has now made this issue one of this top priorities. Sources argue that soon after President Trump assembles his cabinet and has a Supreme Court Judge nominated, they will move this issue forward immediately to prosecute anyone caught burning the American flag. 
Trump officials argue, ¡°you have the right to peacefully protest and voice your opinion. You do not have the right to burn our Nation¡¯s strongest symbol.¡± 
Liberals just cannot fathom why burning the American flag is bad. They cannot see beyond their own entitlement that millions of brave men and women have given their lives to fight for everything our flag represents. The only bigots I see are the ones burning American flags, attacking Trump supporters, and destroying cities.

President Trump has indicated that he is more than willing to work with everyone in this great Nation so that we can all come together. If you still choose to incite violence, you will be charged with a crime and sent to jail. 
If you are threatening to leave this country, go ahead and leave. We no longer have time to console people who got their feelings hurt or need a nap. We are about to make this country great again by getting people back to work. We are going to instill the idea of being tough and working hard to achieve your goals instead of holding your hand out as if you are entitled to something. 
It¡¯s truly amazing that we finally have a President that will love and respect our military. The American flag is bigger than any of us. It represent decades of sacrifice, bravery, and patriotism. Millions of men and women gave their life so that scumbag liberals have the freedom to cry in the streets and throw temper tantrums when their candidate doesn¡¯t win the election.

Trump has gained the support of many who understand that Democrats have never actually followed through on their promises. They have little to show for supporting liberals but more strife and tension from a black president who promised hope and change. 
Moreover, President Barack Obama has done more to increase racial tension in this country than anyone could have guessed. Many black voters understand that, and they do not see Clinton as someone they can trust to change it. 
Trump has suggested that Democrats have done nothing to help black communities and has pointed out that they often suffer the most from a breakdown of law and order. He has challenged all Americans to think outside the box and vote for someone different ¡ª someone who might actually bring positive changes, such as jobs , to their neighborhoods.

Two women assaulted pro-Trump activist Tim Treadstone after a Trump rally. They broke his phone, punched him and clawed at his face. They were formally charged with assault and battery. 
Around Aug. 12, West Hollywood, California 
On the night of a rally, Tim Treadstone and other Trump supporters were denied access at a popular Mexican restaurant. Other customers began throwing food and screaming at the group. 
During the rally, ¡°a can of Monster energy drink, eggs and dog feces were also thrown at pro-Trump demonstrators.¡±

British national Michael Sandford , 19, tried to take a gun from a local police officer during a Trump rally. He was arrested and reportedly said he intended to use the gun to kill Trump. (The media had no choice but to report this one.)

A breakdown of that poll showed Trump with an advantage over Clinton among independent voters, a shift from the 2012 election in which President Barack Obama won the state by garnering more support from independents than GOP challenger Mitt Romney. 
In Ohio, a poll by Axiom Strategies and the Remington Research Group showed Trump leading Clinton by a score of 46-42. Advertisement - story continues below 
Again, Trump won out over Clinton among independent voters by a margin of 4 points and was showing significant support among voters in cities such as Cincinnati, Dayton and Toledo. Trump and Clinton were essentially tied in the cities of Youngstown, Cleveland and Columbus. 
Another surprise from the Ohio poll was the breakdown of support for the candidates by gender, which seemed to show that Clinton¡¯s alleged massive lead among women has all but vanished, at least in the Buckeye State. 
Female respondents to the poll preferred Clinton to Trump by only 2 points, 45-43. Meanwhile, Trump continued to dominate among male voters, leading his opponent by 13 points, 51-38. 
Of course these numbers could still change over the course of the next two weeks, but far from showing the race to be essentially over already, they instead reveal that Trump has a pretty decent shot at winning two of the most important states when all the votes have been counted after Nov. 8.

Hunter noted the extreme bias exhibited by the media who refused to fact-check Clinton at the last debate, and what he sees as the difference between what a Trump and a Clinton presidency would look like: 
¡°A Trump administration at least will include people I trust in positions that matter.

¡°I¡¯m not saying you should support him, but you shouldn¡¯t lose sight of the importance of opposing her.

Under the Obama administration, NASA has mostly focused on research and development. Space exploration has ground to a halt, thanks to ridiculous restrictions imposed on NASA by Washington politicians who don¡¯t know the first thing about space travel. 
Trump wants America to lead in space once again, and with that in mind he promised more investment in NASA as well as the expansion of current private-public partnerships to maximize America¡¯s potential. 
¡°I will free NASA from the restriction of serving primarily as a logistics agency for low-Earth orbit activity,¡± Trump stated. ¡°Instead, we will refocus its mission on space exploration.¡±   
Years ago, America led the world in space innovation. Astronauts like Neil Armstrong inspired generations of Americans to shoot for the stars . Science and technology programs flourished because America¡¯s children wanted to achieve the impossible. 
That dream has faded as our government has scaled back space programs over time. NASA used to regularly redefine the word ¡°wow,¡± but now all it does is maintain the status quo. 
What Trump is promising is a bright future for America. A revitalized space program would create thousand of jobs, spur advanced technological developments and inspire America¡¯s children to achieve the impossible once again.

Take for example Florida and Nevada, which had been consistently labeled ¡°lean Democrat¡± by CNN but have now been shifted into the ¡°battleground¡± category, according to The Hill . 
The shift was most likely due to a slew of new polls showing the race in Florida to be essentially tied, with some surveys placing Republican nominee Donald Trump up a couple of points while others still showed Clinton with a slight lead. 
The same holds true for Nevada . CNN also listed as ¡°battleground¡± states places like Arizona, North Carolina, Ohio and Utah, even though Trump has shown a consistent lead in a few of those ¡°toss-up¡± states. Advertisement - story continues below 
CNN still predicted a Clinton win, though her possible margin of victory had contracted significantly from previous estimates. 
CNN suspected that Clinton already has the 270 electoral college votes necessary to win via the states they have labeled ¡°lean¡± or ¡°solid Democrat.¡± 
Conversely, it projected that Trump only had about 179 electoral votes in hand from similarly labeled Republican states, leaving about 87 electoral votes up for grabs. 
Of course, as always, the situation remains much more fluid than the media would like to let on, and things can change quite rapidly, particularly considering that Clinton appears to be sliding in many states while Trump is steadily gaining ground across the country.

The Bloomberg Politics Florida Poll surveyed nearly a thousand Florida residents who had either already voted or were committed to vote. The poll¡¯s margin of error was 3 percentage points, according to the New York Post . 
Clinton may like to boast of her lead here and in other key states, but the Florida results made it clear that Americans were still in control of choosing the candidate who becomes our next commander in chief. 
In fact, 64 percent of Florida voters were quoted as saying that America was ¡°on the wrong track¡±¡ª and those voters seemed less likely to vote for Clinton, who represents the status quo of establishment politics. Advertisement - story continues below 
American voting priorities are clear: 21 percent of Floridians said the biggest crisis facing the U.S. was the terrorist threat from the Islamic State group, while 17 percent believed it was unemployment and jobs, 15 percent health care and 13 percent a decline in real income for American workers. 
Clearly, Americans are waking up. They trust Donald Trump to lead us, to keep us safe, to protect the middle class, and to restore an economy that protects the American worker and provides a decent way of life for us all, and for generations to come.

In addition, slightly more Republicans than Democrats have turned in early ballots, so it is likely that he is leading in Florida so far. 
Trump led among independents in Iowa too. 
One state where that has not been the case, however, has been Colorado. However, potentially offsetting that is the fact that, so far, men have turned in almost as many early ballots as women. That has not been the case in other states, and since men tend to support Trump at a higher percentage than women, it¡¯s good news for the Trump camp.

If you are going to wallow in the liberal media mire, though, MSNBC is by far my favorite ¡ª and trust me, a year-and-a-half of observing presidential campaigns has made me quite a connoisseur of the left-slanting morass. 
MSNBC pretends that conservatives and Trump supporters are from another planet ¡ª or, at the very least, another culture, a sort of cargo cult that is to be studied anthropologically but never taken with any seriousness. 
This interaction with MSNBC reporter Jacob Rascon on Wednesday proved what I¡¯m talking about perfectly. He had found a mother and daughter in line, apparently for early voting. They were also African-American, which made them a cargo cult on top of a cargo cult, by liberal media standards.   
However, when he asked them about criticism of Trump¡¯s African-American outreach, the mother and daughter blew him out of the water. 
¡°Well, I think Trump is reaching out to all citizens, including African-Americans,¡± Trina, the daughter, told MSNBC. ¡°He¡¯s trying to address a problem. It should not be a problem if you address there is something wrong, and you have a plan that wants to help people.¡±

Other Republicans have been quick to jump on the issue as well, including vulnerable incumbent GOP senators like Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Roy Blunt of Missouri. 
Should these Republican senators and others maintain a focus on Obamacare during the final two weeks, they stand a good chance of fending off the Democrat effort to wrench control of the Senate away from the GOP. 
The same applies to Trump, should he refrain from media distractions and continue harping on the failures of Obama and his health care law, particularly in hard-hit swing states like Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, to name just a few. 
And he will have Obama to thank personally for paving the way to a Trump presidency through his horribly flawed Obamacare law.

I am very sorry when children have nightmares. I don¡¯t want children to have nightmares. Nobody on Conservative Tribune¡¯s staff wants children to have nightmares. I think I can safely stake that out as our editorial policy without consulting too many of my superiors. 
However, from that starting point on which Ms. Schmidt and I can surely agree, here are two reasons why I believe this story is prima facie bosh. 
Firstly, I question the genesis of this nightmare, and I find it unbelievable that the writer didn¡¯t. Did Schmidt not think that the child¡¯s bad dreams might have been the result not of the perfidy of Donald Trump but of the political leanings and discussions of her parents? If she did, does she not feel that maybe the tone of the piece was out of line? 
Secondly, let¡¯s assume that these parents have been completely unbiased in presenting the election to their children (which I find an unlikely possibility, but hey, it could happen). The world can be a nightmarish place ¡ª and unfortunately, one of the things that makes it that way is an extremist movement connected, however tangentially you believe it to be, to their religion. 
If you want to talk about bad dreams, talk to survivors of the San Bernardino terrorist attack . Talk to survivors of the Boston bombing. Talk to survivors of 9/11 . These people have very real nightmares, sometimes each and every night, about very corporeal things done to them in the name of Islam ¡ª and they¡¯re the ones who survived . 
These aren¡¯t idle thoughts. They are concrete events. 
For that matter, it¡¯s worth pointing out that the same terrorists probably wish to perpetrate the same nightmarish fate (or worse) on this 7-year-old and her family, simply for the crime of being Westernized. Is this what we wish to ignore in the name of making Donald Trump our national bogeyman? 
If Schmidt is so concerned about the nightmares that Trump¡¯s candidacy is giving 7-year-olds, perhaps she ought to go talk to grown men and women who still have those nightmares, thanks to radical Islamic terrorism. 
If the topic of radical Islamism and how to prevent it is so traumatizing to your children, it¡¯s time to turn off the TV instead of blaming those willing to address it.

Both campaigns have been focused on the key state of Florida , a state Trump needs to win. Other key states that both nominees have invested in included Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina.   
Trump has pondered why he hasn¡¯t gotten more credit for hanging tough while the polls show him consistently behind Clinton. That¡¯s a good question, but the answer could be tied up in the fact that liberals have worked tirelessly to skew polls in favor of Clinton. 
Trump also appeared to have a healthy amount of self-confidence ¡ª so much so that he invests his own money in him campaign ¡ª something we haven¡¯t seen from Clinton. Ever. 
Most voters have become painfully aware of how Democrats lie and cheat about almost everything , and having Clinton in the White House would mean that absolutely no one could trust our commander in chief. 
That¡¯s a sobering thought that should make the choice of who to vote for crystal clear.

Many downwardly mobile Americans are confused about what happened to them, which explains the attraction of Donald Trump, who offers few coherent solutions but may have a lasting impact on U.S. relations with the world, says Michael Brenner. 
By Michael Brenner 
Donald Trump most likely will not be elected President. Still, his historic campaign has sent shock waves through the American body politic. All are asking what it means and what it portends. The focus is on America at home rather than abroad. Foreign policy issues have been overshadowed by anxious domestic concerns. 
Moreover, Trump never formulated a coherent view of international issues. Like the average guy, he simply spat out whatever thoughts passed through his head as he had caught snippets of Fox News. Any attempt to discern logic and strategy from Trump¡¯s disjointed exclamations proves frustrating. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. 
Trump¡¯s entire campaign conveyed emotions rather than considered thoughts. It played to the public¡¯s feelings ¨C amplifying them and channeling them into a turbid or opaque brew of primitive slogans. Energy was imparted through unbridled vehemence and the showmanship of the born despot. 
So it is those emotions that we should look at to see what is simmering behind the formal fa?ade of our democracy in action. For they will outlast the election. Therein lies their significance for possible effects on the United States relations with the rest of the world. 
American Nativism 
If there is an appropriate label to stick on this fermenting vat, it is ¡°nativism.¡± By that we mean a rather inchoate mix of atavistic nationalism, xenophobia, aggressiveness, righteous religiosity and racism dressed up as patriotism. Deep-seated sense of grievance and pervasive feelings that the true American has been sold out provide the fuel. 
Each of these elements has precedents in American history and roots in American society. They periodically have surfaced in political movements from the ¡°Know-Nothings¡± who in the 1850s were empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by German and Irish Catholic immigrants, to the paranoia that accompanied the Red Scare in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution and then reappeared with greater intensity in the form of McCarthyism. The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads ¡°Vote Trump¡± on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr) 
Today¡¯s manifestations have a larger economic component. The optimistic creed that has been the lifeblood of America has been sapped by the plight of salaried workers after decades of wealth redistribution upwards, the hollowing out of the country¡¯s industrial core, the financializing of business, and the emergence of a ¡°gig¡± economy that promises only more dislocation, insecurity, skimpy or no benefits, and declining living standards. 
Rugged individualism dictates that individual persons should assume responsibility for their failings; stoic fatalism in the face of external forces that drain all hope is quite another matter. Blame, like discontent, is free-floating. Its locus shifts among Wall Street, government leaders, and foreigners. 
The last most interests us here. Factors originating beyond the nation¡¯s borders are prominent targets. They range from ¡°globalization¡± as an abstract new reality, to Benedict Arnold companies that off-shore jobs and tax liabilities, to U.S. leaders who sign away American interests in one-sided trade deals to hostile governments who are cheaters. 
Sold Out 
There is more than a grain of truth in the complaints directed at all of those mentioned. The ¡°common man,¡± as we quaintly used to call workers, indeed has been sold out by the ¡°bosses¡± ¨C economic and political. In truth, most of that selling out has been by elites favoring other elites here at home at the expense of the general populace. Foreigners are politically more convenient targets, though. Hillary Clinton speaking at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona,   by Gage Skidmore) 
The primary question is whether the disposition to blame external parties will manifest itself in antagonistic action. That has been the pattern elsewhere at other times. It is by no means obvious, though, that this logic holds in the case of the United States today. This is certainly true as regards any large-scale use of military force. 
Fifteen years of relentless, failed wars in the greater Middle East have drained the country of the passion for violence with which Americans retaliated for 9/11. Whether a President Hillary Clinton would expand operations in Syria is unaffected by the American public¡¯s anger over illegal immigration or biased ¡°trade¡± agreements. A vague distaste for ungrateful, grasping foreigners does not eclipse aversion to expensive new adventures abroad or skepticism that they will work. 
As to Russia, the current high-decibel condemnation of Moscow¡¯s alleged machinations is more an elite phenomenon, led by the security establishment, than it is an expression of popular outrage. Few Americans identify with the Syrian ¡°rebels¡± whom Vladimir Putin is fighting or Ukrainian paramilitaries burning people alive in Odessa. 
The negative view of Russia, and Putin personally, so assiduously cultivated by politicos and the mainstream media does not translate into a broad fear or hatred among the American people. The pervasive obsession with the Red Menace that marked the Cold War remains dormant. That is even true in Europe ¨C except for the Poles and the Baltics. Washington chooses to be rhetorically aggressive and to take the much publicized steps of building up NATO forces around Russia¡¯s periphery. But there is little stomach for actually raising a risk of direct conflict. 
In conclusion, American policy toward Russia and the Middle East will follow the tracks laid down by the Obama administration with little deviation ¨C and no greater success. 
The Dark Side 
Every society has its dark and dangerous undercurrents. America¡¯s is laced with racism and fed by a deep pool of personal insecurities. The recrudescence of coarse racism, the deep psychic anxieties of the white males of Middle America, the embrace of jingoism, the frustrations of trailer park super-patriots, and the desperation of tormented Evangelicals torn over the question of whether a prospective nuclear Iran is a sign that the End Days are approaching or a serious speed-bump on the road to Rapture ¨C together, these elements are creating an emotional maelstrom that has found an odd idol in the buffoonish persona of Donald Trump. Afghan children await school supplies from Allied forces at Sozo School in Kabul. (French navy photo by Master Petty Officer Valverde) 
The longer it lasts, the more attached Trump himself becomes to the pipedream of writing his name on the wind forever ¨C and the more his followers see themselves affirmed and exalted. 
Finally, we have to come to terms with the dismaying truth that public opinion, in individuals and in aggregate, is only exceptionally the outcome of an informed and thoughtful process of deliberation. It is the rationalist myth that we are by nature thinking creatures inclined to viewing the world around us in an emotionally detached, mature manner. Very, very few persons approximate that model. 
Inherited loyalties, deep-seated prejudices and preferences, private emotions, the attraction or repulsion of personality ¨C all of these elements come into play to considerable degree. In today¡¯s society where attachments of all sorts are weak and evanescent, where political parties have little cohesion, where associational life has faded, where we are exposed to the barrage of media imagery and messaging, the rationalist model has become less and less valid. Most of us are shaped by influences that we only dimly perceive ¨C whether calculated intent lies behind them or not. 
Immigration Hot Button 
Thus, it is immigration that has become the hot button issue involving other countries. Passions are aroused by two things: the presence of millions of illegals from Mexico and Central America; and the prospect of Islamic terrorists entering the United States masquerading as refugees. Syrian women and children refugees at Budapest railway station. (Photo from Wikipedia) 
The two merge at the most primitive level of emotions. Together, they deepen worries that the world is spinning out of control in ways that call into question the country the many American people know (or imagine they know). Projections of rapidly increasing Latino populations, which threaten to overwhelm school districts and voter rolls, ruffle the feathers of many Middle Americans. Alarm that welfare and other social problems are siphoning off much needed public moneys in the age of austerity add a tangible economic element to these anxieties. 
Could this lead to implementation of the sorts of draconian ¡°ethnic cleansing¡± programs advocated by Donald Trump? Unlikely ¨C despite his ability to insert them into so-called ¡°mainstream¡± discourse about the problem. It is easy to exaggerate the extent and the intensity of anti-immigrant feelings. 
Most Americans encounter little of it in their daily lives. Those who do in places like Texas or California pretty much take it as a given: something that should be dealt with but not a matter requiring urgent action. Arizona is different. That¡¯s where the extreme Rightists (and the Republican politicos whom they have intimidated into obedience) make most of the noise. 
Foreign observers should note that the situation in the U.S. is very different from that in Western Europe. Not only is the United States a very big country where relatively large populations can get lost but, equally important, social space is not as tightly configured. 
Outside of small towns, there is little sense of traditional community to be protected. Americanism trumps all as the successful integration of waves of immigrants throughout the country¡¯s history has demonstrated. While Latinos do present some unusual complications (unlike South or East Asian immigrants), visceral concerns about a denaturing of culture and society are relatively weak. (After all, 25 percent of baseball players in the professional leagues are Latinos ¨C most from abroad.) 
So, the politics of immigration policy reform has not changed. The policies and unresolved dispute over what to do next will remain in their present indeterminate state. 
The Terrorism Scare 
The immigration-terrorism link is a far more passionate matter. It taps the terrorism psychosis that has gripped the country since 9/11. The graphic outbreak of mass shootings over the past year has rekindled feverish emotions. The fact that the Orlando/San Bernadino/New York/New Jersey perpetrators had some vague connection with jihadi groups in the Middle East has given these events a transnational dimension. It doesn¡¯t seem to matter that perps were American-born citizens or had grown up in the U.S. Islamic terrorists prepare to execute a wounded policeman after their attack on the offices of French magazine Charlie Hebdo on Jan. 7, 2015. 
Logically speaking, a detached observer could infer that restrictive immigration from the Mideast or of Muslims generally would have no bearing on the level of terrorist threat. But facts in the age of Trump have lost much of their purchase on the American mind. 
One fact that is incontrovertible is that politicians run scared on all matters that are related to terrorism ¨C however oblique. The foot-dragging of President Obama on accepting any significant number of Syrian refugees is exhibit number one. Hostility toward Muslims generally is on the rise as witness the spike in abusive incidents in recent months. They now are occurring at a higher rate than they did in the wake of 9/11. By contrast, public authorities at all levels are less inclined to pursue surveillance and detention policies that skirt the law compared to that earlier period. 
The net effect will be a deepening perception around the world that the United States is hostile toward Islam. That is grist for the mill of the jihadis and opportunistic politicians. While it seems unlikely that signs of Islamo-phobia in American society will affect the thinking and actions of government leaders, they very well could register in the communities from which suicide bombers and terrorists are drawn ¨C in Europe especially and among certain unbalanced individuals in the United States itself. That cycle thereby gains velocity. 
What about the economic sphere? It is there that one might reasonably expect the preoccupations of the presidential campaign to affect the policy of a new administration. Economic nationalism follows naturally from aroused popular discontents that finger the forces of globalization as a prime cause of the economic plight in which tens of millions of American find themselves. That is to say, one might anticipate that American officials will take a more searching look at the ¡°bottom-line¡± impact of the accelerating integration of the world economy whose promotion has been a centerpiece of American foreign policy since the early 1990s ¨C as actively and optimistically promoted by Hillary Clinton¡¯s husband. 
The process has tremendous momentum ¨C institutional (via such entities as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank), political and intellectual. Economic thinking, academic and governmental, has been totally dominated by the twin market fundamentalist concepts of General Market Equilibrium Theory and benign globalization. 
A Bow to Inequality 
While it has become trendy for all and sundry to make a ceremonial bow to the inequality phenomenon, it is hard to see the momentum of this juggernaut being blocked by disorganized displays of populism. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. 
Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who served under President Bill Clinton, personifies this state of affairs. One of the architects and master builders of the financialized, unregulated transnational economy who fought ruthlessly to bail out Wall Street at the expense of Main Street after the 2008 crash, he now punctuates his innumerable public appearances with warnings that we should pay attention to the inequality dilemma. 
This homily is not a prelude to any action. Rather, it is akin to the Mafia don who devoutly crosses himself every time that his limousine crosses the path of a religious procession on a Saint¡¯s Day. 
That is the outlook in the United States under Hillary Clinton. The one exception might by the TPP and TIIP trade treaties with Asia. Both were crafted by elites imbued by the optimistic globalization creed, both were kept secret except for the financial and commercial interests who were participants in their drafting, and both go far beyond traditional trade matters. 
The former, in particular, represents a radical transference of power from national governments to private parties institutionalized in expert panels heavily biased toward the latter. Indeed, many of its provisions may be unconstitutional ¨C as a fair-minded Supreme Court could rule. 
That recondite aspect of TPP did not get an airing during the campaign. However, the tying of the treaty to the damaging effects of ¡°trade¡± treaties forced even its supporters to equivocate. Hillary Clinton had been an enthusiastic backer until Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump began to reap political hay by condemning it. She now declares that is acceptable only if significant new conditions are met. 
What will be her ultimate position? She may be spared that agonizing decision were Obama able to push a lame-duck session of the Senate to ratify it. Otherwise, it may just be the one and only piece of American foreign relations that changes as a result of the election campaign. 
Continuity is likely to prevail elsewhere. Americans overall will remain the insular, parochial, moralizing and largely ignorant citizens they have been. That leaves plenty of space for a foreign-policy establishment driven by a powerful inertia to add to its long string of mishaps.

By Andrew Spannaus 
This year¡¯s presidential election has been surprising on many fronts, with the success of a number of outsider candidates and the fact that the most unorthodox of them all, Donald Trump, is within striking distance of victory in the last days of the campaign. 
As shocking as Trump¡¯s candidacy has been to the national media and political establishment, it has provoked even more astonishment outside of the United States, where people often have a superficial view of the U.S. political and economic situation. This is driven by a reliance on only a few major news outlets that tend to give an elitist view of what happens in the country, ignoring the type of undercurrents that have driven the outsider campaigns this year. Donald Trump speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at Veterans Memorial Coliseum at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix, Arizona. June 18, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) 
In Europe, a common question asked of Americans this year has been: ¡°Has everyone gone crazy?¡± 
There is shock that much of the country would be willing to vote for someone as unprepared and offensive as Donald Trump. It is heightened by the fact that the current President is the first African-American to hold the office, confusing people who thought that Barack Obama¡¯s election had put racial considerations on the backburner, but now see the Republican candidate drawing on racist stereotypes to increase enthusiasm among his base. 
This has led to the common view that white, male America is ¡°fighting back,¡± and not willing to accept a woman president, after having to suffer the indignity of the first black president for the past eight years. 
While sexism and racism can¡¯t be ignored, the problem is that just as much of the U.S. media has done for so long, Europeans concentrate mostly on the person of Trump himself, with his countless faults, while almost entirely ignoring the discontent among the population that has made this kind of revolt possible. 
There is in fact very little recognition of the difficulties of the U.S. middle class over the past 35 years, caused principally by the pro-finance, anti-industrial policies that have contributed to the loss of millions of well-paying jobs across the country. The media touts the low unemployment numbers and the return to economic growth, and thus Europeans don¡¯t understand how the American population could be so upset, and what the source of the anger could be. 
Yet it doesn¡¯t take much to go beneath the surface and explain the economic anxiety that has driven the realignment of U.S. politics this year. Indeed the stagnation of wages and lack of financial security that much of the American middle- and lower-class suffers from is quite similar to that in Europe; and in Europe the drop in living standards is leading to a continent-wide revolt against the institutions of the European Union.   Europe¡¯s Battle: Nationalists vs. Elites .¡±] 
A Left-Right Resistance 
In Europe as in the U.S., there are right-wing and left-wing manifestations of the protest, combining anger against the bank bailouts, opposition to economic austerity, and fear of immigrants seen as threatening traditions and security. Flag of the European Union. 
In addition, international ¡°free trade¡± agreements are the target of significant public and political opposition around the Continent, even more so than in the U.S., where much of the establishment remains committed to the current neoliberal economic policies. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the self-described ¡°democratic socialist,¡± and real-estate mogul Donald Trump both target NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, denouncing the pacts as negative for American workers and favorable mostly to multinational corporations. In Europe the target is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the agreement still being negotiated with the U.S. that is seen as negative for smaller companies and traditional markets, and favorable mostly to multinational corporations. 
The similarities between the protest movements are so strong that failure to recognize them means that someone obviously deserves a prize for misinformation. 
When it comes to foreign policy, the issues become even more urgent for Europe. While Donald Trump promises to crush ISIS and increase spending on the U.S. military, his position regarding the key strategic question for Europe ¨C relations with Russia ¨C is the opposite of what most people expect. 
Hillary Clinton¡¯s hawkish stance towards Russia and her stated disgust for Vladimir Putin appear to be perfectly in tune with the reversion towards an adversarial relationship that is currently taking shape after the apparent failure of attempts at greater cooperation through diplomacy made by President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry listens to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a meeting room at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, at the outset of a bilateral meeting on July 14, 2016. [State Department Photo] The superficial view is that Clinton will represent continuity with the foreign policy of the Obama administration, but anyone who has been paying attention knows that on numerous important questions, from the nuclear agreement with Iran to relations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, from the establishment of a ¡°no-fly zone¡± in Syria to intervening more directly in Ukraine, there is significant daylight between the President and his former Secretary of State, and Clinton has barely attempted to hide it.
Trump, on the other hand, is more in line with the preferred foreign policy of most major European nations, in particular as regards Russia. After years of sanctions and increased military activities closer to Russia¡¯s borders, the leaders of Germany, France and Italy all hope for a reduction of tensions, allowing them to resume economic relations and avoid being caught in the middle of a new East-West conflict. 
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has been particularly vocal in opposing the anti-Russia sanctions, including ¨C curiously ¨C immediately after his return from a state dinner at the White House. In fact, it¡¯s not the first time he has been critical of current policy towards Russia right after a meeting in Washington, and as anyone in Italy knows, it¡¯s highly unlikely he would make such statements without tacit approval, or at least acceptance, from the U.S. government, in this case most likely President Obama. 
If Hillary Clinton wins the election, it will be interesting to see if nations such as Italy will continue to be afforded such leeway. 
Over the course of the campaign, the recognition of the deeper issues at play in the U.S. election has grown, although such discussion still tends to be overshadowed by superficial coverage of the personal battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and the various scandals of the moment. 
Europeans would do better to pay close attention to the fundamental questions that have been raised during the campaign, that will have a major impact on the entire Western world in the coming years: the fate of the middle class and the decline of the productive economy, and the decision as to whether to seek cooperation, or conflict, with Russia.

Donald Trump¡¯s campaign has exposed and spoken to the real pain and profound alienation of many Americans, but the candidate also has exploited those emotions with lies and appeals to prejudice, says Michael Winship. 
By Michael Winship 
When I grow up, I want to be Charlie Pierce , who covers politics for Esquire magazine and has toiled in our scrivener¡¯s trade, as far as I can tell, since the late 1970s. 
I know, technically, he¡¯s a couple of years younger than I am, but he writes with the fierce wit and well-aimed anger to which I aspire, and as this wheezing milk train of a presidential campaign clanks into the final station, few have been as perceptive when it comes to trying to figure out just what the hell has happened to America this year. Donald Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention. (Photo credit: Grant Miller/RNC) 
Charlie Pierce has done so with great style throughout, but now, thanks to Donald Trump and just hours before Election Day, he has come to the end of his watchdog rope. He wrote on Saturday that Trump ¡ª to whom he refers as El Caudillo del Mar-A-Lago ¡ª had ¡°managed to exceed even my admittedly expansive limits for political obscenity.¡± 
Pierce was talking about Trump¡¯s reaction after President Obama responded to an elderly heckler wearing a military tunic at a Friday campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina. 
As the crowd booed the man, Obama said, ¡°Hey! Listen up! I told you to be focused, and you¡¯re not focused right now. Listen to what I¡¯m saying. Hold up. Hold up! ¡­ Everybody sit down, and be quiet for a second¡­ First of all, we live in a country that respects free speech. Second of all, it looks like maybe he might¡¯ve served in our military and we got to respect that. Third of all, he was elderly and we got to respect our elders. And fourth of all, don¡¯t boo, vote.¡± 
In other words, the President showed poise, grace and yes, class. But shortly after, here¡¯s how the moment was seen through Trump¡¯s eyes at a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania: ¡°There was a protester and a protester that likes us,¡± Trump said. ¡°And what happened is they wouldn¡¯t put the cameras on him. They kept the cameras on Obama. ¡­ He was talking to a protester, screaming at him, really screaming at him. By the way, if I spoke the way Obama spoke to that protester, they would say he became unhinged.¡± 
Unhinged? Really? We all know that Trump seems to get his news from an implanted electrode picking up propaganda signals from the Planet Mongo. But there comes a point when the lies piled upon lies become too much for even the fairest and most equable of us. Hearing Trump¡¯s demonstrably false description of what happened at Obama¡¯s rally, Charlie Pierce finally had it. 
¡°Maybe it was because it was so ludicrously provable a lie,¡± he wrote. ¡°[Trump] didn¡¯t care. He never has cared. His contempt for the democratic processes and for the norms of self-government is matched only by the deep contempt he has for all the suckers who mistake his contempt for the American experiment for their deep disappointment in it. He has measured their intelligence by his heavily leveraged net worth and found them hilariously lacking. 
¡°We are all the subcontractors who build his indomitable ego for him and, as such, he can stiff us according to his customary business plan. His campaign long ago became a sickening charade performed by a grotesque charlatan.¡± 
The Scene in Reno 
And so it is. Look, too, at how Trump and his followers at a rally in Reno, Nevada, on Saturday responded to a man with a ¡°Republicans against Trump¡± sign. Before someone shouted ¡°Gun!¡± and the moment turned even uglier, Trump had looked down and said, ¡°Oh we have one of those guys from the Hillary Clinton campaign. How much are you being paid, $1,500?¡± As the crowd booed, Trump said, ¡°Okay. Take him out.¡± The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads ¡°Vote Trump¡± on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr) 
The protester, a Reno resident named Austyn Crites, described himself as Republican and a fiscal conservative. He told The Guardian he was grateful to the police who removed him from the auditorium for interrogation ¡ª they kept him from being further kicked, choked and pummeled by the gang of Trump supporters who surrounded him. 
Still, he said, ¡°The people who attacked me ¡ª I¡¯m not blaming them. I¡¯m blaming Donald Trump¡¯s hate rhetoric, ¡­ The fact that I got beat up today, that¡¯s just showing what he¡¯s doing to his crowds.¡± 
Throughout the campaign, whenever Trump has egged on his followers, I¡¯ve thought of that line in Young Frankenstein, when the angry Transylvanian villagers are told by the local police inspector, ¡°A riot is an ugly thing, and I think that it is just about time we had one.¡± 
Remember what Trump said when a protester was dragged out of a February rally in Las Vegas: ¡°I love the old days ¡ª you know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They¡¯d be carried out on a stretcher, folks. ¡­ I¡¯d like to punch him in the face.¡± 
By now, you¡¯ve heard it all before and the litany of lies, outrageous claims and insults has climbed so high that many of us have become numb and weary from the sheer repetition of Trump¡¯s buffoonery. You can only go to so many demolition derbies before the sight of flaming car wrecks becomes routine. 
Dog Whistles 
What¡¯s more, you can argue that far more insidious and frightening are the dog whistle attacks appealing to the baser instincts of the bigoted and ignorant. The latest: the closing ad from the Trump campaign that, with anti-Semitic overtones, points fingers at ¡°a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class.¡± Former   speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. March 21, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) 
As Josh Marshall notes at Talking Points Memo , ¡°The four readily identifiable American bad guys in the ad are Hillary Clinton, George Soros (Jewish financier), Janet Yellen (Jewish Fed Chair) and Lloyd Blankfein (Jewish Goldman Sachs CEO)¡­ This is an ad intended to appeal to anti-Semites and spread anti-Semitic ideas¡­ This is intentional and by design. It is no accident.¡± 
Here is something Charlie Pierce wrote back in May . Trump, he said, ¡°is riding on a wave of pain that he never has felt.¡± 
¡°He is riding on a wave of anxiety he never has encountered. Beyond their love of him, there is no indication that he is as deeply aware of what has powered his rise as the people whose fear, and doubt, and, yes, hatred has powered his rise. Their job is still to wait in line, cheer on cue, and give him the devotion that he has earned because, after all, he is He, Trump, and they¡¯re not, and that will never change.¡± 
Add it all up and to me, this is what it comes down to: Do you want to live in a United States where anger, prejudice and fear rule, and dissent is viewed as treason, or in a country where we try to meet every issue from terrorism to education with clear eyes and a rational mind? 
This year¡¯s choices are far from perfect, but nonetheless a choice must be made. To quote a founding father who believed in such things: liberty, once lost, is lost forever. This could be democracy¡¯s last stop. Vote.

Exclusive: Hillary Clinton¡¯s stunning defeat reflected a gross misjudgment by the Democratic Party about the depth of populist anger against self-serving elites who have treated much of the country with disdain, writes Robert Parry. 
By Robert Parry 
In the end, Hillary Clinton became the face of a corrupt, arrogant and out-of-touch Establishment, while Donald Trump emerged as an almost perfectly imperfect vessel for a populist fury that had bubbled beneath the surface of America. 
There is clearly much to fear from a Trump presidency, especially coupled with continued Republican control of Congress. Trump and many Republicans have denied the reality of climate change; they favor more tax cuts for the rich; they want to deregulate Wall Street and other powerful industries ¨C all policies that helped create the current mess that the United States and much of the world are now in. A sign supporting Donald Trump at a rally at Veterans Memorial Coliseum at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix, Arizona. June 18, 2016 (Photo by Gage Skidmore) 
Further, Trump¡¯s personality is problematic to say the least. He lacks the knowledge and the temperament that one would like to see in a President ¨C or even in a much less powerful public official. He appealed to racism, misogyny, white supremacy, bigotry toward immigrants and prejudice toward Muslims. He favors torture and wants a giant wall built across America¡¯s southern border. 
But American voters chose him in part because they felt they needed a blunt instrument to smash the Establishment that has ruled and mis-ruled America for at least the past several decades. It is an Establishment that not only has grabbed for itself almost all the new wealth that the country has produced but has casually sent the U.S. military into wars of choice, as if the lives of working-class soldiers are of little value. 
On foreign policy, the Establishment had turned decision-making over to the neoconservatives and their liberal-interventionist sidekicks, a collection of haughty elitists who often subordinated American interests to those of Israel and Saudi Arabia, for political or financial advantage. 
The war choices of the neocon/liberal-hawk coalition have been disastrous ¨C from Iraq to Afghanistan to Libya to Syria to Ukraine ¨C yet this collection of know-it-alls never experiences accountability. The same people, including the media¡¯s armchair warriors and the think-tank ¡°scholars,¡± bounce from one catastrophe to the next with no consequences for their fallacious ¡°group thinks.¡± Most recently, they have ginned up a new costly and dangerous Cold War with Russia. 
For all his faults, Trump was one of the few major public figures who dared challenge the ¡°group thinks¡± on the current hot spots of Syria and Russia. In response, Clinton and many Democrats chose to engage in a crude McCarthyism with Clinton even baiting Trump as Vladimir Putin¡¯s ¡°puppet¡± during the final presidential debate. 
It is somewhat remarkable that those tactics failed; that Trump talked about cooperation with Russia, rather than confrontation, and won. Trump¡¯s victory could mean that rather than escalating the New Cold War with Russia, there is the possibility of a ratcheting down of tensions. 
Repudiating the Neocons 
Thus, Trump¡¯s victory marks a repudiation of the neocon/liberal-hawk orthodoxy because the New Cold War was largely incubated in neocon/liberal-hawk think tanks, brought to life by likeminded officials in the U.S. State Department, and nourished by propaganda across the mainstream Western media. Donald Trump speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. June 18, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) 
It was the West, not Russia, that provoked the confrontation over Ukraine by helping to install a fiercely anti-Russian regime on Russia¡¯s borders. I know the mainstream Western media framed the story as ¡°Russian aggression¡± but that was always a gross distortion. 
There were peaceful ways for settling the internal differences inside Ukraine without violating the democratic process, but U.S. neocons, such as Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, and wealthy neoliberals, such as financial speculator George Soros, pushed for a putsch that overthrew the elected President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. 
Putin¡¯s response, including his acceptance of Crimea¡¯s overwhelming referendum to return to Russia and his support for ethnic Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine opposing the coup regime in Kiev, was a reaction to the West¡¯s destabilizing and violent actions. Putin was not the instigator of the troubles. 
Similarly, in Syria, the West¡¯s ¡°regime change¡± strategy, which dates back to neocon planning in the mid-1990s, involved collaboration with Al Qaeda and other Islamic jihadists to remove the secular government of Bashar al-Assad. Again, Official Washington and the mainstream media portrayed the conflict as all Assad¡¯s fault, but that wasn¡¯t the full picture. 
From the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, U.S. ¡°allies,¡± including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Israel, have been aiding the rebellion, with Turkey and the Gulf states funneling money and weapons to Al Qaeda¡¯s Nusra Front and even to the Al Qaeda spinoff, Islamic State. 
Though President Barack Obama dragged his heels on the direct intervention advocated by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama eventually went in halfway, bending to political pressure by agreeing to train and arm so-called ¡°moderates¡± who ended up fighting next to Al Qaeda¡¯s Nusra Front and other jihadists in Ahrar al-Sham. 
Trump has been inarticulate and imprecise in describing what policies he would follow in Syria, besides suggesting that he would cooperate with the Russians in destroying Islamic State. But Trump didn¡¯t seem to understand the role of Al Qaeda in controlling east Aleppo and other Syrian territory. 
Uncharted Territory 
So, the American voters have plunged the United States and the world into uncharted territory behind a President-elect who lacks a depth of knowledge on a wide variety of issues. Who will guide a President Trump becomes the most pressing issue today. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. March 21, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) 
Will he rely on traditional Republicans who have done so much to mess up the country and the world or will he find some fresh-thinking realists who will realign policy with core American interests and values. 
For this dangerous and uncertain moment, the Democratic Party establishment deserves a large share of the blame. Despite signs that 2016 would be a year for an anti-Establishment candidate ¨C possibly someone like Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders ¨C the Democratic leadership decided that it was ¡°Hillary¡¯s turn.¡± 
Alternatives like Warren were discouraged from running so there could be a Clinton ¡°coronation.¡± That left the 74-year-old socialist from Vermont as the only obstacle to Clinton¡¯s nomination and it turned out that Sanders was a formidable challenger. But his candidacy was ultimately blocked by Democratic insiders, including the unelected ¡°super-delegates¡± who gave Clinton an early and seemingly insurmountable lead. 
With blinders firmly in place, the Democrats yoked themselves to Clinton¡¯s gilded carriage and tried to pull it all the way to the White House. But they ignored the fact that many Americans came to see Clinton as the personification of all that is wrong about the insular and corrupt world of Official Washington. And that has given us President-elect Trump.

For many Americans, the idea of a Trump presidency and a Republican-controlled Congress is frightening, with the prospect of right-wing legislation and judicial appointments sailing through, but quitting is not an option, says Norman Solomon. 
By Norman Solomon 
A lot of U.S citizens are now talking about leaving the country. Canada, Europe and New Zealand are popular scenarios. Moving abroad might be an individual solution. But the social solution is to stay and put up a fight. 
The most right-wing U.S. government in our lifetimes will soon have its executive and legislative branches under reactionary control, with major ripple effects on the judiciary. All the fixings for a dystopian future will be on the table. President-elect Donald Trump 
In a realistic light, the outlook is awfully grim. No wonder a huge number of people in the United States are struggling with mixtures of grief, anger, frustration, fear. 
If Donald Trump and major forces backing him get their way, the conditions described by Frederick Douglass ¡ª still all too prevalent now ¡ª will worsen in the years ahead: ¡°Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob, and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.¡± 
As James Baldwin wrote, ¡°People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction, and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster.¡± 
Those quotes from Douglass and Baldwin are in a book of paintings by Robert Shetterly, Americans Who Tell the Truth . Another portrait in the collection appears under these words from Helen Keller: ¡°When one comes to think of it, there are no such things as divine, immutable, or inalienable rights. Rights are things we get when we are strong enough to make good our claim on them.¡± 
That statement from Keller aptly describes our current predicament and possibilities. The impending Trump presidency is a direct threat to basic human rights. To make good our claim on those rights will require that we become ¡°strong enough,¡± individually and collectively. 
Gaining such strength will require that we provide much more support for independent progressive institutions ¡ª the array of organizations that can serve as collective bulwarks against the momentum of systemic greed, bigotry, massive violence, economic exploitation and environmental destruction. 
We¡¯re now being flung into a new era that will intensify many of the oppressive aspects of the U.S. governmental apparatus and political economy. An ongoing imperative will be to mitigate serious-to-catastrophic damage in many realms. We need a united front ¡ª against the very real threat of severe repression that could morph into some form of fascism. 
At this highly precarious time, progressives certainly don¡¯t need the tempests of factional disputes and ideological battles. And we certainly don¡¯t need the kind of reflexive capitulation that so often comes from the upper reaches of the Democratic Party. We¡¯re at the start of a protracted crisis that could become cataclysmic. We need progressive unity and unrelenting determination. 
Only with eyes wide open do we have a real chance to understand clearly and organize effectively against the Trump regime. Failure to put up a fight should be unthinkable.

Exclusive: Team Clinton thought the path to the White House led through a neo-McCarthyistic assault on Donald Trump as Vladimir Putin¡¯s puppet, rather than addressing the real worries of Americans, writes James W Carden. 
By James W Carden 
Watching the returns come in on the morning of Nov. 9, my mind turned immediately to the question of blame. How could it be that someone so manifestly unqualified for the White House managed to beat a candidate who was widely acknowledged to be the most highly qualified person ever to have run for the nation¡¯s highest office? 
For answers, look no further than the hierarchy of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee under Debbie Wasserman Shultz, and, later, longtime Democratic operative and talking head Donna Brazile. Donald Trump speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. June 18, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) 

First, as Wikileaks has proven without a shadow of a doubt, it is clear that the DNC colluded with the Clinton campaign as well as with highly placed sources at CNN to fatally undermine and sabotage the progressive insurgency campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. 
Throughout the primary, the Clintons and their vast network of high-profile surrogates in the media sought to undercut Sanders by painting his supporters as not only completely unrealistic in their expectations for what government can and should do, but as a group of bullying misogynists as well. 
Once they managed to push Sanders out of the way, they launched a general election campaign that was stunning in both its incompetence and its cynicism. That the campaign was badly run can hardly come as a surprise, staffed as it was by a young, startlingly vapid campaign manager by name of Robby Mook. 
Policy was handled by the equally young and wondrously overrated former head of the policy planning staff at the U.S. State Department, Jake Sullivan. On the evidence of its policy papers and press releases, the campaign, which relied on such ¡°outsiders¡± as Center for American Progress president Neera Tanden, clearly decided that once Sanders was defeated, they had no lessons to learn from his candidacy. 
Ignoring America¡¯s Needs 
They failed to recognize that despite the laughably inaccurate Labor Department unemployment statistics, which claim the U.S. unemployment rate is just under 5 percent, millions upon millions of Americans are without work, and are increasingly without hope. 
A country which ranks right along side Albania and Bosnia in incidents of infant morality; a country which has a Gini coefficient (a measure of income inequality) on par with Cameroon; a country with nearly 25 million of its citizens addicted to drugs and alcohol; a country that has a crumbling infrastructure and bad schools is a country whose government has repeatedly failed them. The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads ¡°Vote Trump¡± on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr) 
Hillary Clinton, a former First Lady, U.S. Senator, and Secretary of State is, as Donald Trump rightly surmised, widely seen as the face of that government, as the face of those failures. 
But instead of addressing the well-founded angst among large swathes of the population, Clinton and her team decided the path to victory would open up not by addressing Trump¡¯s substantive critique of the American economy or his entirely appropriate (though never too well thought-out) questioning of the American imperium. No: Team Clinton, Mook, Sullivan, Podesta and Tanden had a better idea. Let us tie the albatross of Russian president Vladimir Putin around the neck of the gloriously unqualified billionaire candidate. 
That, according to Team Clinton, was just the ticket. And so, as I pointed out in the pages of ConsortiumNews as the campaign was ending, the Clinton¡¯s pursued a policy of Red-baiting with abandon. During each debate, at any of Trump¡¯s mentions of Russia, the Clinton campaign apparatus would kick into high gear and release a flurry of press releases designed to cast doubt not only on Trump¡¯s character but on his patriotism. 
Unfounded and undocumented accusations of the Trump campaign¡¯s illusory connection to the Kremlin were repeated ad nauseam by prominent voices of the liberal intelligentsia like MSNBC¡¯s Joy Reid, New York Magazine¡¯s Jon Chait, New America Fellow Franklin Foer, Mother Jones editor David Corn, among many others. 
Their efforts failed in spectacular fashion in the early morning hours of Nov. 9. The electorate at long last has risen up against the suffocating, foolish and impoverishing neoliberal consensus, which has held sway in Washington for the past 25 years. The rush to normalize trade relations with China, the unbelievably damaging free trade agreements with Mexico, the vast governmental subsidization of Wall Street have ruined and, yes, ended more lives than the many wars this country has been unnecessarily been waging for the past 15 years. 
As the University of Michigan¡¯s Juan Cole recently pointed out: ¡°A year ago Anne Case and Angus Deaton, Princeton University economists, published a study with the startling finding that since 1999 death rates have been going up for white Americans aged 45-54. It is even worse than it sounds, since death rates were declining for the general population.¡± 
In other words, neoliberalism at home and neoconservatism abroad are killing Americans (as well as people in countries where the U.S. government has imposed ¡°regime change¡± solutions). Yet instead of addressing the long, slow and sad decline of the U.S. in the quarter century following the end of the first Cold War, Clinton, Podesta, Mook and Sullivan decided that the correct course of action would be to dream up a fictitious Manchurian candidate scenario in order to defeat Trump, a candidate who, for all of his obvious faults, at least spoke to the problems of ordinary people. 
In short: The Clintons and their friends and enablers in the Democratic Party and in the media have only themselves to blame for President-elect Donald J. Trump.

Cultural Resistance 
The second aspect to the present discontent has been cultural oppression (or, in the rhetoric of the Democratic Party, ¡°identity politics¡± ¨C one of the mainstays of the Clintonite electoral base). Its roots are complex, and lie with philosophic currents emerging out of Germany during WWII that somehow fused with American Trotskyist intellectual thinking (which then migrated to the Right). But, in gist, this current of political thought borrowed from the emerging discipline of psychology the concept of clearing the human mind ¨C shocking it, or forcing it into becoming the ¡°clean slate¡± on which a new mental program could be written by the psychiatric (or political) therapist respectively. 
The political aim here was to eliminate totalitarian thinking, and fascist mental ¡°programming,¡± and to replace it with a liberal-democracy circuit board. 
Indeed, the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was promoted by this intellectual group precisely in furtherance of the notion that concepts such as ¡°national culture¡± would become meaningless as a result of immigrant cultural dilution. By the 1970s and 1980s , the objective had evolved to implant the idea that there was really no politics to modernity (Fukuyama¡¯s End of History ) since all governance somehow had boiled down to technocracy: ensuring effective liberal market functioning ¡ª a matter best left to experts. 
In political terms, the ¡°clearing¡± of the mind¡¯s inherited cultural clutter was to be achieved by cultural wars of political correctness. The class war had become discredited, but there were other ¡°victims¡± on whose behalf war could be waged: the war on gender discrimination, on racism, on denial of gay rights and sexual orientation stereotyping, on verbal micro-aggressions, on sexist language, or any ideas or language which disturbed the individual¡¯s sense of ¡°safe space¡± were used as tools to clear away old cultural ¡°brush¡± of inherited national culture, and open the way for an American-led, globalized world. 
The ostensible factor linking all these notions of victim ¡°wars¡± was that their antonym amounted either to fascism or authoritarianism. The problem with this has been that any white American blue-collar worker who attended church, who believed in family life, and was patriotic, became potentially a fascist, a racist, a sexist or a bigot. 
Many ordinary Americans (and Europeans) disdain this ¡°cultural¡± war which places him or her ( according to Hillary Clinton), in the ¡°¡®basket of deplorables¡¯ Right? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic, you name it,¡± and who looked upon his or her community as representing nothing more than a ¡°fly-over¡± state in the view of the U.S. coastal ¨¦lites. 
The deplorables have now risen up. Donald Trump¡¯s salty language was no liability ¨C it was an electoral asset by thumbing his nose at this correctness, and at so-called ¡±snowflake¡± sensibilities . Trump¡¯s ¡®incorrectness¡¯ touched on a deep vein of resentment within American traditional society. 
Not only does ¡°flyover America¡± resent being termed ¡°deplorables,¡± they feel too clearly the disdain in which the American and European elites hold them ¨C and dislike their arrogance in suggesting that there is only one rational, sensible way of doing things, and that they ¨C the elites, being the experts and a part of the Davos set ¨C should tell the rest of us what it is: (despite their decades of failures). 
High Emotions 
Emotions are high on both sides. To gain a sense of how bitterly the cultural war will be fought, listen to this from the partly-Soros-funded populist mobilization movement Azaaz (linked to America¡¯s Move On organization): ¡°Dear Mr. Trump: This is not what greatness looks like. The world rejects your fear, hate-mongering, and bigotry. We reject your support for torture, your calls for murdering civilians, and your general encouragement of violence. We reject your denigration of women, Muslims, Mexicans, and millions of others who don¡¯t look like you, talk like you, or pray to the same god as you. Facing your fear we choose compassion. Hearing your despair we choose hope. Seeing your ignorance we choose understanding. As citizens of the world, we stand united against your brand of division.¡± Billionaire currency speculator George Soros. (Photo credit: georgesoros.com) 
In short, with Brexit and the Trump victory, we are witnessing an historic point of inflexion. As I noted in mid-October (quoting British political philosopher John Gray): ¡°If the tension between [the globalization project on one hand] and the [sovereign] nation state, [on the other] was one of the contradictions of Thatcherism ¡­ From Bill Clinton and Tony Blair onwards, the center-left embraced the project of a global free market with an enthusiasm as ardent as any on the right. If globalization was at odds with social cohesion, society had to be re-engineered to become an adjunct of the market. The result was that large sections of the population were left to moulder in stagnation or poverty, some without any prospect of finding a productive place in society.¡± 
¡°If Gray is correct that when globalized economics strikes trouble, people will demand that the state must pay attention to their own parochial, national economic situation (and not to the utopian concerns of the centralizing elite), it suggests that just as globalization is over ¨C so too is centralization (in all its many manifestations).¡± 
Well, the global trend does not seem to be going in the Avaaz direction. It seems rather to be heading toward prioritizing the recovery of the state, of state sovereignty, and of state engagement in the pursuit of economic policies appropriate to the particular circumstances of the state, and in the state¡¯s ultimate responsibility for the welfare of the community as a whole. 
The question is what does this mean geo-strategically? And, secondly, can and will, Trump be able to deliver the new era? The short answer is that this new era seems to presage a period of political volatility, financial volatility and in Europe and the Middle East, the prospect of continued political ¡°shock.¡± 
It is clear that Mr. Trump is not a globalist. It is also clear that he is aware of some of the dangers of the present global monetarist policy. He has spoken of the U.S. Federal Reserve creating ¡°big ugly bubbles¡± and that the next economic and financial crisis has been ¡°kicked down the road¡± by Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen ¨C and clearly awaits whomsoever becomes U.S. President on Jan. 20, 2017. 
Painted into a Corner 
But three decades of debt-led, financialized ¡°growth policies¡± leave the President-elect effectively painted into a corner: global debt has spiraled; the bubbles are there still (kept afloat by Central Bank coordinated intervention), and bubbles are infamously difficult to deflate gently; zero or negative interest rates are undermining many a business model, but cannot easily be foregone, without crashing the bond market; and QE (printing money) is systematically eating away at consumer purchasing power through the dilution of its newly created purchasing power, and the latter¡¯s re-direction from ¡°main street¡± into the financial sector ¨C lifting nominal asset values ¨C but creating no tangible wealth. China¡¯s President Xi Jinping. 
America and Europe effectively are in debt-deflation. How then to grow incomes so that producers of goods and services can also afford then subsequently to purchase these goods and services? Trump¡¯s answer is to spend on domestic infrastructure projects. This may help a bit, but is unlikely ¨C in itself ¨C to lift and float the entire U.S. economy. 
The reality is that there is no obvious global engine of growth (now that China¡¯s ¡°industrial revolution¡± has stalled at best). Every nation now is in search of new engines of growth. And it is not easy to imagine that Europe or America will succeed in retrieving all those jobs lost through globalization. Indeed, the attempt so to do ¨C in, and of itself ¨C might just precipitate a further deceleration of world trade, and a consequent decline in output. 
In brief, the global economy may see a brief ¡°honeymoon period¡± thanks to a likely spurt of U.S. fiscal indulgence and a concomitant psychological lift, stemming from ¨C at least ¨C the U.S. construction sector enjoying something of a boom. But ultimately the very economic crisis which Mr. Trump anticipates may prove to be the only way to cut the Gordian knot in which three decades of unprecedented debt and money printing have fettered us. 
And if he is to steer through the expected crisis, Mr. Trump will have to eschew the Siren voices of the present elites telling him ¡°TINA¡± (there is no alternative, but to continue as before). 
Where Mr Trump might look for an early (and relatively easy) success however, may be in foreign policy. As ¡°Nixon went to China,¡± so Trump can go to Russia and China, and begin to treat them as normal nations with whom it is possible to find an intersection of interests (as well as areas of disagreement). 
This would be revolutionary. It could change the geo-strategical map. And as President Putin keeps repeating ¡­ the door is open (at least for now). Nothing is forever in politics.

Donald Trump¡¯s victory may have shaken up the System but it also revealed a recklessness (or a desperation) among Americans in handing over such immense power to someone so untested, says Michael Brenner. 
By Michael Brenner 
At this moment of unprecedented upheaval, it is striking that some things never change. We are being subject to a tidal wave of interpretation and speculation as to what a Trump administration means for American foreign relations in regard to inter alia Russia, Syria, the Iran nuclear deal, the ¡°pivot to Asia,¡± trans-Atlantic ties and, of course, Mexico. 
It is entirely natural for a distraught political elite to wonder what comes next from this unstable, quixotic showman who soon will be sitting in the White House. It is neither natural nor appropriate, though, to make believe that Washington in experiencing a transition of power to be approached in standard terms. The unpalatable truth is that we have no idea as to what Trump will do or not do. President-elect Donald Trump. 
Trump¡¯s campaign remarks are the sole evidence available for indications of the direction that he will take. That is an extremely flimsy a basis for forecasting actions abroad. For two reasons. Candidates¡¯ calculated sound bites while running almost never are a reliable guide to their thinking ¨C in its rudimentary form or as it takes shape under the influence of real life conditions and the counsel of advisers. 
Consider Barack Obama, a far more thoughtful, sober and intelligent man. Remember the objective of eliminating nuclear weapons (rather than committing $1 trillion to the development of a more ¡°usable¡± arsenal). Remember closing Guantanamo and reining in electronic surveillance of Americans. Remember ending the engagement of American troops in the ¡°GWOT¡± (we now are fighting in 38 places by one means or another). 
Remember ¡°resetting¡± relations with Vladimir Putin¡¯s Russia to emphasize dialogue. Remember the stated goal of normalizing relations with the Mullahs in Teheran instead of treating them as inherently hostile to America. Remember promoting democracy as the long-term cure to what ails the Middle East (instead, backing full tilt the Gulf autocracies, including Saudi Arabia¡¯s homicidal war on the Yemeni people; Sisi¡¯s oppressive autocracy in Egypt; and Israel¡¯s increasing brutalization of the Palestinians). 
Points of Demagoguery 
Second, Trump¡¯s comments about foreign policy were mere points of demagoguery meant, as with everything else he said, to appeal to the primitive instincts of an aroused audience. There is not the slightest sign that he had thought seriously about any of it. Donald Trump finds serious thinking itself an alien mental activity. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, one of the few Senate Republicans to support Donald Trump, donning one of Trump¡¯s ¡°Make America Great Again¡± caps. 
Moreover, he has few experienced advisers in his entourage. Apart from some conversations with retired General Michael Flynn, the off-beat former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the chairman of his national security advisory panel, James Woolsey, former Director of the CIA, his ¡°advisers¡± have been a collection of odd-balls, non-entities and dogmatists. Woolsey himself is an uber-hawk whose views on all matters of consequence align with those of the neocons, the Cheney-like hard nationalists and Hillary Clinton ¨C and are diametrically opposite to Trump¡¯s much publicized iconoclastic remarks. 
So what we will be seeing between now and the Inauguration, and afterwards, is a mad rush by a horde of aspirants for the power and access to occupy Donald Trump¡¯s mind ¨C if they can find it. 
This is the brutal reality. Since it provides little of substance for the habitual commentators, they are inclined to play a game of make-believe ¨C conjuring supposedly meaningful evidence from what is a kaleidoscope of emotional outbursts and a fantasia of day dreams. 
There is good reason to believe that within six months of Trump¡¯s taking office, when his administrations undertakes its first half-baked measures abroad, the think tank crowd will be writing articles and monographs on ¡°The Trump Doctrine.¡± 
In other words, the same mentality that helped get us into this mess. Americans have become committed to a new categorical imperative: I sound off, therefore I am. 
If Truth be told, the America we have known and imagined is ended. It never will return. In terms of relations with others, image is of enormous importance. The United States has gained great advantage from being seen as exceptional. From its earliest days, it fascinated and gave inspiration as the first working democracy, as the embodiment of the hope-filled New World, as the land of the common man and common decency. 
Later, as it grew into a world power, it held the allure for many as being somehow beyond the world¡¯s pervasive tawdriness. These images held even as contradicted by slavery and racism, by imperial wars of expansion, by signs of hypocrisy. America did tip the balance in favor of the right side in two world wars; it did demonstrate uncommon magnanimity in its support for German and Japanese reconstruction and democracy. Even when playing the game of power politics, it retained a measure of credibility as the one underwriter and arbitrator to whom others might resort. 
The resulting ¡°soft power¡± or ¡°soft influence¡± has been a unique asset. Already dissipated to a high degree over the decades of the Global War On Terror, it now is destined to fade into a shadow of its former self. A blatantly racist, xenophobic, studiously ignorant, and belligerent country cannot retain the respect of other governments or the high regard of their peoples. 
A country so feckless as to choose Trump the buffoon as its President is mocking itself. The negative impact will be compounded as the United States is riven by internal conflicts of all kinds, repressive actions and perhaps another serious economic crisis. 
The damage to America¡¯s standing in the world should hardly be a surprise; yet many are inclined to underestimate the effect. One cannot appreciate what we have become by talking to foreign friends on the Washington circuit, or by listening to the polite regrets of those around the world who are interviewed by the media. Walk the streets of cities abroad for unscripted reactions to this historic act of national self-mutilation. 
We can expect that whoever winds up in senior policy positions in a Trump administration will downplay these intangibles ¨C if they even acknowledge them. In this, they will be encouraged by the tradition of self-delusion that has become a feature of American thinking about its place in the world. 
Think of the Middle East where just about everything that we have been doing since 2001 has been guided by a fantastical view of the region ¨C from Iraq, to Syria, to Yemen, to the Gulf, to Turkey, to Palestine and Israel. 
Divorced from Reality 
This tendency to divorce ourselves from reality so as to perpetuate myths of American omnipotence and superiority is also witnessed at the operational level. Consider these examples: President George W. Bush in a flight suit after landing on the USS Abraham Lincoln to give his ¡°Mission Accomplished¡± speech about the Iraq War on May 1, 2003 
¨CThe U.S. habitually characterizes anybody who resists our use of force against them as evil and criminal. Thus, the insurgents in Iraq are ¡°anti-Iraqi¡± forces; the Houthis in Yemen are Iranian proxies, the Palestinians are nothing but terrorists, the Russian population in the Donbas region of Ukraine are Russian commandos directed from the Kremlin with the aim of unraveling all of Europe and NATO, etc. etc. 
¨CAmerican policy-makers find it convenient to pursue strategies that entail squaring circles. The outcome is predictable. The outstanding case in point is Syria where for four years they have committed themselves to ousting Assad by force while continuing the fight against violent Islamist groups. That has placed us in the absurd position of allying with Al Qaeda (providing indirect material, and indirect political support) while still fulminating about the grave danger of terrorism. 
¨CWe present ourselves as the promoter and well-wisher of democracy while giving unstinting support to oppressive regimes in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and elsewhere while facilitating the ouster of democratically elected reformist leaders in Honduras, Bolivia. Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil. 
These self-delusional practices have prepared the psychological ground for the grand illusion to come in assuming that the America of Trump will continue to draw the world¡¯s admiration and its deference to American leadership. 
Normalizing Trump 
The inclination to ¡°normalize¡± the transition in treating Trump, his utterances and his odd-lot entourage as if they somehow could be squeezed into conventional molds is understandable. It is a manifestation of an unwitting coping strategy for coming to terms with the shattering event of his election. 
Americans in general are pursuing a similar psychological strategy for the sake of preserving the conception of themselves and their country deeply rooted in their consciousness. Hence, the impulse to minimize the singularity of this revolutionary development without precedent ¨C not only in the United States but anywhere in the democratic world. This is one instance where American ¡°exceptionalism¡± is not prized. 
This is a natural reaction to a brutal Truth about Americans ¨C and its dire consequences. For the choice of Trump reveals most Americans as immature and prone to juvenile behavior. To vote for Trump is the ultimate act of political immaturity. 
There are, of course, identifiable reasons why many were drawn to the flamboyant candidate, why his demagoguery resonated, why his exaggerated imagery struck a receptive nerve. However, for that emotional response to translate into the actual selection of this man to be President crosses a critical threshold. 
Children ¨C at times ¨C let emotion rule their conduct. Children only weakly feel the imperative to impose logic and a modicum reason on their impulses. Children disregard consequences. Children overlook the downside in their implicit weighing of the balance in giving in to those impulses or not. Grown-ups do not. 
Immediate satisfaction ¨C at all and any cost ¨C does not eclipse other considerations for adults. Even a child¡¯s tantrum usually lasts no more than ten minutes or so. The tantrum of Trump voters has lasted 18 months. 
That¡¯s pathological ¨C anyway you cut it. Admittedly, some Trump supporters share his perverted view of the world ¨C even if contradicted by his own personal history. Let¡¯s say 12 to 15 percent of the electorate. A larger slice was represented by dyed-in-the-wool Republicans who relished sticking it to the Hillary and the Democrats to such a degree that their thrill at the spectacle overcame their realization that Trump was unfit for the office. Indeed, many probably expected him to lose and, therefore, felt free to go along for the fun of it. 
That leaves roughly 10 to 20 percent of the electorate who placed their emotional gratification above their responsibilities as citizens and above the wellbeing of the Republic. That is the difference between the nearly 50 percent he received and what a broad rejection would represent. They constitute the hard core of the culpable juveniles. 
What about those who could not stand Hillary, who felt an irresistible impulse to express that feeling somehow? Many options were open to them: abstain, vote for one of the minor candidates, go to the gym and exhaust oneself on an elliptical trainer, get drunk, smoke some weed, pick a fight with one¡¯s spouse. Any of these represents more grown-up behavior than voting for Donald Trump. 
By comparison, in France when Jean Marie Le Pen ¨C candidate of the racist far-right party, the Front National ¨C FN, made it into the second round of their presidential election, he and his party were rejected by 82.2 percent of the electorate. In other words, the French rallied together to reject Le Pen. That is what a mature polity does. And Le Pen is sane, albeit a crypto-fascist.

The Democratic Party¡¯s long sojourn into corporate-friendly politics ¨C and neglect of its old working-class base ¨C has led to the shocking result of an erratic and untested outsider becoming President. But is there a route back, asks Joe Lauria. 
By Joe Lauria 
A new political force in America was unleashed on Tuesday and how the Democratic Party reacts to it could determine its future as a major party. Millions of discontented Americans who have lost out to the computerization and the globalization of the economy ¨C and who have been disproportionately called on to fight America¡¯s ¡°regime change¡± wars ¨C have made clear that they aren¡¯t going to take it anymore. And any party or politician going forward better listen or they will be tossed out, too, including Donald Trump if he doesn¡¯t deliver. 
This election has struck what should be a fatal blow to the Clintons¡¯ Democratic Leadership Council movement. Bill Clinton moved the Democratic Party to the center-right at about the same time that Tony Blair did with the British Labour Party. Both parties cut many of their traditional ties to labor unions in the 1990s to embrace the economic neoliberalism of their 1980s predecessors Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher: welfare reform, deregulation of the financial sector and ¡°free trade.¡± The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads ¡°Vote Trump¡± on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr) 
The effect on workers across the old industrial belts has been devastating. Millions have been pushed out of a middle-class lifestyle. They have seen their plants close and jobs shipped to cheap labor markets overseas. Or they have lost out to robotics. 
They¡¯ve also seen the economy shift from production to financial speculation. And they¡¯ve seen the greatest transfer of wealth in decades to the obscenely rich. Wealthy liberals who¡¯ve benefited from this shift often act as if they are morally superior to the system¡¯s ¡°losers¡± who hear Hillary Clinton put them in a ¡°basket of deplorables.¡± 
On Tuesday, these downwardly mobile workers spoke out, giving Trump the votes he needed in the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin to put him over the top in the Electoral College (although Clinton appears headed toward a plurality of the votes nationally.) 
That someone as eminently unqualified (at least in the traditional sense) could flip the electoral map in this way was stunning. But is the Democratic Party listening and can it adapt to reflect the interests of these Americans? The future of the party may depend on it. 
For the past two decades, Democrats have relied on the support of these Rust Belt states as a bulwark for their national candidacies. These states voted twice for Barack Obama. 
But many of these blue-collar workers were counting on a significant change to their circumstances, but Obama had failed to deliver that and Clinton only vaguely addressed their concerns with a variety of mostly small-bore policy ideas. Many of these voters judged that the Democrats couldn¡¯t or wouldn¡¯t deliver. So, they rudely slapped the party in the face. 
Parallel political trends are playing out in Great Britain, where a discontented working class spearheaded the Brexit withdrawal from the European Union and where Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is fighting to dismantle Blair¡¯s so-called New Labour movement and trying to restore the Labour Party¡¯s historic ties to the working class. 
Last week , we learned in a leaked speech that Bill Clinton gave last year that he denigrated Corbyn, saying Labour ¡°went out and practically got a guy off the street to be the leader¡± of the party. ¡°When people feel they¡¯ve been shafted and they don¡¯t expect anything to happen anyway, they just want the maddest person in the room to represent them.¡± 
Bill Clinton¡¯s remarks were typical of the Democrats¡¯ smugness and their contempt for ordinary people. So there was some satisfaction in seeing the humiliation of these careerist and corporatist Democrats on Tuesday. 
Now, the Democratic Party had better figure out how they can serve the interests of those blue-collar workers or the party can expect more of the same. So far they are blaming everyone and everthing for having created this workers¡¯ backlash: sexism, the media, FBI Director James Comey (Clinton pinned it specifically on him), Vladimir Putin, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and even Clinton cheerleader Bernie Sanders (for ¡°poisoning the youth vote¡±). 
A former Clinton operative speaking on Fox News said the day after an election loss is a time to engage in the ¡°blame game.¡± He said ¡°everybody is being blamed but Secretary Clinton.¡± 
Pursuing Solutions 
There are solutions to economic injustice but few in power pursue them because it¡¯s not in their self-interest. And politicians of any party act primarily on self-interest these days, which usually translates into the interests of their wealthy financial backers and is thus inimical to real democracy. President Bill Clinton 
Without a sharp turn to the left to regain workers¡¯ support, the Democratic Party risks becoming totally irrelevant. A new batch of Democratic Party leaders committed to workers must emerge. They have four years to prepare. 
Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren tarnished themselves as leaders who can achieve this by supporting a center-right candidate in Hillary Clinton. They failed to acknowledge that Clinton was too alienated from many blue-collar workers (especially whites) who in the end abandoned the party to gamble on Trump. 
Sanders, an independent who chose to run in the Democratic primaries, had been offered the top of the Green Party ticket. The party¡¯s   Jill Stein, who was willing to give up that spot, said he never answered her. Had they run together they might have gotten the 15 percent in the polls to enter the debates where Sanders would have been a lofty alternative to Clinton and Trump ¨C though had Trump still won on Nov. 8, Sanders surely would have been denounced as a ¡°sore loser¡± and blamed for ¡°dividing the anti-Trump vote.¡± 
As it turned out, the Democrats managed to lose the White House to Trump on their own. Though the Democratic leadership won¡¯t admit it, they now know that Sanders was running the right campaign to defend workers¡¯ interests and would have been the right messenger to carry that message. However, to protect their own privileged class interests and those of their donors, establishment Democrats left the country open to the dangerous victory of Donald Trump. 
Rust Belt working-class voters can¡¯t be blamed for the choices they were given. Without Sanders ¨C and with the Democrats offering one more establishment candidate ¨C these alienated voters instead sent a demagogue to the White House, clinging to the hope that he might keep some of his promises: to end ruinous trade deals, bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S., create jobs by rebuilding the infrastructure, avoid new wars and clean the D.C. swamp of corruption. 
Judging by the people being mentioned for his Cabinet, it¡¯s already looking dodgy: the usual cast of right-wing Republicans ¨C the likes of Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani ¨C who have been part of the problem going back decades. 
Yet, if Trump fails to fulfill his promises to improve the economy for common Americans, the voters he so skillfully riled up might well send him packing in 2020 unless, of course, the Democrats put up another corporate choice. 
That leaves the notoriously difficult path for a third party that could represent the interests of ordinary Americans. But that possibility showed little traction in 2016, with marginal vote totals for both the Libertarian and Green parties. 
Media Also Repudiated 
On the positive side, this election became a repudiation not only of the Democratic Party insiders, but also of establishment Republicans, Wall Street, celebrity culture (with famous people flocking to Clinton) and the mainstream news media. The Pentagon, headquarters of the U.S. Defense Department, as viewed with the Potomac River and Washington, D.C., in the background. (Defense Department photo) 
The shock to the American political system also is prompting admissions one would never have imagined hearing. On Fox News the morning after the election, a group of personalities (calling themselves ¡°journalists¡±) were suddenly talking about class in America, a normally taboo subject. 
One of them said journalists didn¡¯t understand this election because none of them know anyone who makes less than $60,000 a year. Apparently, these pampered performers don¡¯t even mix with many members of their own profession. I can introduce them to plenty of journalists making less than that, let alone Rust Belt workers. 
Will Rahn of CBS News accused the media of missing the story ¡°after having spent months mocking the people who had a better sense of what was going on. This is all symptomatic of modern journalism¡¯s great moral and intellectual failing: its unbearable smugness .¡± 
Rahn said working-class people have ¡°captured the imagination of journalists, who have come to talk about them like colonial administrators would talk about a primitive inland tribe that interferes with the construction of a jungle railway: They must be pacified until history kills them off.¡± 
These are stunning admissions that would never have happened without this election result. But one wonders how long such introspection in the corporate media will last. After the mainstream media got the Iraq WMD story wrong and contributed to the disastrous 2003 invasion, there were a few halfhearted mea culpas but very little accountability. 
For instance, Washington Post editorial-page editor Fred Hiatt, who repeatedly wrote as flat fact that Iraq was hiding WMD and who mocked the few dissenting voices trying to warn Americans about the flimsiness of the evidence, is still the editorial-page editor of The Washington Post. 
So, not surprisingly ¨C with almost none of the ¡°star journalists¡± suffering any career setbacks ¨C the corporate media was soon joining more propaganda campaigns for more wars, which are mostly fought by young working-class men and women who actually do suffer. 
The difference now is that this new political force of fed-up voters ¨C who ¡°came out of nowhere¡± as far as the Democrats and the media were concerned although these voters were staring them in the face ¨C might now force a re-evaluation. That¡¯s because these voters are likely still to be there four years from now.

Republicans are claiming a mandate to speak for the ¡°silent majority,¡± but the actual numbers show that not only did Donald Trump fail to win a plurality, his vote total largely matched other recent GOP candidates, notes Nicolas J S Davies. 
By Nicolas J S Davies 
Within days of the U.S. general election, central elements of the result have already entered into American mythology: the revenge of the ¡°white working class voter¡±; the unprecedented anti-establishment character of the President-elect; the populist revolution that led to Trump¡¯s victory; and the years in the wilderness now facing Democrats and progressives in America. 
But the endless repetition of these themes by the corporate media deserves a great deal more skepticism and scrutiny before they worm their way into all our heads to form the established and accepted narrative of this election. Let¡¯s first review some basic facts about what happened on Nov. 8: Donald Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention. (Photo credit: Grant Miller/RNC) 
Who Voted Republican? 
Though Donald Trump prevailed in the Electoral College, he failed to secure a plurality of the total ballots cast, getting a bit over 60 million votes to Hillary Clinton¡¯s 61 million votes, according to The Associated Press tally . Meanwhile, only 55.6 percent of 219 million eligible voters, or 50.4 percent of the voting-age population , actually voted, placing the U.S. 33rd out of 35 advanced (OECD) countries in national voter turnout , above only Chile and Switzerland. 
Only 27 percent of eligible voters or 24 percent of the voting-age population voted for Trump. Roughly the same number, about 60 million, voted for both John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. The result was different because Barack Obama received 69 million votes in 2008 and 66 million in 2012, while Hillary Clinton could only muster only a shade more than Trump, Romney and McCain. 
As Sen. Bernie Sanders repeated in every stump speech during the Democratic primaries, ¡°Let us never forget, Democrats and progressives win when voter turnout is high. Republicans win when people are demoralized and voter turnout is low.¡± 
So, Trump deserves credit for finding a few new Republican voters to replace those who have died in the past fou4 years, and for a successful strategy to gain votes in the right states to win the Electoral College. But the more decisive difference with 2008 and 2012 was the dramatic failure of the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, to turn out the vote. This was despite, or maybe even because of, unprecedented SuperPAC money and overwhelming support from political, business and media elites. 
Democratic Hopes 
If the Democrats hope to do better in future elections, they must confront this reality. Grassroots Democrats should insist that party leaders finally abandon the long obsolete Reagan/Thatcher-lite Democratic Leadership Council model of politics based on fund-raising, propaganda, corporate welfare and militarism, and welcome the kind of new, progressive leadership that inspired 47 percent of Democratic primary voters to vote for Senator Bernie Sanders. Sen. Bernie Sanders speaking to one of his large crowds of supporters. (Photo credit: Sanders campaign) 
This was all the more significant and impressive in the context of party leaders¡¯ monolithic support for Clinton and their shameful campaign to stage a coronation instead of organizing a free and fair primary election. 
We will find out more about who actually voted for Trump, but the pollster Nate Silver already exposed ¡°The Myth of Trump¡¯s ¡®Working Class¡¯ Support¡± in a fivethirtyeight .com article on May 3. Silver¡¯s article analyzed a survey of the average household income of people who voted in the 23 primaries up to that point. The average Clinton or Sanders primary voter had a household income of $61,000, while the average Trump voter earned $72,000, about the same as Cruz¡¯s supporters but less than Kasich¡¯s. 
The 70 percent of eligible voters who did not vote in either primary had an average household income of $52,000. In broad terms, this tracks the traditional pattern of U.S. politics, with wealthier Americans leaning Republican, the middle-class favoring Democrats and few of the poor African-Americans and immigrants who make up much of the real U.S. working-class voting at all. 
These figures were for primary voters, but they suggest that Trump¡¯s supporters were, well, Republicans, like Romney¡¯s, McCain¡¯s, Bush¡¯s and so on. The Republican Party has continually rebranded itself over the past 50 years, generating great fanfares from deferential or captive corporate media for the Silent Majority, the Reagan Revolution, the Moral Majority, the Christian Right, the Contract With America, the Tea Party and now Trump¡¯s Deplorables, but behind these well-funded P.R. campaigns, Republican voters remain roughly the same people or class of people. Edward Bernays, the father of modern propaganda and advertising, would approve their ever-changing public message! 
What is Trump¡¯s agenda? 
Despite contradictory pronouncements on many issues, Donald Trump¡¯s published plan for his first 100 days in office contained more policy details than Hillary Clinton¡¯s campaign web site, which followed the DLC model of appealing to principles most Americans believe in without pinning the candidate down to anything detailed enough for most voters to disagree with. 
In Clinton¡¯s case, this includes voluminous treatises on a wide array of subjects, but the blizzard of words was short on actual policy details, leaving the formerly presumptive president plenty of room to do whatever she and her corporate and military-industrial colleagues really planned to do after the coronation. As Wikileaks revealed, one of the few things Clinton¡¯s staff and financiers were clear on was the necessarily wide gap between her public and private positions . 
Warmed-Over GOP Fare 
On the other hand, Donald Trump¡¯s plan for his first 100 days in office includes more specifics and is, for the most part, a pretty standard wish-list of policies the Republican Party has backed for decades. That still leaves plenty of room for smoke and mirrors: President Obama in the Oval Office. 
¨COn Trump¡¯s first day in office, he plans to cancel every ¡°unconstitutional¡± action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama; to cancel federal funding to cities that provide sanctuary to undocumented immigrants; to begin deporting 2 million undocumented immigrants ¡°with criminal records¡± (somehow expanding that group from the 178,000 counted in a 2010 Congressional report before Obama¡¯s mass deportations reduced it still further); to stop issuing U.S. visas to people in countries that won¡¯t accept unlimited numbers of U.S. deportees; to suspend immigration from ¡°terror-prone¡± regions; and to begin work on selecting a new Supreme Court justice. 
¨CThe legislative portion of Trump¡¯s agenda starts with ¡°massive tax reduction,¡± including an across-the-board 15 percent corporate tax rate, which drops to 10 percent for repatriated offshore earnings to reward the outsourcing he condemned on the campaign trail. This is balanced politically by a vague promise of unspecified new tariffs to penalize future outsourcing. 
¨C¡°The American Energy and Infrastructure Act¡± will declare open season on the environment and the climate, stimulating ¡°energy infrastructure¡± projects like the Keystone XL pipeline with tax cuts and corporate welfare, and ending U.S. payments to the U.N. climate fund. 
¨CA national school voucher program will expand the privatization of public education, while Trump also pays lip service to local control, reducing college tuition and ending common core. 
¨CTrump wants to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a new program based on health savings accounts, along with similar programs for childcare and elder care; states will be allowed to make unprecedented cuts in Medicaid; and he wants the Food and Drug Administration to speed up approvals for 4,000 new drugs. 
¨CAs well as funding Trump¡¯s wall on the Mexican border, new draconian immigration laws will impose mandatory 2- and 5-year federal prison sentences on previously deported immigrants who try to reenter the U.S. 
¨CNew ¡°national security¡± and ¡°community safety¡± laws will blast military spending past Obama¡¯s post-World War II record , and throw more money at local police to combat imaginary increases in ¡°crime, drugs and violence¡± at home. Liberal state marijuana laws may be ¡°trumped¡± by this new national ¡°stop and frisk¡± program. 
¨CTrump wants term limits in Congress to get rid of popular progressive legislators like John Conyers and Patrick Leahy. He also wants a federal civilian hiring freeze and sweeping deregulation under which any new federal regulation must be offset by canceling two existing regulations. 
Controlling the Levers 
The most critical factor in the Republicans¡¯ new-found power is that they now control the White House and both houses of Congress, as they did from 2003 to 2006 and for a shorter spell in 1953-54. This does not usually end well for them. The last time the Republicans held full control of the U.S. government for more than 4 years was in the 1920s, and that ended even worse. President George W. Bush speaks on the phone in the Oval Office, Oct. 7, 2008, with Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom, discussing efforts to solve the spreading global financial crisis. (White House photo by Eric Draper) 
If the Republicans exploit the support of 24 percent of Americans ¨C not even a plurality of those who voted ¨C to ram through their extreme right-wing agenda, they will deserve to be slung out on their ears in 2018 and 2020, as they were in 2006 and 2008. 
If rank-and-file Democrats can force their party¡¯s corrupt leaders to quickly hand over power to new progressive leadership who will represent the other 76 percent of Americans, this should not be a tall order. 
In the meantime, progressives can contain the damage by countering every part of the Republicans¡¯ (and corrupt Democrats¡¯) agenda with clear, intelligent progressive proposals for real solutions to the serious problems facing our country and the world and building a popular movement around them. 
This will all be a real test for the Democrats, but it is one they have brought on themselves, and the radical clean-up required is what progressives have been demanding of the Democratic Party for a long time.

Though President-elect Trump seems ready to reduce tensions with Russia, his consideration of neocon John Bolton as Secretary of State could presage more Mideast warmongering toward Iran, writes Gareth Porter at Middle East Eye. 
By Gareth Porter 
Post-election comments on Middle East policy last week by President-elect Donald Trump and one his campaign advisers have provoked speculation about whether Trump will upend two main foreign policy lines of the Obama administration in the Middle East. 
But the more decisive question about the future of U.S. policy toward the region is whom Trump will pick for his national security team ¨C and especially whether he will nominate John Bolton to become Secretary of State. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. 
Bolton, one of the most notorious members of Dick Cheney¡¯s team plotting wars in the George W. Bush administration, would certainly push for the effective nullification of the main political barrier to U.S. confrontation with Iran: the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal. 
Trump created a minor stir by giving an interview to the Wall Street Journal last Thursday in which he reiterated his criticism of the Obama administration¡¯s involvement in the war against Syria¡¯s Assad and supported cooperation with Russia against the Islamic State group. And a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser once connected with an extremist sectarian Christian militia in Lebanon named Walid Phares suggested in an interview with BBC radio that Trump would demand that Iran ¡°change [a] few issues¡± in the agreement and that ¡°the agreement as it is right now ¡­ is not going to be accepted by a Trump administration¡±. 
The significance of that interview, however, is very unclear. Trump himself had avoided threatening such a move during the campaign, denouncing the nuclear agreement as ¡°disastrous¡± but avoiding any pledge to renounce it as his Republican rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio had done. In his speech to AIPAC, Trump thundered against the agreement but promised only to enforce it strictly and hold Iran ¡°accountable.¡± 
Trump has consistently embraced the long-standing official U.S. animosity toward Iran, but thus far he has given no indication that he intends to provoke an unnecessary crisis with Iran. 
In any case, Trump¡¯s own views will only be the starting point for policymaking on Syria and Iran. His national security team will have the power to initiate policy proposals as well as effective veto power over Trump¡¯s foreign policy preferences. That is why Trump¡¯s choices of nominations for the top positions on national security will certainly be the crucial factor in determining what policy lines ultimately emerge on those issues ¨C and why the real possibility of Bolton¡¯s nomination as Secretary of State now represents the greatest threat to international peace and security. 
Undermining Obama 
Barack Obama became president with a firm intention to get U.S. combat forces out of Iraq within 16 months as he had promised during the campaign. But in his very first meeting with CENTCOM Commander Gen. David Petraeus, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen in late January 2009, Petraeus and his two allies pressed Obama to back down on his pledge, arguing that it wasn¡¯t realistic.

Neither played a particularly prominent role in the operation. (White House photo by Pete Souza) 
In the end, Obama accepted a scheme devised by the military and Pentagon officials under which combat brigades remained in Iraq long after the August 2010 Obama deadline for their withdrawal with no reduction in combat capability. They were simply given additional tasks of advising and assisting Iraqi military units and renamed ¡°advisory and assistance brigades.¡± 
Later in 2009, Obama¡¯s national security team, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, pushed for a major U.S. military escalation in Afghanistan in 2009-2010. Obama didn¡¯t buy the arguments by Petraeus, Gates and Mullen for a huge increase in U.S. troops in Afghanistan. He and Vice-President Joe Biden argued that the implosion of Pakistan was a much bigger problem than Afghanistan and that there was no evidence of a threat that Al Qaeda would return to Afghanistan. But the war coalition leaked a story to the press that the White House was ignoring a new intelligence assessment that the Afghan Taliban would invite Al Qaeda back into the country if they won the war. 
In fact, the intelligence community had produced no such assessment, but the proponents of a big counterinsurgency effort in Afghanistan were demonstrating their power to use the media to raise the political cost to Obama of resisting their demand. Obama gave in on the additional troops, again imposing a deadline for their withdrawal, and the U.S. is still engaged in a losing war in Afghanistan seven years later. 
Those largely unknown episodes underline just how vulnerable Donald Trump will be as president to pressures from his national security team to support policies with which he may disagree ¨C unless he chooses people who agree with his policy preferences. But Trump has a peculiar problem in that regard. Because he has already alienated virtually the entire Republican Party national security elite by attacking sacred cows such as NATO, and he has been boycotted by the corps of senior officials from the George W. Bush administration ¨C except for Bolton. 
War with Iran 
Although he is best known as U.S. Ambassador the United Nations in the George. W. Bush administration, it was in his previous role as Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security from 2001 through 2004 that he played his most important role in U.S. foreign policy. Iran¡¯s President Hassan Rouhani celebrates the completion of an interim deal on Iran¡¯s nuclear program on Nov. 24, 2013, by kissing the head of the daughter of an assassinated Iranian nuclear engineer. (Iranian government photo) 
Although the story was never covered in the corporate news media, I have recounted in my history of the Iran nuclear issue how Bolton, with the full approval of Vice President Dick Cheney and in coordination with Israel, began in 2003 to implement a strategy aimed ultimately at maneuvering the U.S. into a military confrontation with Iran. The strategy relied on the accusation that the Islamic Republic was carrying out a covert nuclear weapons program. 
Bolton and Cheney failed to get their war with Iran, and Bolton was moved to the United Nations in the second Bush term. But Bolton has never stopped talking about the need for the United States to bomb Iran. 
In a New York Post op-ed on Nov. 14, he called on Trump to ¡°abrogate¡± the nuclear agreement on his first day in office. He wants to be Secretary of State in order to pursue just such a policy, and he is under serious consideration, according to news reports last week. If he were nominated as Secretary of State it would be an open invitation for more plotting of schemes within the Trump administration for the war against Iran that Bolton still craves. 
Bolton would not necessarily prevail in pushing for a direct military confrontation with Iran over the nuclear issue, because the U.S. military would probably exercise its veto over any policy that risks war with Iran. But he could nevertheless provoke a crisis with Iran by subverting the agreement itself. He would begin by trying to get Trump to stop using his presidential waiver power to carry out its provisions on lifting sanctions against Iran. 
Under normal circumstances, Bolton would never have a chance to reprise his role as war provocateur, but the political circumstances today are anything but normal. There is a very real danger that the Trump transition team will turn to him because it sees no alternative among the usual suspects. 
The only alternative is to turn to a seasoned diplomat who has not served in senior national security positions in a Republican administration. And if the choices for other top positions are not determined to avoid the kind of confrontation that Bolton would try to provoke, he could conceivably succeed. 
So the disintegration of the political order controlled by the old Democratic and Republican party elites could spawn new threats of war unless Trump and his advisers are clever enough to see the need to avoid them in their choices of national security officials in the coming days.

Special Report: Donald Trump¡¯s unlikely victory created the opportunity to finally break with the orthodoxy of Washington¡¯s neocon/liberal-hawk foreign policy, but can Trump find enough fresh thinkers to do the job, asks Robert Parry. 
By Robert Parry 
Donald Trump must decide ¨C and decide quickly ¨C whether he wants to be a great U.S. President or a robo-signature machine affixing his name to whatever legislation comes from congressional Republicans and a nodding figurehead acquiescing to more neoconservative foreign policy adventures. 
Or, to put it in a vernacular that Trump might use, does he want to be ¡°Paul Ryan¡¯s bitch¡± on domestic policies? And does he want to surrender his foreign policy to the ¡°wise guys¡± of Washington¡¯s neocon establishment. Donald Trump speaking with supporters in Phoenix, Arizona. June 18, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) 
Trump¡¯s problem is that he has few fully developed ideas about how to proceed in a presidency that even many of his close followers did not expect would happen. Plus, over the past few decades, the neocons and their liberal-hawk sidekicks have marginalized almost every dissenting expert, including old-line ¡°realists¡± who once were important figures. 
So, the bench of ¡°confirmable¡± experts who have dissented on neocon/liberal-hawk policies is very thin. To find national security leaders who would break with the prevailing ¡°group thinks,¡± Trump would have go outside normal channels and take a risk on some fresh thinkers. 
But most mainstream media accounts doubt that he will. That is why speculation has centered on Trump settling on several neocon retreads for Secretary of State and National Security Advisor, such as former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former CIA Director James Woolsey and ex-National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, all staunch supporters of George W. Bush¡¯s disastrous Iraq War which Trump has denounced. 
¡®Team of Rivals¡¯ 
If Trump is guided in that direction, he will make the same mistake that President Barack Obama made during the 2008 transition when Obama was seduced by the idea of a Lincoln-esque ¡°Team of Rivals¡± and staffed key top national security jobs with hawks ¡ª keeping Bush¡¯s Defense Secretary Robert Gates , hiring Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and leaving in place top generals, such as David Petraeus . 
That decision trapped the inexperienced Obama into a policy of continuity with Bush¡¯s wars and related policies, such as domestic spying, rather than enabling Obama to achieve his promised ¡°change.¡± 
Faced with powerful ¡°rivals¡± within his own administration, Obama was maneuvered into an ill-considered ¡°counterinsurgency¡± escalation in Afghanistan in 2009 that did little more than get another 1,000 U.S. soldiers killed along with many more Afghans. 
Secretary Clinton also sold out the elected progressive president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, when he was ousted in a coup in 2009, signaling to Latin America that ¡°El Norte¡± hadn¡¯t changed much. 
Then, Clinton sabotaged Obama¡¯s first attempt in 2010 to enlist the help of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to work out a deal with Iran on constraining its nuclear program. Clinton favored an escalating confrontation with Iran along the lines dictated by Israeli hardliners. 
Clinton and the other hawks succeeded in thwarting Obama¡¯s will because, as Gates wrote in his memoir Duty , Gates and Clinton were ¡°un-fireable¡± in that they could challenge Obama whenever they wished while realizing that Obama would have to pay an unacceptably high price to remove them. 
As clever ¡°inside players,¡± Gates, Clinton and Petraeus also understood that if Obama balked at their policy prescriptions, they could undercut him by going to friends in the mainstream news media and leaking information about how Obama was ¡°weak¡± in not supporting a more warlike approach to problems. 
Obama¡¯s Real Weakness 
Yet, by failing to stand up to this neocon/liberal-hawk pressure , Obama did make himself weak. Essentially, he never got control of his foreign policy and even after the Gates-Clinton-Petraeus trio was gone by the start of Obama¡¯s second term, the President still feared angering Washington¡¯s foreign policy establishment which often followed the heed of Israel¡¯s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. President Barack Obama stands with Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the President¡¯s official arrival ceremony in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 2013. (Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) 
Obama was so worried about Israel that, at the apex of his power after winning reelection in 2012, Obama went on a several-day trip to visit Netanyahu in a craven attempt to show his love and obeisance to Israel. Obama took similar trips to Saudi Arabia. 
Still, that was not enough to spare him the wrath of Netanyahu and the Saudi royals when Obama finally pushed successfully for an Iran nuclear deal in 2014. Netanyahu humiliated Obama by accepting a Republican invitation in 2015 to speak to a joint session of Congress where he urged U.S. lawmakers to repudiate their own President. 
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia demanded and got new concessions from Obama on arms sales and his grudging support for their proxy war in Syria as well as their direct aerial bombardment of Yemen ¨C both part of a Sunni Wahhabist sectarian strategy for destroying Shiite-related regimes. (The Sunni/Shiite clash dates back to the Seventh Century.) 
Indeed, the little-recognized Israeli-Saudi alliance targeting the so-called ¡°Shiite crescent¡± ¨C Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Iran ¨C is at the heart of what has been driving U.S. policy in the Middle East since the 1990s. 
And, if President-elect Trump wants to truly reverse the downward spiral of the United States as it has squandered trillions of dollars in futile Mideast wars, he will have to go up against the Israeli-Saudi tandem and make it clear that he will not be manipulated as Obama was. Saudi King Salman bids farewell to President Barack Obama at Erga Palace after a state visit to Saudi Arabia on Jan. 27, 2015. (Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) 
Facing down such a powerful coalition of Israel (with its extraordinary U.S. lobbying apparatus) and Saudi Arabia (with its far-reaching financial clout) would require both imagination and courage. It would not be possible if Trump surrounds himself with senior advisers under the thumb of Prime Minister Netanyahu and King Salman. 
So, we will learn a great deal about whether Trump is a real player or just a pretender when he selects his foreign policy team. Will he find imaginative new thinkers who can break the disastrous cycles of Mideast wars and reduce tensions with Russia or will he just tap into the usual suspects of Republican orthodoxy? 
Sunlight on the Swamp 
Trump could also show his independence from Republican orthodoxy by recognizing that government secrecy has gone way too far, a drift into opacity that dates back to Ronald Reagan and his reversal of the more open-government policies of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. 
Trump says he wants to ¡°drain the swamp¡± of Washington, but to do that first requires letting in much more sunlight and sharing much more information with the American people. 
For starters ¨C assuming that the timid Obama won¡¯t take the risk ¨C President Trump could pardon national security whistleblowers who have faced or could face prosecution, such as Chelsea Manning, Julian Assange, John Kiriakou, Jeffrey Sterling and Edward Snowden. 
That could be followed by an executive order forbidding excessive secrecy inside the federal government, recognizing that ¡°We the People¡± are the nation¡¯s true sovereigns and thus deserve as much information as possible while protecting necessary secrets. 
Trump could show he means business about respecting average American citizens by sharing with them U.S. intelligence assessments on key controversies, such as the Aug. 21, 2013 sarin gas attack in Syria and the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 shoot-down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014. [See here and here. ] 
The Obama administration has engaged in selective release of information about these mysteries to manipulate U.S. public opinion, not to inform and thus empower the American people. Trump could go a long way toward restoring public trust by renouncing such tricks. 
He also could save many billions of dollars by shutting down U.S. propaganda agencies whose role also is to use various P.R. tricks to shape both foreign and domestic opinion, often in the cause of ¡°regime changes¡± or ¡°color revolutions.¡± 
Trump could shut down the State Department¡¯s Office of Public Diplomacy , return the U.S. Agency for International Development to its legitimate purpose of helping poor countries build schools and drill wells, and shutter the trouble-making National Endowment for Democracy . 
By steering the world away from the New Cold War with nuclear-armed Russia, Trump could not only help save the future of mankind, he could save trillions of dollars that otherwise would end up in the pockets of the Military-Industrial Complex. 
FDR or Coolidge? 
Regarding domestic policy, some Republicans expect that Trump will simply sign off on whatever Ayn-Rand-inspired legislation that House Speaker Ryan pushes through Congress, whether turning Medicare into a voucher program or privatizing Social Security. President Franklin Roosevelt 
In this area, too, Trump will have to decide whether he wants to be a great president in the mold of Franklin Roosevelt or someone more of the caliber of Calvin Coolidge. 
Trump also must face the reality that he has lost the popular vote by a rather significant margin ¨C almost a million votes in the latest tallies ¨C and thus only has the presidency because of the archaic Electoral College. In other words, he lacks a real mandate from the people. 
When confronted with a similar situation in 2000, George W. Bush chose to pretend that he had a decisive mandate for his right-wing policies, shoved them down the Democrats¡¯ throats (such as his massive tax cut mostly for the rich that wiped out the budget surplus), and eventually saw his failed presidency sink into bitter partisanship. 
Republicans will surely urge Trump to do the same, to ignore the popular vote, but he might do well to surprise people by looking for overlapping areas where Democrats and Republicans can cooperate. 
For instance, many Democrats fear that Trump will undo the difficult progress made on climate change over the past eight years. After all, Trump has voiced doubts about the scientific consensus on the existential threat posed by global warming. 
But Trump also wants to invest heavily in America¡¯s infrastructure (plus he has vowed to help the inner cities). So, there¡¯s potential common ground if Trump were to launch a major program to create a world-class mass transit system for urban and suburban areas. 
Trump might even turn to one of his critics, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, for Transportation Secretary with instructions to study mass transit in Japan and Europe and implement a similar system in the United States, quickly. Besides creating jobs and improving life for urban dwellers (who largely supported Hillary Clinton), quality and fast mass transit could get millions of Americans out of their cars and thus help in the fight against global warming, too. 
To demonstrate a willingness to reach across the aisle on such important issues, Trump might even consider offering Energy Secretary to Al Gore. 
But such bold steps would require Trump to have the courage and creativity to go against the Republican ¡°playbook¡± which calls for a zero-sum game against the Democrats. 
Whether Trump has such courage and foresight is the pressing question of the moment. Will he go for true greatness (both for himself and America) or will he be content to have his name and face on one of those place mats showing the 45 U.S. Presidents?

America¡¯s liberal elitists, who look down on the discontented working class and put up a presidential candidate representing a failed Establishment, set the stage for Donald Trump¡¯s victory, journalist John Pilger tells Dennis J Bernstein.By Dennis J Bernstein 
Despite Donald Trump¡¯s long history of stiffing workers, dodging taxes and abusing women, he will become the 45th President of the United States, a remarkable turn of events that has a lot of liberals and Democrats scratching their heads and wondering how he could have beaten the powerful Clinton political/money machine. 
One person who was not surprised was journalist and filmmaker John Pilger, who was born in Sydney, Australia, and now is based in London. Pilger has reported from all over the world, covering numerous wars, notably Vietnam. When he was in his 20¡¯s, he became the youngest journalist to receive Britain¡¯s highest award for journalism, Journalist of the Year, which he won twice. He also has an Emmy and his most recent book is Hidden Agendas and the New Rulers of the World . 
Dennis Bernstein: I¡¯m going to ask you later on about the new film, which I¡¯m very excited about. But let¡¯s begin with [the Nov. 8] victory over Clinton, by Trump. Were you surprised? What do you think was at the core of the Trump victory? Journalist John Pilger (Wikipedia) 
John Pilger: You know, I wasn¡¯t surprised. Brexit undoubtedly helped this. I wasn¡¯t surprised. I think I¡¯m quite surprised by how decisive his victory is. But I must say I felt rather angry, and I think we probably expended enough anger on Trump. He¡¯ll, no doubt, provide us with plenty of material coming up. But I think it¡¯s time for people, so-called liberal people, to look in the mirror. 
Who created Trump? Who created this disastrous election, so-called campaign? In my opinion the enablers of all of this was the liberal class, in the United States. The liberal class has refused to acknowledge, in its arrogance, the huge disaffection and discontent among ordinary people. And painting them in such broad strokes has been¡­ what did Clinton call them?¡­¡±deplorables¡± and ¡°irredeemable¡±? That¡¯s really disgraceful. 
DB: Yes, that¡¯s my father. 
JP: You know, Clinton was an extremely dangerous prospect. Dangerous because she represented a war making, rapacious status quo. The status quo would have, actually, altered slightly under her. It¡¯s my understanding, in fact, I believe that she might have provoked a very major war, with Syria and with Russia. 
We don¡¯t know what Trump will do. We have to now, putting aside all the parodies and the abuse, we have to now be thinking in terms of practicalities. He¡¯s running the show. What will he do? But I think before we do that, again, we have to reflect on all the myths. 
I heard a Harvard professor on the BBC, on the very night, before the count began, talk about the hard left in the Democratic Party, and how she would have to embrace the idea of Bernie Sanders and what he stood for. You know, this kind of drivel, and misrepresentation has been everywhere. The media, personally, and I¡¯m speaking of journalists, produced probably the most unfettered propaganda I can remember at any time. In my career, this has been the worst. 
There was no serious attempt, really, to analyze and examine either candidate and what they stood for. Trump was dismissed as a demon, with all the salacious stuff around him, undoubtedly some of it true, and all of that. But he was a serious candidate, he was never analyzed, and that¡¯s why there¡¯s a great surprise, and a great shock. 
And, it¡¯s something that liberal America has to start coming to terms with itself. We had Barack Obama presented seriously as a candidate of hope and real change. He was nothing of the kind. He was in fact a warmonger. He¡¯s got four wars going at once. He conducted an international terrorist campaign using drones. He has prosecuted more whistleblowers than any president in American history. And, you know, when you think of Trump¡¯s disgraceful remarks about throwing people out of the country, and building a wall¡­ who is the Deporter-in-Chief? The liberal Barack Obama. He has deported more people than any other president. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers arresting suspects during a raid in 2010. (Photo Courtesy of ICE) 
So, all of these facts have been lost and they represent a real crisis for the opposition in the United States, the broad opposition. Barack Obama¡¯s great achievement was that he killed off the anti-war movement, because people, doe-eyed from the beginning, thought that Barack Obama was some kind of genuine inspirational liberal, instead of the warmonger that he is. I think there¡¯s a lot of these people [who] are going to be listening to your program, they need to hear this. 
Say that there is a real opposition to Trump and what he¡¯s going to do. We don¡¯t know what he¡¯s going to do, but also an understanding of his constituency, the majority of Americans eligible to vote voted for him. That¡¯s a fact that has to be come to terms with, we have to come to terms with. 
DB: You know I think, John Pilger, you know I¡¯m thinking about all the things Hillary Clinton accused by Trump of, oh, you know, supporting Bill Clinton¡¯s attacks on women, and molestations. I¡¯m not really interested in that, at this point, because what I¡¯m interested in is how she sustained Bill Clinton¡¯s war policy. You remember Layla Al-Attar, right? You remember how Bill Clinton sowed his oats in his first days of his presidency by killing this leading artist of the Middle East who welcomed women into the art world, an unusual situation. It happened in the context of Hillary Clinton giving her famous speech in Beijing about women. But she never mentioned Layla Al-Attar. She never apologized to the family. Layla¡¯s daughter was blinded, in that attack. She was getting operations, getting medical treatment near Stanford where the Clintons would go visit Chelsea. And she never said a word. But, anyway, more on that? 
JP: Yeah, well, that¡¯s a very good and rather notorious example. Clinton¡¯s war making is on the record, her destruction, and she was the lead destroyer of a modern state, Libya. And as a result of that destruction¨Cwhich she gloated, on camera, she gloated about the gruesome murder of Gaddafi¨Cin that destruction some 40,000 people died. Honduras, she was responsible for the coup against the democratically elected government. 
DB: They call her there the Deposer-in-Chief. 
JP: Yeah, yeah. And the idea that among certain liberal people that she represented some kind of honorable alternative to the verbose and unpredictable Donald Trump is so absurd. I think, again, I think all this is important because there will not be an opposition, there won¡¯t be an opposition to Trump, and there won¡¯t be an opposition to the great national security machine that really runs the United States. 
I mean, okay, he¡¯s anti-establishment, but that establishment isn¡¯t going anywhere. And, yes, he will bring in his own establishment. He¡¯s talking about defense secretary. Who is it? Senator Jeff Sessions, a Republican of Alabama. And national security advisors will have a hawkish edge: General Flynn and Representative Duncan Hunter of California, there. So all this is unknown. The point is, there was very little between Trump and Clinton. And what really distracted people, diverted people, from understanding this was what is unfortunately called, because there has to be [¡­] a better term, identity politics. 
Clinton was said to represent an advance for women. She¡¯s anything but. She¡¯s a diametric opposite of that. Clinton, the Democrats were meant to be an advance for people of color. Well, it was Clinton, the two Clintons, Bill and Hillary Clinton in the mid-90¡¯s, who devised the so-called welfare reforms that most historians, political historians, now agree was the trigger for sending so many African-Americans into the gulag that is America¡¯s prison system. 
So these, these have to be confronted because an opposition is going to be needed. At the present, there isn¡¯t one, in my opinion. There was never an opposition to Barack Obama, a violent president, who seduced the media. It¡¯s interesting that the more unpopular or that Donald Trump was made, with the media, and all of them were against him, all of them, bar some Murdock outlets, and others. But most media was against him. I think that helped to give him support. The media is held in such low regard by ordinary people. The so-called elites are held in such low regard by ordinary people. This is a class issue. There was a class issue running right through this campaign. And that has to be understood. 
DB: Indeed, that word class does not come up in the United States. We¡¯re the upwardly mobile society. Everybody can make it. 
JP: Well, it didn¡¯t. But it is, you know, that¡¯s what I mean by identity politics. Gender and race are separated from class. And it¡¯s not who you are, or what the color of your skin is, sometimes it is, perhaps often it is, but in the final analysis it¡¯s the power you serve. And that¡¯s class. And until the resistance to an intelligent understanding of that is swept aside, people are going to be mired in this, the distractions of identity politics. Where they don¡¯t feel any obligation, really, to find out. To find out about how the rest of humanity, how the rest of their compatriots in the United States live and what their problems are. It¡¯s all about ¡°me, me, me.¡± And until that is understood and discarded, discarded, and real feminism returns, not the kind represented by Hillary Clinton, real feminism, to take one major issue, then the Trumps will triumph.

DB: Real feminism? What do you mean by that John, real feminism? 
JP: Well, I mean feminism that is part of class. The feminism that understands that it¡¯s not just simply the privileges of bourgeois women. That¡¯s it not simply the privileges of the readers of the New York Times, and the Guardian in this country. It is the rights of women everywhere. It is the right of women to life, in places like Iraq, but are bombed by Americans. I think it was actually the New York Times source for this but one extraordinary statistic I read not long ago, there were 700,000 widows created since 2003. The last 13 years in Iraq, widows, women¡­ 
DB: 700,000¡­ 
JP: 700,000¡­ Now until those proclaiming themselves as feminists but keeping their feminism very parochial, very tight, and saying that a woman should be in the White House even if she¡¯s Hillary Clinton, I would suggest they consider that fact. Those women have a right too. And those deaths were caused by American policies. And, all I¡¯m saying is that the so-called identity, single issues have to stop being single issues. Feminism should be part of class, all the time. Because it¡¯s poor women who suffer most. And a lot of the people who voted for Trump were those women. I read that, is it 52% of white women voted for him? 
DB: Something like that, yeah. 
JP: Well, that has to be understood. Those women have rights too. 
DB: In a little bit, I want to talk more about the press. I¡¯m going to do that with you in the context of Jeff Sessions. Let¡¯s talk specifically about one huge foreign policy issue. How do you understand¡­ were you able to understand the difference between Clinton, Syria, Russia and Trump? You know, we know that the Clinton machine played Trump as a dupe of Putin, in Putin¡¯s pocket, the Russians sabotaged the election, that¡¯s what most people who were supporting Clinton probably now feel that Hillary would have won if the Russians didn¡¯t subvert. But the actual policies, what do you understand about that? 
JP: If they believe that, Dennis, then they suffer from, I¡¯ll be gentle, terminal naivet¨¦. I really want to say that they are stupid. Because it¡¯s really stupid to believe that. And it¡¯s been proven to be stupid: that it was all down to the Russians. I mean, for God¡¯s sake, what nonsense. You know? Those myths¡­ projected by the media, should be rejected, immediately. We have to learn to deconstruct and reject these propaganda messages that come out. But that one is a particularly obvious one. How could people believe such nonsense? I find that, actually, quite depressing. And I¡¯ve heard it from people. How could they believe such nonsense? That the Russians were actually on the side of Trump, he was in league with them, and all of that nonsense. 
What wasn¡¯t reported was there was a strand running through a lot of Trump¡¯s speeches that sounded to me like a kind of America first, what they used to call isolationist politics. We¡¯re going to deal with our people at home, we¡¯re not going to spend the treasure on overseas, and especially in going to war with countries. I mean, frankly, for those of us living outside the United States, who are not American, that¡¯s encouraging. I always find it remarkable that I¡¯ve got to this stage in life and that I haven¡¯t really¡­ and that I¡¯ve survived American foreign policy. 
So, Clinton was a very dangerous prospect. Trump may be a dangerous prospect too. We don¡¯t know. Will he do as he said, as he said in his acceptance, victory speech? We will have relationships, we will not have conflict with other countries, and all that. That could be just rhetoric. Trump is Mr. Rhetoric, so who knows? I think the most important thing is that an opposition is built, a genuine movement. Now, having been seduced and subverted by Obama, and largely by Clinton and others, there has to be a real oppositions in the streets. And it has to be informed. It can¡¯t accept these terrible myths. 
DB: Hillary Clinton, just to bring it to Syria for a moment, she was very strong on a no-fly zone. And it did appear that Trump was a little more interested in negotiating. What do you see the dangers of a no-fly zone? That, to me, was perhaps the most frightening part of what her policy could have been. 
JP: I don¡¯t know. I mean, he has said contradictory things on the Middle East. Very contradictory. He¡¯s been bellicose, in one sense. But in another, he¡¯s been¡­ a thread that has run through Trump¡¯s speeches, fairly consistent, and that is that he wants to do a deal with Russia. He doesn¡¯t want to fight them. 
It¡¯s ironic, because, as we speak¡­ and I read only the other day, hundreds of thousands of NATO troops, Americans, British, and others, in effect, massing on the borders of Russia. Now what will happen to them? What will happen to that provocation? That¡¯s a very, very dangerous provocation. Now, will Trump diffuse it? Will he step back? I don¡¯t know. 
It¡¯s interesting, he has spoken against NATO. In fact, for the Republican Convention Platform his people were asked to remove one issue, and that was that NATO would receive renewed shipments of weapons. And they were quite specific about removing that. That was pointed out to me by Professor Steven Cohen, who¡¯s been very interesting on this at New York University, and taken a lot of criticism for taking seriously, or at least analyzing some of the things that Trump has said over Russia. But, you know, we never know if he meant it. He¡¯s contradicted himself. So, now we¡¯re about to find out. 
DB: I¡¯m laughing a little bit because I think I¡¯m a little bit afraid of the potential, in terms of where this could go. I¡¯m not sure if I would be more frightened if Hillary was elected. A lot of people are furious with me for taking this perspective. But I, as you¡¯ve outlined, Iraq, Libya¡­ given the history, you know Honduras, Hillary Clinton, her hands are full of blood. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions donning one of Donald Trump¡¯s ¡°Make America Great Again¡± caps. 
JP: Dennis, it¡¯s an uninformed, and often the¡­ and often a willfully uninformed and ignorant fury that you¡¯re describing. It¡¯s a knee-jerk. You know we¡¯re in the age of the knee-jerk, of social media, knee-jerk, government by Facebook, war by media. It¡¯s an anti-intellectual time, not to think through. So the fury you describe, I would suggest, is almost a willfully ignorant one. Because what are we if we¡¯re not questioning, and what are we, if we¡¯re not pointing out that which the mob, as they used to call them in the 19 th century, disagrees with? 
DB: Now, let me sort of put Henry Kissinger and Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, as he¡¯s known inside Alabama, together in a question about the media. It was very interesting to me¡­ I mean I have investigated a number of church burnings, probably 30 or 40 that took place in Alabama when Jeff Sessions was the attorney general. Before that he was the U.S. attorney prosecuting phony voter fraud. 
But Jefferson Sessions is the pre-eminent racist. I was interested, everybody was upset about David Duke. Well, he¡¯s a frightening fellow, former Klan member. But it was Sessions who was the uptown Klan. He was one of the funders, he was one of the prosecutors of the same kinds of stuff that continue in terms of undermining people of color¡¯s rights to vote, and poor people¡¯s¡¯ rights to vote in this country. But the media, they were upset about Duke, but they don¡¯t know who Sessions is. 
JP: No, they don¡¯t know. Isn¡¯t that interesting? And Sessions is being considered, as I understand it, as Trump¡¯s Defense Secretary. 
DB: Well, for him, anything outside the border of Alabama is foreign policy. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaking to the AIPAC conference in Washington D.C. on March 21, 2016. (Photo credit: AIPAC) 
JP: Yeah. Now, if that¡¯s correct, then [¡­] how you¡¯ve described him, of course, it¡¯s worrying. This is a new situation, entirely new situation. And this is Trump now building a completely new, presidential establishment. But I do stress, that the so-called old establishment, the Pentagon, the intelligence, the NSA, the CIA, and all the rest of them, are going nowhere. They are the establishment. They will remain the establishment. 
Actually, Trump reminded us, in his acceptance speech that he had something like 200 generals and admirals¡­ I suppose there must be a lot of generals and admirals, former ones anyway hanging about. But he had 200 of them. Hillary had a lot of them because the Pentagon serving generals and admirals came out and demanded that Trump be beaten. Just as the CIA demanded that Trump be beaten. And the State Department demanded that Trump be beaten. He¡¯s building his own establishment but those¡­ the old establishment will remain as powerful as it¡¯s always been. 
What will give Trump power is the fact that he has both the houses in Congress, including many of his enemies in the Republican Party. And they also demanded that he be beaten. So that¡¯s a volatile situation. 
DB: Indeed it is. What about this? How do you see this sort of parallel structure that people talk about in terms of the relationship¡­ you mentioned it in the beginning of the interview, between the Brexit vote and Donald Trump? Is this sort of a parallel structure? 
JP: Yeah, I think it¡¯s related. And your first question, you know, was I surprised? Yes. Ah, no, I wasn¡¯t surprised that much, because of Brexit. I think we are at a stage in contemporary history where people almost feel like a Greek chorus, they can see and they are aware of what is happening, but they feel they can¡¯t do anything about it. I think that¡¯s widespread. 
And it doesn¡¯t only apply to working people. I think it applies, in the United States, of course, we go back to the issue of class. It certainly does apply to working class people, but it applies to many in the middle class which has been destroyed by these extreme neoliberal economic policies, in recent years. 
So, that¡¯s what happened here, in Brexit. I always felt that Brexit was a rebellion. It was a rebellion. It was people saying, ¡°We¡¯re fed up with these arrogant elites, taking away our basic rights, ignoring us, not hearing us.¡± And I think many people¡­it wasn¡¯t¡­ it was painted, of course, by the liberal class in Britain, as the result of a possibility of increased immigration. Yes, that was part of it. But it wasn¡¯t¡­ it was only part of it. (Photo by Luis Felipe Salas, 2009) 
It was about impoverished people, people losing the very underpinning of their security and the security for their families. And that¡¯s exactly true in the United States. You go to places like Kentucky where¡­ in those ravaged coal areas, where the life expectancy, I read recently is less than that of Ethiopia. Alright, that may be right at the end of the spectrum. But, you know, it applies to all the states that Trump won. Pennsylvania, particularly, Ohio, and others. 
Yeah, and that applied here in a different sense, but not really. It¡¯s about¡­ it¡¯s about a rebellion. In the United States, there is a vacuum on outside the establishment. I would say that both Clinton and Trump were extreme right-wing. That¡¯s how I would describe them. 
DB: Well, it was a riveting moment, I guess you could say, when I think it was in a debate with Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton evoked, as one of her key advisors, Henry Kissinger. 
JP: Yeah. 
DB: That was pretty extraordinary, right? 
JP: Yeah, well, you know as someone who should have been prosecuted a long time ago, has been wrong on practically everything anyway, I¡¯m not surprised. She is extreme right-wing. Trump is extreme Populist right-wing. And we¡¯re still to find out what that means. 
But my point is, that that, even in the center, in the social democratic space, in the former, going way back, Democratic Party space which now doesn¡¯t¡­ Democratic Party as far as a reforming party is long gone. But that doesn¡¯t exist. The United States has never had a Labor Party. They¡¯ve got a Labor Party, we¡¯ve got a Labor Party here, but that¡¯s been corrupted by our very own, although rather different in personality, Clinton-type character, Tony Blair. And all the others. That¡¯s been corrupted. 
And that¡­ in Britain, that has given rise to the extraordinary popularity of Jeremy Corbyn, who never wanted to be leader of the Labor Party, but was really swept up in it by a popular movement, that came straight from this disenchantment, this disaffection, this rejection of the political system. 
The same disaffection and disenchantment is in the United States. But who do people vote for? Who do people vote for? In comes Trump, trumpeting all the American stuff about, you know, I¡¯m a rich man, but I got rich because I knew how to do it, and you can too. Speaking this populist language. I don¡¯t think Sanders was ever a threat. And really Sanders is a disgrace. You know, his embrace of Clinton was so false some, to the point where Clinton could declare him as an ally. So he was never a threat. He joined, he joined up. 
DB: That was really troubling, and obviously, a lot of young people who supported Bernie Sanders, were profoundly troubled. And, I¡¯ve spoken to some of them, and they are furious, and they didn¡¯t show up for Hillary even though they had it drummed into their heads, things like, ¡°Even if it¡¯s just the vote on the Supreme Court, that alone is worth it.¡± The appointment of liberal judges. 
JP: Yeah. This is grasping for straws, really. And people have got to be, got to stop being disappointed. They¡¯ve got to be stopped being shocked. Stop being surprised. They¡¯ve got to understand why something happened. They¡¯ve got to inform themselves. And they¡¯ve got to be part of a real movement, a real oppositional movement. Nothing less than that will do now.   uncomfortably accepting the Nobel Peace Prize from Committee Chairman Thorbjorn Jagland in Oslo, Norway, Dec. 10, 2009. (White House photo) 
DB: John, you¡¯ve got a new film that¡¯s just coming out now, about to come out. Among other things, it¡¯s sort of a document that calls attention to the fact that the United States, under Barack Obama, has been engaged in a massive, and very dangerous nuclear buildup. This is in the context of Hillary Clinton being Secretary of State. So would you tell us a little bit about what you¡¯ve learned about Obama and about the film? 
JP: Yeah, not only¡­ well, it¡¯s about China as a target. At present¡­ and, Dennis, this is truly shocking, in the northern hemisphere, there is the biggest buildup of U.S. led NATO forces since World War II, confronting Russia. In the Asia-Pacific, there is the biggest buildup of U.S. Naval forces confronting China. This was not an issue. This was not an issue. It is truly something in the election campaign that we just had. And the¡­ you know, we¡¯re faced with so much provocation [that] has gone on, and that¡¯s what my film is about. It has to do with the Asia-Pacific. But the nuclear issue has returned. 
Under Obama, nuclear warhead construction and spending increased massively. It increased in spite of Obama¡¯s pledge in 2009 to help get rid of nuclear weapons. The opposite happened. There¡¯s something like a trillion dollars has been earmarked to be spent on nuclear weapons development in the coming years. Nuclear¡­ the whole nuclear issue is so urgent, it¡¯s so urgent because of this, these provocations against Russia, against China, both of them nuclear armed powers. China has reportedly changed its nuclear weapons policies to first strike, as a direct consequence of this pressure from the United States. Now what will happen to that? That¡¯s such an important question, because war and peace really should be at the top. If a kind of apocalyptic war broke out then all other issues are irrelevant. 
DB: We see this in the so-called U.S. Pacific Pivot, how dangerous this is getting. Again, because of idiotic U.S. press, all attention is on this so-called maniac in North Korea that we have to do something about. But I think the point here is that we¡¯ve got another¡­ when it comes to nuclear proliferation, and weapons, we¡¯ve got a maniac in the White House. 
JP: Well, yeah, that¡¯s it. And there¡¯s always been a maniac in the White House, I¡¯m afraid. And that¡¯s why I said recently I am always grateful that I¡¯m still here, that I haven¡¯t found myself witnessing my own demise in some nuclear apocalypse, that was the result of U.S. foreign policy. Our understanding of who¡¯s the maniac¡­ I don¡¯t think North Korea is a threat, really, to anybody, frankly. 
What North Korea wants is a peace. They want a peace treaty with the South. They want a peace treaty with the United States. They almost had it a while ago. That¡¯s what they want. And I don¡¯t think they¡¯re a threat. But they¡¯re exploited. With their recent test of, I think a nuclear missile, the U.S. has employed, or is about to employ these THAAD missile defense system. These are very aggressive. They got the word defense in there but they¡¯re very aggressive. A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptor is launched during a successful intercept test by the US Army, September 10, 2013. (Wikipedia) 
DB: And they¡¯re aimed, they¡¯re meant to be aimed, at China. 
JP: They¡¯re aimed at China. They¡¯re not aimed at North Korea, well maybe in the end, North Korea. But North Korea is regarded, really, contemptuously, as an oppositions of power. They¡¯re aimed at China. And China is being told now¨Cthis is from Clinton¡¯s speeches, that WikiLeaks released¨Caccording to Clinton, you know, the threat against China is that you control North Korea or we¡¯ll let you have some of their missiles, but they¡¯re all aimed at China. And when I was in Okinawa recently, there¡¯s no question, 400 ¨C 500 miles from China, that in the 132 U.S. bases on the island, they were all aimed at China. Now that is a massive, provocative situation. Will Trump dismantle it? Or will he appease it? Or will he use it? These are the questions. 
DB: These are big questions. And this may seem a little bit silly but I think it makes a lot of sense. In the midst of everybody talking about the crazy person in the north, we learn that Park, the current president, the daughter of the late and bitter dictator of South Korea has been¡­ one of her key advisors has been a seer. That she¡¯s been taking advice from somebody who has been essentially sort of a phony, if you will, a crystal ball reader who has the attention of the president. And so we find out that policy coming out of our allies in the south, with this huge massive military operation happening in Jeju and other places. She¡¯s taking orders¡­ people made fun of Nancy Reagan. 
JP: Yeah, well I¡¯m not surprised. I mean, South Korea is a colony. It¡¯s not an ally. It¡¯s an American colony. But it¡¯s a colony that, as a lot of colonies, can cause you a lot of trouble. The French found that with Algeria. And it¡¯s got potential for trouble. It could, you know, it could¡­ it has some very extreme people there, and they could start a war. But it is a colony. It has thirty odd thousand U.S. troops, bases all over it. And as you mentioned, it has this¡­ the South Koreans have built this new naval base on Jeju Island, with facilities for nuclear submarines, and Aegis missile destroyers and all the rest of it. 
So¡­ these places are flashpoints. They¡¯re flashpoints in¡­ almost in a war waiting to happen, or in a war that is being beckoned. During the old Cold War¨Cand I think we¡¯re in the second Cold War now¨Cduring the old Cold War, there were red lines, at least, [that] you didn¡¯t cross, there were spheres of influence. And you might probe but you didn¡¯t really cross the red lines marked down by the Soviet Union, and¡­which were mostly in Europe, to protect itself, of course. And the Soviets, although they supported liberation movements in the developing world, did not confront the Americans there. So there were these red lines. There are no red lines now. That¡¯s the difference. It¡¯s much more dangerous, now, in my opinion. 
DB: Well, and, you know, it¡¯s interesting I¡¯m on my way out to North Dakota, at Standing Rock, and where we see the Indigenous communities of North America trying to once again warn the genocidists of the United States government, how dangerous it is to be destroying the Earth, the water flow, not to mention destroying sacred burial grounds. We see, we¡¯ve got Bull Connor coming back, in the sense that we¡¯ve got dogs, an incredible, heavily armed force, brutally going after people who are resisting with their bodies, with their buffalo, with their beliefs. And the lines are drawn again. And no major candidate mentioned Standing Rock, I don¡¯t think. JP: Yeah. 
DB: Trump is invested, by the way. He¡¯s invested there. 
JP: None of these pressing issues were mentioned. That¡¯s why it¡¯s a very strange time. What is going to happen now? But, again I repeat, I think it¡¯s time for people to organize. There has to be an independent, an extra-parliamentary, if you like, opposition. An opposition, a movement of the streets, a movement among people having been shamed into silence almost, during the Obama years. People have got to come back now. 
DB: It¡¯s amazing how many smart people can be so stupid. I guess they are well schooled but they don¡¯t have any ability to understand foreign politics. I don¡¯t know. This country is desperate in that regard. How little the politicians know about the rest of the world. It¡¯s incredibly troubling. 
JP: Yeah, so in one sense it¡¯s up to us, in the broader sense of us. Not to believe the myths. Not to accept the propaganda, not to retreat in our own introspective worlds of me. But collectively to do something. 
DB: John, I left upstairs, all the background on your film. Could you remind us the name of the film and what¡¯s the schedule in terms of the distribution, and how people can pay attention? 
JP: Yeah. Well, my new film is called ¡°The Coming War on China.¡± And it will be broadcast on the ITV network in Britain, which is the biggest television network in Europe. It will be broadcast here [England] on the 6th of December. It will be released around the same time. As yet, we don¡¯t have a distributor in the United States, and it¡¯s always difficult but we¡¯re doing work on that. And it really is about the recurring theme in much of my work, and that is the imposition of great power on people, and their resistance to it. And it¡¯s very much, as I¡¯ve mentioned, about the renewal of the nuclear danger. But it traces the history of the abuse of people in order to achieve a nuclear supremacy. Part of the film is set in the Marshall Islands where between 1946 and 1958 the equivalent of more than one Hiroshima was exploded every day. People were guinea pigs.

Anti-Trump protests broke out shortly after the presidential results were in, but progressives need a more comprehensive and thoughtful approach to the next four years, says Sam Husseini. 
By Sam Husseini 
Two views seem to be dominant among progressives regarding Donald Trump: Either protest all he does (people have been holding ¡°anti-Trump¡± rallies for the past week) or ¡°give him a chance¡± (let¡¯s see what he does, maybe it will be okay). But both the demonizers and those urging a passive approach are wrong. 
The ¡°Anti-Trump¡± approach is hollow. First, to protest a person is dubious. Too often, ¡°progressives¡± have focused on the personal rather than the policies and actions. Remember ¡°Anybody But Bush¡±? That¡¯s not a particularly uplifting way of approaching things and doesn¡¯t lead to genuinely positive outcomes. Also, Trump is someone who has said a lot of contradictory things. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in an MSNBC interview. 
So, you can certainly talk about rights for immigrants or women¡¯s rights or ensuring that anti-Muslim policies do not escalate. But to say ¡°anti-Trump¡± or to ignore good things that Trump has said is hollow. And, yes, there are good things he¡¯s said. For example, during the primaries, he denounced the ¡°regime change¡± wars waged by George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: 
¡°We¡¯ve spent $4 trillion trying to topple various people that frankly, if they were there and if we could¡¯ve spent that $4 trillion in the United States to fix our roads, our bridges, and all of the other problems; our airports and all of the other problems we¡¯ve had, we would¡¯ve been a lot better off. I can tell you that right now.¡± 
But it also doesn¡¯t make sense to say ¡°let¡¯s see what he does.¡± To stand aside is to allow Trump to be cutting deals with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who will doubtlessly work to take away what populist, anti-interventionist and pro-working-class instincts Trump might otherwise follow. 
Bernie Sanders has in recent days struck a reasonable tone at times. In this interview and in a statement just after the election, he said: ¡°Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media. ¡­ To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him. To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him.¡± 
That seems like a reasonable approach although the major problem with what Sanders says is that it ignores foreign policy, a longstanding problem with Sanders. 
But others are addressing foreign policy: Rand Paul is right to press: ¡° Will Donald Trump betray voters by hiring John Bolton? ¡± Diana Johnston at CounterPunch wrote: ¡° After the Election: Don¡¯t Panic, Think! ¡± 
Left-Right Alliances 
One possible opportunity is for progressives to be forging left-right alliances , as Sanders alludes to above. Indeed, the senator¡¯s biographer, Greg Guma, notes that Sanders has done that in the past at times: Sen. Bernie Sanders speaking to one of his large crowds of supporters. (Photo credit: Sanders campaign) 
¡°One unusual aspect of Bernie¡¯s approach in Congress has been to wage congressional battles with people whose stands on other issues he abhors. In fact, much of Bernie¡¯s legislative success has come through forging deals with ideological opposites. An amendment to bar spending in support of defense contractor mergers, for example, was pushed through with the aid of Chris Smith, a prominent opponent of abortion. John Kasich ¡­ helped him phase out risk insurance for foreign investments. 
¡°And it was a ¡®left-right coalition¡¯ he helped create that derailed ¡®fast track¡¯ legislation on international agreements pushed by Bill Clinton. The power of that strategy may have reached its apex in May 2010 when Bernie¡¯s campaign to bring transparency to the Federal Reserve resulted in a 96-0 Senate vote on his amendment to audit the Fed and conduct a General Accounting Office audit of possible conflicts of interest in loans to unknown banks.¡± 
In fact, if such a right-left approach isn¡¯t followed now, Trump will likely be forging alliances with Ryan and McConnell . In other words, the path ahead for construction policies may be narrow, but it holds the best hope for the next four years. That strategy calls for attacking Trump when he fails his populist promises but working with him when he pursues them. 
This approach also would likely strengthen populist elements within the Democratic Party and may lead to a de facto realignment of U.S. politics. It may be less glamorous than resisting and filibustering, which may be needed on some issues, but finding constructive overlaps might actually fix some things that need fixing. 
Last year, in a piece entitled ¡° In Defence of the Rise of Trump ¡°, I wrote: 
¡°[Trump] might pursue the same old establishment policies if he were ever to get into office ¡ª that¡¯s largely what Obama has done, especially on foreign policy. Trump says, ¡®I was a member of the establishment seven months ago.¡¯ 
¡°The point is that the natives are restless. And they should be. It¡¯s an important time to engage them so they stay restless and funnel that energy to constructive use, not demonize or tune them out.¡± 
Demonizing Trump supporters has proved disastrous. It¡¯s time for another approach by progressives: engagement.

After Donald Trump¡¯s victory, Democrats and progressives have traded accusations as to what was at fault, the Establishment¡¯s insistence on Hillary Clinton or the insurgent challenges from Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein, reports Nat Parry. 
By Nat Parry 
As the reality of Donald J. Trump¡¯s victory in the Nov. 8 presidential election sets in, Democrats and progressives have been trading accusations over who ¨C or what ¨C may have led to this historic electoral defeat. 
For progressives who backed Vermont¡¯s independent Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primaries, the culprit is clearly the Democratic Party establishment, led by the likes of former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Shultz and current interim DNC chair Donna Brazile, who they blame for stacking the deck against their candidate and ensuring Hillary Clinton¡¯s nomination ¨C despite her considerable baggage heading into the election. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. (Photos by Gage Skidmore and derivative by Krassotkin, Wikipedia) 
These progressives point to Clinton¡¯s historically low favorability ratings in national polls, and the fact that in a hypothetical one-one-one match-up between Trump and Sanders, polling data showed early on that Sanders would have likely defeated Trump easily. Trump himself seemed to understand the advantage Sanders had over him in a possible general election contest, tweeting in May 2016 that he ¡°would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!¡± 
Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, Sanders was clearly more liked, even as Clinton wrapped up the nomination last summer. Gallup polling found in June 2016 that Sanders held 70 percent favorable and 18 percent unfavorable ratings among Democratic voters, while Clinton was seen favorably by 67 percent and unfavorably by 28 percent. In the aftermath of Trump¡¯s victory ¨C assisted by the lowest voter turnout in 20 years ¨C some have argued that enthusiasm for Sanders could have pushed the Democrats to victory in key swing states that ultimately went to Trump. 
To back up these claims, the progressive website USUncut pointed out on Nov. 10 that in five states that Sanders won in the primaries ¨C Indiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wisconsin ¨C the exit polling data indicated that the demographic groups that helped Trump reach 270 electoral college votes were also Sanders¡¯s key demographics. 
¡°Assuming that Sanders won white, rural rust belt voters in the traditionally blue states that Hillary Clinton lost,¡± Sanders would have won the Electoral College with a 303-235 advantage , according to this analysis. 
Yet, while progressives blame the Democratic establishment for pushing an unpopular nominee ¨C who was saddled by a federal investigation into her use of a private email server while Secretary of State, questions related to the ethics of her collecting sizable speaking fees from Wall Street firms, and suspicions over the Clinton Foundation¡¯s dealings with foreign governments ¨C establishment Democrats have been largely placing the blame on progressives for failing to unite behind Clinton. 
Some commentators have pointed fingers at voters who decided to buck the two-party system and cast a ballot for the Green Party¡¯s Jill Stein or the Libertarian Party¡¯s Gary Johnson while others have assigned blame to Sanders for daring to mount a primary challenge against Clinton in the first place. 
This was the argument of Prof. Gil Troy, who wrote at Time Magazine on Nov. 14 that ¡°Senator Bernie Sanders earned the 2016 ¡®Ralph Nader Award¡¯ for the Leftist Most Responsible for Helping Republicans Win the Presidency.¡± 
While acknowledging that Trump ¡°cleverly exploited voters¡¯ frustrations¡± and that ¡°Clinton¡¯s campaign in 2016 was as rigid and empty as it was when she lost in 2008,¡± Troy nevertheless argues that Sanders¡¯ insurgent primary campaign ¡°pushed her too far left to prevent an effective re-centering in the fall.¡± 
Troy offers few facts or polling data to back up these claims, instead making broad-based assertions such as ¡°just as Ralph Nader siphoned tens of thousands of votes on Election Day 2000 in Florida from Al Gore, causing the deadlock and George W. Bush¡¯s victory, Bernie Sanders¡¯ similar vampire effect enfeebled Hillary Clinton.¡± 
According to this view, even running a progressive primary election challenge ¨C much less a third-party campaign ¨C is dangerously unacceptable, creating a so-called ¡°vampire effect¡± that ¡°siphons votes¡± that rightfully belong to someone else. 
The Spoiler Effect 
While Sanders remains the target of some criticism for costing the Democrats the election, the real vitriol is leveled at third parties and their supporters. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida. 
Typical was the reaction of Newsweek senior writer Kurt Eichenwald, who published an account of an encounter he had with a fan in the Philadelphia International Airport following the election. The individual had approached Eichenwald to praise his work but nearly ended up the victim of a physical assault. 
According to Eichenwald, the man, who had recognized the pundit from his television appearances, thanked him for his reporting on Trump and expressed disgust that Trump had won. Eichenwald then asked the fan who he had voted for. The man stated that he voted for Green Party nominee Jill Stein, to which Eichenwald replied: ¡°You¡¯re lucky it¡¯s illegal for me to punch you in the face.¡± According to his account of the interaction, Eichenwald then told his fan to go ¡°have sex with himself.¡± 
As anyone who has ever voted for a party other than the Democrats or Republicans can attest, this is a pretty familiar reaction. In the United States¡¯ winner-take-all electoral system, a vote for anyone outside of the two main parties is seen as a ¡°wasted vote¡± that could ¡°spoil¡± the election, and those who make this decision risk professional and social ostracism. 
In this system, third-party voters are vilified to an extent not seen for any other voting demographic ¨C including nonvoters who in fact account for a far greater share of the electorate, and therefore have a much bigger effect in swinging the election. 
Yet, this has not stopped many pundits and social media users from piling blame onto supporters of Stein or Johnson, who are deemed reckless and irresponsible for so frivolously casting a ballot for candidates who had no chance of winning ¨C or worse yet, as personally culpable for Trump¡¯s victory and all the disastrous policies that might follow. 
¡°If you vote for somebody who can¡¯t win for president, it means that you don¡¯t care who wins for president,¡± opined MSNBC¡¯s Rachel Maddow on Election Night. She later elaborated on this wasted-vote theory, tweeting about a fanciful scenario in which every Stein vote and half of Johnson¡¯s votes would have gone to Clinton, who might have then claimed enough states from Trump to eke out an Electoral College win, a story repeated by CNN . 
In a similar vein, columnist Paul Krugman weighed in by tweeting in the early morning hours of Nov. 9 that ¡°Jill Stein has managed to play Ralph Nader,¡± referring to the ¡°spoiler effect¡± that the 2000 Green Party nominee allegedly had on the election 16 years ago. ¡°Without her Florida might have been saved.¡± 
Flawed Analysis 
Setting aside rehashed arguments from 2000, when it comes to Election 2016 independent evaluations of third-party voting have concluded that the effect of this voting bloc was statistically negligible, and cannot seriously be attributed to Clinton¡¯s defeat. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 
A Wall Street Journal analysis, for example, found that Clinton would have needed to win 70 percent of the vote share that went to both the Libertarian and Green parties across eight swing states to claim victory ¨C a highly unlikely scenario considering that the Libertarian Party champions a brand of fiscal conservatism and limited government that traditionally appeals to right-leaning, Republican voters. (Indeed, the 2016 Libertarian Party ticket was headed by two former Republican governors: Gary Johnson of New Mexico and Bill Weld of Massachusetts.) 
In another analysis, the Washington Post concluded that in the five states Trump won by a margin smaller than the combined Johnson/Stein vote, some of them could have been flipped if the entire Stein vote was added to Clinton¡¯s total. In this scenario, the Post notes, the outcome might have changed in Michigan and Wisconsin, still however leaving her short of an Electoral College victory. 
The paper pointed out however that ¡°this projection rests on the unrealistic assumption that all Stein voters would have voted for Clinton,¡± conceding that it is impossible to ¡°know how Johnson and Stein backers would have voted if forced to choose between Clinton, Trump and staying home.¡± More realistically, many would have ¡°skipped the presidential race or voted for another candidate .¡± 
Besides the lack of hard statistical data to back up the wasted vote/spoiler effect claims, they also rest on a flawed assumption that anyone¡¯s votes ¨C whether Clinton¡¯s, Trump¡¯s, Johnson¡¯s or Stein¡¯s ¨C actually belong to anyone else. In fact, many third-party voters are simply fed up with the system itself, and hope that by voting for other options, it might be possible to someday build up viable alternatives to the two-party system. 
This was especially the case this year, in which the numbers of disaffected voters reached historic proportions. By the time the primaries had been decided last summer, in fact, the two front-runners were the most unpopular candidates seen in a generation, which should have been seen as a warning sign to Democrats who traditionally rely on high voter turnout for electoral success. 
According to a Quinnipiac poll released in June, Clinton had a 57 percent unfavorability rating, while Trump received a 59 percent unfavorability rating. Moreover, according to a survey by Data Targeting, 55 percent of Americans favored having an independent or third-party presidential candidate to consider. Among millennials ¨C a key demographic for Barack Obama¡¯s victories in 2008 and 2012 ¨C 91 percent expressed support for additional choices this year. 
Another poll, released in September just before the Trump-Clinton debates began, found that 76 percent of Americans favored Johnson and Stein sharing the stage with the two main party candidates in the debates. This, of course, did not happen, with the Commission on Presidential Debates sticking to its strict criteria that independents and third parties need to reach 15 percent in national polling before they are allowed into the debates. 
This is perhaps one reason why Americans remained largely ignorant of Stein¡¯s and Johnson¡¯s campaigns, with Gallup finding that 63 percent were unfamiliar with Johnson heading into the general election, and 68 percent were unfamiliar with Stein. 
Voter Boycotts and Voter Suppression 
Regardless of the impacts of third-party alternatives ¨C which only ended up receiving a total of 4 percent of the popular vote ¨C the deep disaffection among American voters that was seen in earlier polling seemed to manifest itself in other voting trends on Election Day. This disaffection can be seen in the high number of down-ballot voters who opted not to cast a ballot for president this year. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. 
One telling analysis found that in 14 states, down-ballot candidates received more votes than presidential candidates. 
In North Carolina, for instance, about 30,000 more people cast ballots for incumbent Gov. Pat McCrory and Roy Cooper than for any of the presidential nominees. In Vermont, about 314,000 voters cast ballots in the governor¡¯s race, and 313,000 for the Senate, while just 291,000 voted for president ¨C a difference of almost 8 percent. 
In Oregon, where Democrats Sen. Ron Wyden and Gov. Kate Brown easily won re-election, their races drew about 75,000 more votes than the presidential contest. Other states in which down-ballot voters essentially boycotted the presidential election included Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and West Virginia. 
Besides nonvoters, another factor that should be receiving at least as much attention as third-party ¡°spoilers¡± are the would-be voters who could not cast a ballot due to systematic disenfranchisement, possible voter suppression or other all-too-familiar problems at polling places. As the Brennan Center for Justice noted on Nov. 14, ¡°too many voters had to contend with long lines, malfunctioning voting machines, confusion over voting restrictions, voter intimidation, [and] voter registration problems.¡± 
The nonpartisan law and policy institute, which has been documenting flaws in U.S. election administration for years, notes that ¡°2016 was not the first election in which these problems have occurred ¨C and that itself is a problem.¡± 
Describing numerous instances of voting problems across the country, the group concluded that ¡°the ways in which elections are administered, including how well they are resourced, can have a negative impact on citizens¡¯ ability to cast a ballot and the confidence the public has in the system.¡± 
Investigative reporter Greg Palast went further than that, contending that ¡°before a single vote was cast, the election was fixed by GOP and Trump operatives.¡± 
He noted in a Nov. 11 blog post that in 2013, just as the Supreme Court overturned key sections of the Voting Rights Act, Republican operatives created a system called Crosscheck to purge 1.1 million Americans from the voter rolls of Republican-controlled states. 
According to his count, in Michigan, the Crosscheck purge list eliminated 449,922 voters from the rolls, while Trump claimed victory in that state by just 13,107 votes. In Arizona, the Trump victory margin was 85,257 votes, while a total of 270,824 voters were eliminated by Crosscheck. The Trump victory margin in North Carolina was 177,008, while the Crosscheck purge list accounted for 589,393 voters knocked off the rolls. 
Palast notes that ¡°the electoral putsch was aided by nine other methods of attacking the right to vote of Black, Latino and Asian-American voters ¡­ including ¡®caging,¡¯ ¡®purging,¡¯ blocking legitimate registrations, and wrongly shunting millions to ¡®provisional¡¯ ballots that will never be counted.¡± 
He also points to the discrepancies between the exit polling data and the final results in several battleground states, noting that exit polling is historically ¡°deadly accurate.¡± Despite this, Palast notes that in 2016, the exit polling was off the mark in at least four key swing states. 
According to the exit polls, Clinton should have won Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but at the end of the day all of these states went to Trump. Accounting for a total of 74 Electoral College votes, these four states would have been more than enough for Clinton to have flipped the election. 
And of course, this all assumes that the Electoral College is legitimate in the first place. The fact remains that Hillary Clinton received more than one million more votes nationwide than Donald Trump, and the only reason he is assuming the White House is due to the arcane and controversial system of allocating votes through the Electoral College. 
This has led to increasing calls to abolish the Electoral College altogether based on the idea that elections should be determined on the principle of one person, one vote. 
Needed Reforms Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson. 
Needless to say, to many around the world ¨C not to mention many within the United States ¨C these elections are looking less like free expressions of the people¡¯s will than they do down-and-dirty slug fests in which either side is willing to claim a victory at any cost. 
This election was observed by two international organizations in fact, and while their final reports vary to considerable degrees, both the Organization of American States and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe both criticized the tone of the election and highlighted numerous structural deficiencies in the way the United States chooses its leaders. 
The OAS final report identified the following issues as representing key areas for improvement in the U.S. electoral system: taking measures to avoid long lines at polling places, broadening cooperation between states to compare information and avoid possible duplications in voter registries, expanding the practice of redistricting through nonpartisan commissions, addressing the impacts of the Supreme Court¡¯s decision to eliminate parts of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, establishing better campaign finance rules, and jettisoning the divisive campaign rhetoric that has turned off so many voters from the process. 
The OAS also noted the unusual practice in the United States of simultaneously mandating voter identification while not providing this required identification to eligible voters. 
¡°Practically all countries in the region provide at least one free form of national identification to their citizens, which is used for electoral purposes,¡± said the OAS . ¡°In the U.S., 32 states currently have laws in force that require voters to show some form of prescribed identification to verify their identity before casting a vote.¡± However, these states do not make this identification readily available to citizens, contrary to good electoral practice. 
This is also a weakness that the OSCE pointed out in its report , noting: ¡°Voter identification rules are politically divisive and vary across the states, with 32 states requiring photo identification. A high volume of litigation regarding voter identification continued up to Election Day, generating confusion among voters and election officials regarding the application of rules. Efforts to ensure the integrity of the vote are important, but should not lead to the disenfranchisement of eligible voters.¡± 
The 57-country organization also noted the undue obstacles faced by minor parties and independents trying to compete in U.S. elections. 
¡°The number of signatures required and the signature submission deadlines vary from state to state, which made it cumbersome for third party or independent candidates to register across all states for presidential elections,¡± the OSCE pointed out. ¡°Both the Green Party and Libertarian Party challenged ballot access requirements in several states, with success in a few instances.¡± 
The organization, which has been monitoring elections in the United States since 2004, regretted that since previous election observation missions, a number of its ¡°priority recommendations remain unaddressed.¡± It pointed out that ¡°deficiencies in the legal framework persist, such as the disenfranchisement of citizens living in various territories, restrictions on the voting rights of convicted criminals and infringements on secrecy of the ballot.¡± 
Rather than focusing on who is to blame for Trump¡¯s victory in Election 2016, Democrats, Republicans, progressives, independent conservatives, third-party supporters, minorities, and good-government groups might be better served coming together and finally taking seriously the task of electoral reform, beginning with addressing some of the key recommendations of impartial international observers. 
Perhaps then, this perennial debate and the endless exchange of recriminations might finally come to an end.

An early test of whether President Trump will bow to Israel¡¯s political clout may come over the Iran nuclear agreement which Prime Minister Netanyahu wants killed, as ex-CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar describes. 
By Paul R. Pillar 
Among the foreign policy issues on which Donald Trump took a simple anti-Obama, or anti-Clinton, stance during the campaign but about which he had not seemed to have devoted much thought, one of the most prominent and important is the agreement that restricts Iran¡¯s nuclear program, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA. 
When the new president does get a chance to give the subject more attention, he will see that opposition to the agreement is primarily a matter of old political baggage. If he does not want to be burdened with such baggage and desires instead to set his own course, he will build on the agreement rather than succumb to the pressures of those who would like to kill it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the United Nations in 2012, drawing his own ¡°red line¡± on how far he will let Iran go in refining nuclear fuel. 
The baggage has had two parts. One has been the effort by President Obama¡¯s political opposition to deny him any major achievements ¡ª applicable to the JCPOA in that it has been one of the President¡¯s most significant foreign policy achievements. Even viewed through a crass partisan political lens, this motivation will get more out of date with each day that goes by after Mr. Obama leaves office. 
The other part has been opposition of the Netanyahu government in Israel, with all the usual implications of how that government¡¯s postures affect U.S. politics and how the Iran issue has thus been treated as if it were an Israel issue. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu¡¯s opposition has been motivated by the objectives of keeping a regional rival to Israel isolated forever, portraying Iran as the root of all problems in the Middle East, distracting attention from problems that involve Israel and its policies, and keeping U.S. diplomacy and cooperative measures in the Middle East confined to Israel or channels approved by Israel. 
This opposition was maintained even though the agreement that has precluded an Iranian nuclear weapon is very much in the interests of Israel¡¯s security, as testified to by the large majority of senior Israeli security officials and former officials who have been free to discuss the topic. 
A Success 
The JCPOA is a success. It has been fully working for well over a year. It has blocked all possible avenues to an Iranian nuclear weapon. Iran has been complying with its extensive obligations under the agreement, as certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Those opponents who have stretched to accuse Iran of violations have been doing exactly that: stretching. Iran¡¯s President Hassan Rouhani celebrates the completion of an interim deal on Iran¡¯s nuclear program on Nov. 24, 2013, by kissing the head of the daughter of an assassinated Iranian nuclear engineer. (Iranian government photo) 
Regarding recent accusations regarding Iranian production of heavy water, for example, the agreement does not prohibit Iran from ever exceeding a specified limit of 130 metric tons. Instead, the JCPOA requires Iran to make any excess available for export ¡ª which is exactly what Iran has done. 
For the new U.S. administration to withdraw from the JCPOA ¡ª either explicitly by declaring so, or through sanctions policies that would violate the agreement ¡ª would clearly be a big mistake. To begin with, any such unilateral move by the United States would run up against the fact that this agreement involves not only Iran and the United States but also five other parties, including major Western allies as well as Russia and China. 
The European allies have made quite clear that they are committed to the agreement. U.S. abrogation would not only involve problems with them but also would upset any early efforts by President Trump to develop more cooperative relations with Russia. 
A U.S. withdrawal could lead Iran to react in either of two ways, each of which would be disadvantageous to U.S. interests. If the Iranians judged the U.S. part of the economic and sanctions provisions of the JCPOA to be too large to overlook, they would declare ¡ª as they would be entitled to ¡ª that the entire agreement was null and void. This would mean Iran would be freed from all the nuclear limitations in the agreement. 
The Iranians could spin as many centrifuges, stockpile as much highly enriched uranium, and build as many plutonium-producing reactors as they want. (And forget the notion of negotiating a ¡°better deal¡± ¡ª that was never a possibility with an agreement that was laboriously negotiated and that was barely politically acceptable in Iran.) 
A Boon for U.S. Rivals 
Alternatively, the Iranians might say that it considered the agreement still to be in force with all the parties other than the United States. This would mean the Europeans getting business deals such as large sales of commercial airliners rather than American companies like Boeing getting the business, and it would mean Russia and China getting both commercial deals and diplomatic influence that the United States would not be getting. This would be a situation that Donald Trump himself said during the campaign was unacceptable. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaking to the AIPAC conference in Washington D.C. on March 21, 2016. (Photo credit: AIPAC) 
Withdrawal from the JCPOA would have additional, farther-reaching negative implications for President Trump. It would re-open an old issue that had been resolved through diplomacy, create a new crisis, and consume much high-level time and attention that otherwise could be devoted to countless other foreign policy problems, including ones centered in the Middle East. 
Withdrawal also would weaken the credibility of anything else the new U.S. president wants to do that involves, like the JCPOA, executive action rather than a treaty. Much of what Mr. Trump has talked about regarding trade and other matters falls into this category. 
Not least important, backing away from the JCPOA would kill opportunities to build on the agreement by doing diplomatic business with Iran on many important issues where Iran is unavoidably a major player. An excellent guide to those opportunities is a just-released report titled Maximizing the Opening with Iran: How President Trump Can Secure American Interests in the Middle East , prepared by the National Iranian American Council (NIAC) and signed by 76 national security experts and scholars (including myself). The report states, ¡°If diplomacy could be successful in resolving the most volatile and complex point of tension between the U.S. and Iran ¨C the nuclear dispute ¨C President Trump should also employ diplomacy to peacefully resolve or manage the remaining differences between Washington and Tehran.¡± 
It¡¯s not just bilateral issues and remaining differences in the U.S.-Iranian relationship that are at stake. It is the ability of the United States to address effectively many other problems important to it. In the words of the NIAC report, ¡°Iran has substantial latent power ¨C population size and potential for wealth generation ¨C and thus it is bound to be a leading power in the greater Middle East. Washington cannot change this. Nor can Washington stabilize the Middle East without Iran¡¯s involvement. Iran will be part of the regional solution ¨C or there won¡¯t be a solution.¡± 
The report includes many specific recommendations regarding problems ranging from warfare in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan to energy and security in the Persian Gulf. 
The JCPOA is important not just because of the technical details of what goes on inside Iranian nuclear facilities, although the nuclear nonproliferation objectives that the accord has advanced are indeed very important. It is important also as a step away from the self-hamstringing American habit of not fully using available diplomatic tools to pursue U.S. interests, because of a distaste for dealing with regimes we don¡¯t happen to like. Making America great on the world stage requires getting rid of that habit.

An ugly side of Donald Trump¡¯s victory has been the unleashing of bigotry against minorities and women with the President-elect only mildly reining in these belligerent followers, writes Michael Winship. 
By Michael Winship 
A friend of mine who has dual Israeli-American citizenship tells the story of entering an elevator in Jerusalem shortly after a bullying right-wing government had taken over the country. The other passenger was ostentatiously puffing on a big cigar. My friend pointed to the no smoking sign and politely, in Hebrew, asked the man to douse his smoke. 
¡°Eff you,¡± the man replied. ¡°We¡¯re in charge now.¡± Only he didn¡¯t say, ¡°Eff.¡± The Confederate battle flag, seen by many around the world as a symbol of white supremacy, has had a resurgence in public displays following Donald Trump¡¯s victory. 
Sound familiar? Well, it¡¯s a tiptoe through the tulips compared to what¡¯s going on in the United States right now. Incidents of hate-related violence and other abuses have proliferated throughout this lovely land of ours. 
The presidential campaign and now the election results have further allowed the pinheads of society to let their racist, misogynistic, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic freak flags fly. Despite denials from many on the Right and the Trump transition team, this is really happening ¡ª unlike that avalanche of fake news stories that have been overwhelming social media. (And yes, I know have been scattered incidents in which Trump followers have been vilified on the streets, but far fewer.) 
Journalists who investigated Trump, his businesses, family and associates have been mailed anti-Semitic screeds or threatened with violence and even death. Women who have reported on Trump have been sent the vilest sexist epithets. Kshama Sawant, the socialist city council member from Seattle who recently urged protests at Trump¡¯s inauguration in January, has been targeted for email and phone attacks, some of which have suggested that she kill herself. 
Just about everyone I know has a story or two or three from the last week and a half. My friend Deana tells of a part-Asian co-worker swung at by a white male who mistook him as being from the Middle East, of a friend¡¯s boyfriend who was told to ¡°Go back to Africa¡± on his Facebook page, of another friend¡¯s middle-school-aged daughter and other girls who were pushed around by boys in her class, some wearing Trump T-shirts and shouting hateful things about women. 
An Upsurge in Ugliness

A new report from the FBI states that last year, hate crimes were up 6 percent, with a two-thirds increase in attacks against Muslims. According to their statistics, ¡°There were 5,818 single-bias incidents involving 7,121 victims. Of those victims, 59.2 percent were targeted because of a race/ethnicity/ancestry bias; 19.7 percent because of a religious bias; 17.7 percent because of a sexual-orientation bias; 1.7 percent because of a gender-identity bias; 1.2 percent because of a disability bias; and 0.4 percent because of a gender bias.¡± 
Camila Domonosket at NPR notes, ¡°The FBI report is based on local law enforcement data. It almost certainly understates the scale of the problem: In 2014, the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated, based on victim surveys, that 60 percent of hate crimes are never reported to police.¡± 
Here in New York City, the police department reports that so far in 2016 , hate crimes have jumped 30 percent from the same period last year, ¡°including a spike during last week¡¯s hotly contested presidential election,¡± according to DNAInfo New York . ¡°NYPD statistics show that anti-Muslim and anti-¡®sexual orientation¡¯ motivations were responsible for much of the rise.¡± 
But what was Donald Trump¡¯s response to the reports of the upswing in hate crimes after his election? ¡°I am very surprised to hear that,¡± he told 60 Minutes¡¯ Lesley Stahl . ¡°I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that.¡± 
Lesley Stahl: But you do hear it? 
Donald Trump: I don¡¯t hear it ¡ª I saw, I saw one or two instances¡­ 
Lesley Stahl: On social media? 
Donald Trump: But I think it¡¯s a very small amount. Again, I think it¡¯s ¡ª 
Lesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people? 
Donald Trump: I would say don¡¯t do it, that¡¯s terrible, ¡®cause I¡¯m gonna bring this country together. 
Lesley Stahl: They¡¯re harassing Latinos, Muslims ¡ª 
Donald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, ¡°Stop it.¡± If it ¡ª if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it. 
¡°Stop it.¡± Really? That¡¯s all? You sounded like a parent telling the kids in the back seat to quit fidgeting. Make your condemnation swift, adamant and loud. We know you know how to do loud. Demand that it cease. 
The Bannon Factor 
And while we¡¯re at it, Mr. President-elect, the appointment of your campaign CEO Steve Bannon as counselor and chief White House strategist makes a hideous situation even worse. Cancel it. Steve Bannon, political adviser to   Trump. (Photo from YouTube) 
This is, after all, the person who ¡ª more than a year ago! ¡ª Joshua Green at Bloomberg BusinessWeek succinctly described as ¡°the most dangerous political operative in America.¡± 
Julia Zorthian at TIME magazine writes that as head of the alt-right news website Breitbart , ¡°Bannon has given voice to some of the unsavory forces floating around the conservative movement¡¯s fringe, including a resurgence of white nationalism. His appointment has fueled anger , with critics decrying Bannon¡¯s connections to racist and anti-Semitic views.¡± 
In recent days, many of you have seen some of Breibart ¡¯s headlines: ¡°Bill Kristol: Republican spoiler, renegade Jew,¡± ¡°Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy,¡± ¡°Would you rather your child had feminism or cancer?¡± and ¡°Gay rights have made us dumber, it¡¯s time to get back in the closet.¡± 
Even The Washington Post¡¯ s Kathleen Parker, who cut Bannon some slack in a recent column , concluded that ¡°he has been willing to strategically encourage people¡¯s hate as a way of inciting them to action. How these methods will manifest themselves in the White House remains to be seen. But we can uncomfortably imagine that Trump under Bannon¡¯s direction will do whatever it takes to get what he wants.¡± Swell. 
So hate speech and Steve Bannon: a perfect pair. Donald Trump, you¡¯ve let this evil genie out of the bottle. Set an example for a country so viciously torn asunder. Use one of your two remaining wishes and end this madness.

Rust Belt voters turned to Donald Trump in hopes he could reindustrialize the U.S., but the President-elect¡¯s plans could encounter major financial and geopolitical obstacles, says ex-British diplomat Alastair Crooke. 
By Alastair Crooke 
We are plainly at a pivotal moment. President-Elect Trump wants to make dramatic changes in his nation¡¯s course. His battle cry of wanting to make ¡°America Great Again¡± evokes ¨C and almost certainly is intended to evoke ¨C the epic American economic expansions of the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries. 
Trump wants to reverse the off-shoring of American jobs; he wants to revive America¡¯s manufacturing base; he wants to recast the terms of international trade; he wants growth; and he wants jobs in the U.S. ¨C and he wants to turn America¡¯s foreign policy around 180 degrees. The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads ¡°Vote Trump¡± on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr) 
It is an agenda that is, as it were, quite laudable. Many Americans want just this, and the transition in which we are presently in ¨C dictated by the global elusiveness and search for growth (whatever is meant now by this term ¡°growth¡±), clearly requires a different economic approach from that followed in recent decades. 
As Ra¨²l Ilargi Meijer has perceptively posited , greater self-reliance ¡°is the future of the world, ¡®post-growth¡¯, and post-globalization. Every country, and every society, needs to focus on self-reliance, not as some idealistic luxury choice, but as a necessity. And that is not as bad or terrible as people would have you believe, and it¡¯s not the end of the world ¡­ It is not an idealistic transition towards self-sufficiency, it¡¯s simply and inevitably what¡¯s left, once unfettered growth hits the skids. ¡­ 
¡°Our entire world views and ¡®philosophies¡¯ are based on ever more and ever bigger and then some, and our entire economies are built upon it. That has already made us ignore the decline of our real markets for many years now . We focus on data about stock markets and the like, and ignore the demise of our respective heartlands, and flyover countries ¡­ 
¡°Donald Trump looks very much like the ideal fit for this transition ¡­ What matters [here] is that he promises to bring back jobs to America, and that¡¯s what the country needs ¡­ Not so they can then export their products, but to consume them at home, and sell them in the domestic market ¡­There¡¯s nothing wrong or negative with an American buying products made in America instead of in China. 
¡°There¡¯s nothing economically ¨C let alone morally ¨C wrong with people producing what they and their families and close neighbours themselves want, and need, without hauling it halfway around the world for a meagre profit. At least not for the man in the street. It¡¯s not a threat to our ¡®open societies¡¯, as many claim. That openness does not depend on having things shipped to your stores over 1000s of miles, that you could have made yourselves, at a potentially huge benefit to your local economy. An ¡®open society¡¯ is a state of mind, be it collective or personal. It¡¯s not something that¡¯s for sale.¡± 
A Great Wish 
That¡¯s Trump¡¯s ostensible great wish, (it seems). It is not an unworthy one, but things have changed: America is no longer what it was in the Nineteenth or Twentieth centuries, neither in terms of untapped natural resources, nor societally. And nor is the rest of the world the same either. 
Mr. Trump rather unfortunately may find that his chief task will not be the management of this Great Re-orientation, but more prosaically, fending off the headwinds which he will face as he hauls on the tiller of the economy. 
In short, there is a real prospect that his ambitious economic ¡°remake¡± may well be prematurely punctured by financial crisis. 
These headwinds will not be of his making, and for the main part, they lie beyond human agency per se . They are structural, and they are multiple. They represent the accumulation of an earlier monetary doctrine which will fetter the President-elect into a small corner from which any chosen exit will carry adverse implications. 
Ditto for anyone else trying to steer any ship of state in this contemporary global economy. Paradoxically ¨C in an era moving toward greater self-sufficiency ¨C what success Trump may have, however, will likely depend not on self-reliance so much as he would like. 
For his foreign policy about turn, he will depend on finding common interest with Russian President Vladimir Putin (that should not be too hard) ¨C and for the economic ¡°about turn¡± ¨C on Trump¡¯s ability not to confront China, but to come to some modus vivendi with President Xi (less easy). 
¡°Things are not what they were.¡± Complexity ¡°theory¡± tells us that trying to repeat what worked earlier ¨C in very different conditions ¨C will likely not work if repeated later. In the Clinton era, for example, 85 percent of the U.S. population growth derived from the working-age population. The headwind that Trump will face is that, over the next eight years, 80 percent of the population growth will comprise 65+ year olds . And 65+ year olds are not a good engine of economic growth. This is not an uniquely American problem; it is a global trend too. 
¡°The peak growth¡± (according to Econimica blog), ¡°in the annual combined working age population (15-64 year/olds) among all the 35 wealthy OECD nations, China, Brazil, and Russia has collapsed since its 1981 peak. The annual growth in the working age population among these nations has fallen from +29 million a year to just +1 million in 2016 ¡­ but from here on, the working age population will be declining every year ¡­ These nations make up almost three quarters of all global demand for oil and exports in general. But their combined working age populations will shrink every year, from here on (surely for decades and perhaps far longer). Global demand for nearly everything is set to suffer. ¡± (FFR stands for Federal Funds Rate: i.e. the US key interest rate) Source: http://econimica.blogspot.it/2016/11/trump-lies-no-different-than-obama-or.html 
And then there is China : It too is passing through a difficult ¡°transition¡± from the old economy to an ¡°innovative¡± one. It too, has an aging population and a debt problem (with a debt-to-gross domestic ratio reaching 247 percent). Trump argues that China deliberately holds down the value of its currency to gain unfair trade advantage, and he further suggests that he intends to confront the Chinese government on this key issue. 
Again, Trump does have a point (many nations are managing their exchange rates precisely in order to try to ¡°steal¡± a little bit extra growth from the diminished global pot). But as noted at Zerohedge, citing the analysis of One River Asset Management executive Eric Peters: 
¡°What¡¯s good for the US in this case [the rising dollar and interest rates in anticipation of ¡®Trumponomics¡¯], is not good for emerging markets (EMs). Emerging markets benefit from a weaker dollar, and you¡¯re not going to get that. Emerging markets benefit from global capital flows moving in their direction and that¡¯s not happening either. Back in February, emerging markets were in sharp decline, driven by (1) a strong dollar, (2) rising US interest rates, and (3) slowing Chinese growth. Then China spurred a massive credit stimulus, the Fed became wildly dovish, and the dollar declined sharply. 
¡°Interest rates collapsed throughout the year. As the growing pool of dollar, euro and yen liquidity searched for a decent return, it headed to emerging markets. Trump has reignited the dollar rally, and his fiscal stimulus will force interest rates higher. This reversed everything. [the dollars are heading home] 
¡°And to be sure, the Beijing boys don¡¯t want to see material weakness ahead of next autumn¡¯s Party Congress. But we¡¯re currently near peak impulse from China¡¯s Q1 stimulus.¡± 
In short, Peters is saying that, with the appreciating dollar and rising interest rate environment, growth from emerging markets as a whole will falter, since emerging markets have effectively leveraged their economies to Chinese growth. It used to be the case that they were closely tied to U.S. growth, but it is now China which dominates the EMs¡¯ trade flows [i.e. without China growth, the EMs languish]. The question is, can America reboot its growth whilst China and the EMs languish? It is another structural shift, whereas heretofore, it was vice versa: without U.S. growth, the EMs and China languished. Now it is the converse. 
Hollowed-Out Economies 
There are other structural changes of course which will make it harder for the industrially hollowed-out economies of the West to recuperate jobs off-shored earlier. Firstly, there has been a systemic shift of innovation and technology eastwards (often to a more skilled and better-educated workforce). This represents not only an economic event, but a redistribution of power too. In any case, technology in this new era is being more job destructive than creative. 
In one sense, Trump¡¯s economic plan to ¡°get America working again¡± through massive debt-financed, infrastructure projects, harks back to the Reagan era, which was also a period in which the dollar was strong. But yet again, ¡°things today are not what they were then.¡± Inflation then was at 13 percent, Interest rates were around 20 percent, and crucially, the U.S. debt to GDP ratio was a mere 35 percent (compared to today¡¯s estimate of 71.8 percent or 104.5 percent with external debt included). 
Then, as Jack Rickards has suggested , the strong dollar was deflationary (deliberately so), and interest rates had nowhere to go, but down. It was the beginning of the three decades¡¯ bond boom, which finally seems to have come to an end, coincident with Trump¡¯s election. Today, inflation has nowhere to go but up ¨C as have interest rates ¨C and the bond market, nowhere to go, but (perilously) down. 
Growth and Jobs? 
Can Trump then achieve growth and jobs through infrastructure expenditure? Well, ¡°growth¡± is an ambiguous, shape-shifting term. The first chart shows both sides of the equation ¡­ the annual GDP growth and the annual federal debt incurred, spent, and (thus counted as part of the growth) to achieve the purported growth. Source: http://econimica.blogspot.it/2016/11/trump-lies-no-different-than-obama-or.html 
The second chart shows the annual GDP minus the annual growth in federal debt to achieve that ¡°GDP growth.¡± In other words, unlike in the earlier Reagan times, more recently, the debt is producing no growth ¨C but ¡­ well ¡­ just more debt, mostly. 
In fact, what the second chart is reflecting is the dilution ¨C through money ¡°printing¡± ¨C of purchasing power: away from one entity (the American consumer), through the intermediation of the financial sector, to other entities (mostly financial entities, and to corporations buying back their own shares). This is debt deflation: the American consumer ends having less and less purchasing power (in the sense of residual discretionary income). 
The point here is that ¡°growth¡± is becoming rarer everywhere. Russia and China, like everyone else, are in search for new sources for growth. 
As Rickards has said, debt is the ¡°devil¡± that can undo Trump¡¯s whole schema: a ¡°$1 trillion infrastructure refurbishment plan, along with his proposal to rebuild the military, will ¡ª at least in the short-term ¡ª significantly increase annual deficits. In fact, deficits are already soaring; the fiscal 2016 budget hole jumped to $587 billion, up from $438 in the prior year, for a huge 34% increase¡­in addition to this, Trump¡¯s protectionist trade policies would implement either a 35% tariff on certain imports or would require these goods to be produced inside the United States, at much higher prices. For example, the increase in labor costs from goods made in China would be 190% when compared to the federally mandated minimum wage earner in the United States. Hence, inflation is on the way.¡± 
In sum, self-sufficiency implies higher domestic costs and price rises for consumers. Source: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-16/saudis-china-dump-treasuries-foreign-central-banks-liquidate-record-375-billion-us-p 
Debt will rise. And there is seemingly already a buyers¡¯ strike against U.S. government debt underway: well over a third of a $1 trillion worth of Treasuries were disposed of, and sold in the year to Aug. 31 by foreign Central Banks. 
And who is buying it? (Below, the chart shows what this purchasing looks like, as a percentage of total debt issued by the Treasury). Well, foreign central banks have disappeared. (The Chinese have not bought a U.S. Treasury bond since 2011.) (Above: who purchased the marketable debt as a percentage, by period)Source: http://econimica.blogspot.it/2016/11/trump-lies-no-different-than-obama-or.html 
It is the American public who are buying. Will they be willing to take on Trump¡¯s $1 trillion infrastructure spree? Or, will it be ¡°printed¡± in yet another dilution of the American consumer¡¯s purchasing power? The question of whether the infrastructure splurge does give growth hangs very much in the balance to such answers. (Equity shares in construction firms will do okay, of course). 
The bottom line: (Michael Pento, Pento Report ): ¡°If interest rates continue to rise it won¡¯t just be bond prices that will collapse. It will be every asset that has been priced off that so called ¡®risk free rate of return¡¯ offered by sovereign debt. The painful lesson will then be learned that having a virtual zero interest rate policy for the past 90 months wasn¡¯t at all risk free. All of the asset prices negative interest rates have so massively distorted including; corporate debt, municipal bonds, REITs, CLOs, equities, commodities, luxury cars, art, all fixed income assets and their proxies, and everything in between, will fall concurrently along with the global economy. 
¡°For the record, a normalization of bond yields would be very healthy for the economy in the long-run, as it is necessary to reconcile the massive economic imbalances now in existence. However, President Trump will want no part of the depression that would run concurrently with collapsing real estate, equity and bond prices.¡± 
A Pending Financial Crisis 
Trump, to be fair, has said consistently throughout the election campaign that whoever won the Presidential campaign to take office in January would face a financial crisis. Perhaps he will not face the ¡°violent unwind¡± of the QE and bond bubble as some experts have predicted , but many more ¨C according to Bank of America¡¯s survey of 177 fund managers over the last six days, and controlling just under half a trillion of assets ¨C expect a ¡°stagflationary bond crash.¡± 
This has major political implications. Trump is setting out to do no less than transform the economy and foreign policy of the U.S. He is doing this against a backdrop of many of the followers of the liberal ¨¦lite, so angered at the election outcome, that they reject completely his electoral legitimacy (and, with the ¨¦lites themselves staying mum at this rejection of the U.S. democratic process). Movements are being organized to wreck his Presidency (see here for example). If Trump does indeed experience a severe financial ¡°unwind¡± at a time of such domestic anger and agitation, matters could turn quite ugly.

Exclusive: By inviting in Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat hostile to ¡°regime change¡± wars, President-elect Trump may be signaling a major break with Republican neocon orthodoxy and a big shake-up of the U.S. foreign policy establishment, writes Robert Parry. 
By Robert Parry 
Two weeks after Donald Trump¡¯s shocking upset of Hillary Clinton, the imperious and imperial neoconservatives and their liberal-interventionist understudies may finally be losing their tight grip on U.S. foreign policy. 
The latest sign was Trump¡¯s invitation for a meeting with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, on Monday. The mainstream media commentary has almost completely missed the potential significance of this start-of-the-work-week meeting, suggesting that Trump is attracted to Gabbard¡¯s tough words on ¡°radical Islamic terrorism.¡± Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. 
Far more important is that Gabbard, a 35-year-old Iraq War veteran, endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries because of his opposition to neocon/liberal-hawk military adventures. She starred in one of the strongest political ads of the campaign, a message to Hawaiians, called ¡°The Cost of War.¡± 
¡°Bernie Sanders voted against the Iraq War,¡± Gabbard says. ¡°He understands the cost of war, that that cost is continued when our veterans come home. Bernie Sanders will defend our country and take the trillions of dollars that are spent on these interventionist, regime change, unnecessary wars and invest it here at home.¡± 
In the ad, Gabbard threw down the gauntlet to the neocons and their liberal-hawk sidekicks, by accusing them of wasting trillions of dollars ¡°on these interventionist, regime change, unnecessary wars.¡± Her comments mesh closely with Trump¡¯s own perspective. 
After the meeting on Monday, Gabbard released a statement confirming that the focus of the discussion had been her opposition to escalating the war in Syria by following neocon/liberal-hawk suggestions for a ¡°no-fly zone¡± that would require widespread U.S. military destruction of Syrian government installations and the killing of a large number of Syrians. 
¡°President-elect Trump asked me to meet with him about our current policies regarding Syria, our fight against terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, as well as other foreign policy challenges we face,¡± Gabbard said. ¡°I felt it important to take the opportunity to meet with the President-elect now before the drumbeat of war that neocons have been beating drag us into an escalation of the war to overthrow the Syrian government ¡ª a war which has already cost hundreds of thousands of lives and forced millions of refugees to flee their homes in search of safety for themselves and their families. ¡­ 
¡°While the rules of political expediency would say I should have refused to meet with President-elect Trump, I never have and never will play politics with American and Syrian lives. ¡­ 
¡°I shared with [President-elect Trump] my grave concerns that escalating the war in Syria by implementing a so-called no fly/safe zone would be disastrous for the Syrian people, our country, and the world. It would lead to more death and suffering, exacerbate the refugee crisis, strengthen ISIS and al-Qaeda, and bring us into a direct conflict with Russia which could result in a nuclear war.¡± 
Trading Places 
So, the surprise election results on Nov. 8 may have represented a ¡°trading places¡± moment for the neocons and liberal hawks who were eagerly counting the days before the ¡°weak¡± President Barack Obama would turn over the Commander-in-Chief job to former Secretary of State Clinton who had made clear that she shared their hawkish agenda of escalating the war in Syria with a ¡°no-fly/safe zone,¡± and ratcheting up the New Cold War with Russia. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addressing the AIPAC conference in Washington D.C. on March 21, 2016. (Photo credit: AIPAC) 
There was even speculation that one of Clinton¡¯s neocon favorites within the State Department, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland, might be rewarded with State¡¯s top job for her ¡°regime change¡± in Ukraine that sparked the start of the New Cold War in 2014. 
Nuland, the wife of arch-neocon Robert Kagan , sabotaged President Obama¡¯s emerging strategy of collaborating with Russian President Vladimir Putin on sensitive global issues. In 2013-14, Putin helped orchestrate two of Obama¡¯s brightest foreign policy successes: Syria¡¯s surrender of its chemical weapons arsenal and Iran¡¯s guarantee that it would not develop nuclear weapons. 
But those agreements infuriated the neocons who favored escalating both crises into direct U.S. bombing campaigns aimed at Syria and Iran ¨C in accordance with the desires of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Saudi monarchy. Yet. there was perhaps even greater alarm at what the next move of the Obama-Putin tag team might be: demanding that Israel finally get serious about a peace deal with the Palestinians. 
So, the neocons took aim at Ukraine, which neocon National Endowment for Democracy President Carl Gershman identified as ¡°the biggest prize¡± and an important stepping stone to an even bigger prize, a ¡°regime change¡± in Moscow removing Putin . 
While Gershman¡¯s NED funded (with U.S. taxpayers¡¯ money) scores of projects inside Ukraine, training anti-government activists and journalists, Nuland took the point as the key organizer of a putsch that removed elected President Viktor Yanukovych on Feb. 22, 2014, and replaced him with a fiercely anti-Russian regime. 
Given the geopolitical sensitivity of Ukraine to Russia, including its naval base on the Crimean peninsula, Putin had little choice but to react, supporting a referendum in Crimea in which 96 percent of the voters favored leaving Ukraine and rejoining Russia ¨C and assisting ethnic Russian rebels in the east who resisted the violent ouster of their president. 
Of course, the mainstream Western news media presented these developments as simply a case of ¡°Russian aggression¡± and a ¡°Russian invasion.¡± And, faced with this new ¡°group think,¡± Obama quickly abandoned his partner, Putin, and joined in the chorus of condemnations. 
Nuland emerged as a new star inside the State Department, a hero of the New Cold War which was expected to funnel trillions of tax dollars into the Military-Industrial Complex. 
Trump¡¯s Heresy 
But Trump surprisingly adopted the position that Obama shied away from, a recognition that Putin could be an important asset in resolving major international crises. The real-estate-mogul-turned-politician stuck to that ¡°outside-the-mainstream¡± position despite fierce attacks from rival Republicans and Democratic presidential nominee Clinton, who even mocked him as Putin¡¯s ¡°puppet.¡± President Barack Obama meets with President Vladimir Putin of Russia on the sidelines of the G20 Summit at Regnum Carya Resort in Antalya, Turkey, Sunday, Nov. 15, 2015. National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice listens at left. (Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) 
After Trump¡¯s upset victory on Nov. 8, many pundits assumed that Trump would fall back in line with Washington¡¯s hawkish foreign-policy establishment by giving top jobs to neocons, such as former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton and ex-CIA Director James Woolsey, or Netanyahu favorites, such as former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney or ex-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. 
So far, however, Trump has followed a different course, more in line with the libertarian thinking of the Koch brothers ¨C not only the more famous ones, Charles and David, but also their long-estranged brother William, who I¡¯m told have become behind-the-scenes advisers to the President-elect. 
Though Trump did offer high-profile meetings to the likes of Romney and Giuliani, he has yet to hand over any key foreign-policy job to the Republican neocon wing. His one major announcement in that area has been naming as National Security Advisor retired Gen. Michael Flynn, who led the Defense Intelligence Agency when it produced a prescient warning that U.S. policy in Syria would lead to the creation of an ¡°Islamic State.¡± 
Though Flynn is regarded as a hardliner in the fight against Islamic jihadist terror, he is seen as an independent thinker regarding how best to wage that war. For instance, Flynn has objected to the notion that drone strikes, i.e., killing off individual jihadists, is a route to success. 
¡°We¡¯ve tended to say, drop another bomb via a drone and put out a headline that ¡®we killed Abu Bag of Doughnuts¡¯ and it makes us all feel good for 24 hours,¡± Flynn said . ¡°And you know what? It doesn¡¯t matter. It just made them a martyr, it just created a new reason to fight us even harder.¡± 
That leaves open the possibility that a President Trump might eschew the ¡°whack-a-mole¡± approach that has bedeviled the ¡°war on terror¡± and instead go after the ¡°mole nest¡± ¨C if you will ¨C the Saudi monarchy that has long financed Islamic extremists both through the fundamentalist Wahhabi brand of Sunni Islam and by supplying money and weapons to jihadists dating back at least to the Afghan mujahedeen in the 1980s, the origin of modern Islamic terrorism. 
Traditional U.S. politicians have recoiled from facing up to the hard reality that the Saudi monarchy is the real ¡°terror central¡± because of Saudi Arabia¡¯s enormous riches and influence, which is now enhanced by its quiet alliance with Israel in their joint campaign against the so-called ¡°Shiite crescent,¡± from Iran through Syria to Lebanon¡¯s Hezbollah. 
Taking on this Saudi-Israel nexus has long been regarded as political suicide, given Israel¡¯s extraordinary lobbying power and Saudi Arabia¡¯s exceptional wealth. But Trump may be assembling a team that is ¡°crazy¡± enough to take on that mission. 
So, while the fight over the future of U.S. foreign policy is far from over ¨C the neocons will surely flex their muscles at the major think tanks, on the op-ed pages and inside the halls of Congress ¨C the Trump transition is showing some creativity in assembling a national security team that may go in a very different direction. 
Much will become apparent in Trump¡¯s choice of Secretary of State. If it¡¯s someone like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, or Rep. Gabbard or a libertarian from the Kochs¡¯ world, that would be bad news for the neocons. If it¡¯s someone like Romney, Giuliani, Bolton or Woolsey, then that will mean that President-elect Trump has blinked and the neocons can breathe a sigh of relief.

The mixed signals from Donald Trump¡¯s transition are creating diverse interpretations of where his foreign policy is headed, with ex-CIA analyst Melvin A. Goodman seeing reasons to worry about more neocon warmongering. 
By Melvin A. Goodman 
My favorite philosopher, Garrison Keillor, stated in a different era that ¡°it will get worse before it gets worse.¡± Well, once again, here we are. President-elect Donald Trump¡¯s naming of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser; Sen. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, R-Alabama, as attorney general; and Rep. Michael Pompeo, R-Kansas, as director of the Central Intelligence Agency suggests that the dangerous positions taken by Trump during the presidential campaign will be supported by his  . Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn speaks at the Defense Intelligence Agency on July 24, 2012. (DoD photo by Erin A. Kirk-Cuomo) 
All three of these men have pandered to the Trump agenda and have taken particularly hardline views on matters dealing with immigration, the Muslim community, and the use of force. If Donald Trump actually decides to name a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton¡¯s use of email at the Department of State, then he will have the support of these three men. 
Lt. Gen. Flynn is in a position to do the most damage to the national security interests of the United States. He was forced into retirement from the military in 2014 when the Joint Chiefs of Staff needed to stop his politicization of intelligence as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and his brutal management style resembling that of Captain Queeq on the USS Caine. 
Flynn reorganized the DIA in order to combine the roles of the intelligence analysts and the operatives, which created a smoother path for politicizing intelligence. This is the same reform that CIA director John Brennan has introduced into the CIA, which has had its own problems with politicized intelligence over the past several decades. 
At DIA, Flynn was known for endorsing specious intelligence reports and circulating his support for these reports in what was known facetiously as ¡°Flynn facts.¡± Currently there is an investigation of DIA for the tailoring of intelligence on the success of the U.S. Army in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Although the general has been praised for his work in the operational and tactical fields, there are no examples of the kind of strategic thinking or experience to believe that Flynn would be useful in coordinating the policy views of the entire national security bureaucracy or in providing objective and balanced intelligence to the President. 
Flynn has already changed his views to accommodate the interests of Trump. Once an opponent of torture and abuse, Flynn over the past year has become a supporter. His consulting company has lobbied on behalf of the authoritarian interests of Turkish President Erdogan, and Flynn himself has been a regular commentator on RT, Moscow¡¯s English language propaganda voice. 
At the Republican National Convention last summer, Flynn referred to Hillary Clinton as a member of the ¡°enemy camp¡± and led the chants of ¡°lock her up.¡± 
Pompeo¡¯s Hard Line 
Rep. Pompeo was an initial supporter of the Tea Party and predictably took positions against abortion (even in cases of rape and incest); against the Affordable Care Act; and against any effort on the part of the Environmental Protection Agency to eliminate greenhouse gases. He favors a return to unrestricted massive surveillance by the National Security Agency; a death sentence for Edward Snowden; and more vigorous use of enhanced interrogation techniques at Guantanamo. When his committee was confronted with pictures of hunger strikers at Guantanamo, Pompeo facetiously remarked that it ¡°looked like that they had put on weight.¡± Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas. 
Pompeo, like other members of the presidential transition staff, is a conspiracy thinker. He and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, who has been rumored as a possible choice as Secretary of Defense, were strong opponents of the Iran nuclear agreement and believe that there are secret side agreements that favor the interests of Tehran. Pompeo has charged that any Muslim citizen who doesn¡¯t vigorously denounce acts of terror is actually complicit with the attacks. 
Pompeo was a strong opponent of Senator Dianne Feinstein¡¯s devastating report on CIA torture and abuse, and conducted a vigorous attack on Secretary of State Clinton¡¯s role in the Benghazi tragedy. When his colleague, former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, issued a report exonerating Clinton, Pompeo attached a polemical rebuttal. 
Sen. Sessions has been rewarded with the Department of Justice for being the first elected official to come out in support of Donald Trump. He is strongly opposed to any immigration reform, and has received a grade of ¡°F¡± from various civil rights groups and the NAACP for his opposition to civil rights. 
In the 1980s, there was a successful bipartisan effort in the Senate to keep him from becoming a federal judge, with the decisive swing vote coming from Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Alabama. Sessions once referred to the American Civil Liberties Union as ¡°un-American and communist¡± for ¡°trying to force civil rights down the throats of people.¡± 
The appointment of a neoconservative   points the Trump administration in an extreme hardline direction. It is possible that the Director of National Intelligence will be weakened or even eliminated, and that the CIA will become even more involved in covert action, including regime change. The sudden resignation of James Clapper as director of national intelligence certainly points in this direction. 
President Barack Obama¡¯s failure to limit the CIA¡¯s paramilitary role and to seek accountability for the conduct of torture and abuse will allow   to get the CIA more heavily involved in paramilitary activities, which have damaged the reputation of the United States and the CIA in the past. 
The Iran-Contra scandal tarnished the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. CIA support for the mujahedeen in the 1980s led to the emergence of Al Qaeda and other fundamentalist terror organizations in the 1990s that we are still confronting. 
Although President Obama had some success in bringing sunlight into the darkened corridors of the national security state,  ¡¯s appointment of these individuals suggests that the secret state will once again expand. A greater era of secrecy will be harmful to the interests of American citizens and even to our democracy.

Exclusive: The U.S.-backed coup in Ukraine in 2014 sparked a New Cold War with Russia, but a President Trump could roll back tensions with a creative strategy for resolving the Ukraine standoff, writes Jonathan Marshall. 
By Jonathan Marshall 
If Donald Trump wants to make a decisive and constructive mark on U.S. foreign policy early in his presidency, there¡¯s no better place to start than by helping to end the brutal war in Ukraine that has claimed some 10,000 lives. President-elect Donald Trump 
The Obama administration helped ignite that war by attempting to yank Ukraine out of Russia¡¯s orbit and into the Western security and economic sphere. Working alongside the European Union, Washington fanned mass street protests that led to a violent putsch against Kiev¡¯s elected government in February 2014. Moscow responded by annexing (or, depending on your point of view, reunifying with) Russian-speaking Crimea, which is also headquarters of Moscow¡¯s Black Sea Fleet, and backing pro-Russia separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. 
Since then, the two sides have fought to a bloody stalemate. Besides killing thousands of civilians, the war has sunk Ukraine¡¯s economy and fostered rampant corruption. U.S. and E.U. sanctions have dragged down Russia¡¯s economy and derailed cooperation between Washington and Moscow in other theaters. Rising tensions between NATO and Russia have greatly raised the odds of an accidental military confrontation between the world¡¯s two largest nuclear powers. 
The best hope for Ukraine ¡ª and renewed East-West cooperation ¡ª is the Minsk Protocol, signed by Ukrainian, Russian, and European parties in the capital of Belarus on Sept. 5, 2014. The agreement provided for a ceasefire, an exchange of prisoners, and a framework for a political settlement based on giving the Donetsk and Luhansk regions a ¡°special status.¡± 
That agreement broke down amid renewed fighting until the parties signed the Minsk-2 Agreement on Feb. 12, 2015. It provided for constitutional reforms, elections in the two republics, and restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty over its borders. But Kiev has made no serious move to recognize the special status of its breakaway regions, and the two sides have engaged in sporadic hostilities ever since. 
Final Words 
Presidents Obama and Putin exchanged what may have been their final, desultory words on the subject at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru this month. Obama ¡°urged President Putin to uphold Russia¡¯s commitments under the Minsk agreements,¡± while a Russian spokesman said the two men ¡°expressed regret that it was not possible to make progress in Ukraine.¡± President Barack Obama meets with President Vladimir Putin of Russia on the sidelines of the G20 Summit at Regnum Carya Resort in Antalya, Turkey, Sunday, Nov. 15, 2015.

As current foreign policy messes go, however, the Ukrainian imbroglio may offer the greatest opportunities for a rewarding cleanup. Doing so will require both sides to acknowledge some fault and find creative ways to save face. 
Fortunately, President-elect Trump has created an opening for such a settlement by reaching out to Putin during the election campaign and explicitly declining to bash Russia for its annexation of Crimea (which followed a hastily arranged referendum in which the official results showed that 96 percent of the voters favored leaving Ukraine and rejoining Russia). 
There are also small signs of progress that give hope. A limited demilitarization accord signed in September led to a mutual retreat by the Ukrainian army and pro-Russia separatists from a small city in eastern Ukraine. The withdrawal was verified by observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a party to the Minsk accords. Meanwhile, Ukraine, Germany, France and Russia are working on a new roadmap to strengthen the ceasefire. 
Conditions for Peace 
In a June 2015 interview with Charlie Rose, Putin laid out clear and reasonable conditions for making the Minsk accord stick: Ukraine¡¯s anti-Russian President Petro Poroshenko speaking to the Atlantic Council in 2014. (Photo credit: Atlantic Council) 
¡°Today we primarily need to comply with all the agreements reached in Minsk ¡­ At the same time, I would like to draw . . . the attention of all our partners to the fact that we cannot do it unilaterally. We keep hearing the same thing, repeated like a mantra ¨C that Russia should influence the southeast of Ukraine. We are. However, it is impossible to resolve the problem through our influence on the southeast alone. 
¡°There has to be influence on the current official authorities in Kiev, which is something we cannot do. This is a road our Western partners have to take ¨C those in Europe and America. Let us work together. ¡­ We believe that to resolve the situation we need to implement the Minsk agreements, as I said. The elements of a political settlement are key here. There are several. . . . 
¡°The first one is constitutional reform, and the Minsk agreements say clearly: to provide autonomy or, as they say, decentralization of power. . . 
¡°The second thing that has to be done ¨C the law passed earlier on the special status of . . . Luhansk and Donetsk, the unrecognized republics, should be enacted. It was passed, but still not acted upon. This requires a resolution of the Supreme Rada ¨C the Ukrainian Parliament ¨C which is also covered in the Minsk agreements. . . . 
¡°The third thing is a law on amnesty. It is impossible to have a political dialogue with people who are threatened with criminal persecution. And finally, they need to pass a law on municipal elections on these territories and to have the elections themselves. All this is spelled out in the Minsk agreements. . . . 
¡°I repeat, it is important now to have a direct dialogue between Luhansk, Donetsk and Kiev ¨C this is missing.¡± 
Future of Crimea 
Any lasting settlement will also require some compromise over Crimea, which Putin has vowed never to relinquish. A map showing Crimea (in beige) and its proximity to both the Ukrainian mainland and Russia. 
As Ray McGovern, the CIA¡¯s former chief Russia analyst, has noted, the annexation of Crimea did violate a pledge that Russia made in 1994 ¡ª along with Great Britain and the United States ¡ª ¡°to respect the independence and sovereignty and existing borders of Ukraine,¡± as a precondition to Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons. Of course, the United States and the E.U. had already violated the same pledge by supporting a coup d¡¯¨¦tat against the country¡¯s elected government. 
McGovern cited other ¡°extenuating circumstances, including alarm among Crimeans over what the unconstitutional ouster of Ukraine¡¯s president might mean for them, as well as Moscow¡¯s not unfounded nightmare of NATO taking over Russia¡¯s major, and only warm-water, naval base at Sevastopol in Crimea.¡± 
In support of annexation, Russian and Crimean authorities also pointed to the hasty referendum that was held in Crimea in March 2014, which resulted in 96 percent support for reunification with Russia, a relationship dating back to the Eighteenth Century. Subsequent polls of Crimean opinion, conducted by Western firms, have largely confirmed support for the 2014 referendum on rejoining Russia. But the referendum did not have international observers and was not accepted by the United States and other Western nations. 
Condemning the annexation in a soaring speech about the ¡°rule of law¡± and America¡¯s dedication to universal principles, President Obama contrasted Crimea with Kosovo, which NATO forcibly broke away from Serbia in 1999. 
Obama said, ¡°Kosovo only left Serbia after a referendum was organized not outside the boundaries of international law, but in careful cooperation with the United Nations and with Kosovo¡¯s neighbors. None of that even came close to happening in Crimea.¡± 
Actually, none of that came close to happening in Kosovo, either. Obama¡¯s story was a myth, but it confirmed the powerful legitimacy offered by popular referenda, like those in Great Britain over Scottish independence or Brexit. 
Yet, as part of a permanent settlement of the larger Ukraine crisis, the Minsk signatories could agree to hold another, binding referendum in Crimea under international supervision to decide whether it stays under Russian rule or returns to Ukraine. 
To get Russia¡¯s buy-in, the United States and its European allies should agree to lift sanctions if Moscow abides by the referendum and other terms of the Minsk accord. They should also agree to rule out the incorporation of Ukraine into NATO, the original sin that sowed the seeds of crisis between Russia and the West. Russia, in turn, could agree to demilitarize its border with Ukraine. 
Obstacles to Settlement 
President Putin has signaled his willingness to compromise in several ways, including firing his hardline chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov, and welcoming the presence of armed observers from OSCE to monitor the Minsk agreement. The neo-Nazi Wolfsangel symbol on a banner in Ukraine. 
But major obstacles still impede progress. One is President Petro Poroshenko¡¯s stalling in the face of opposition to the Minsk accord by Ukrainian nationalists. Kiev needs to be given a firm choice: go it alone, or compromise if it wants continued economic support from the United States and Western Europe. The Obama administration has quietly urged the Poroshenko government to honor the Minsk agreement, but has never put teeth behind its entreaties. 
The other major obstacle is hostility from militarist hardliners in the West who propose arming Ukraine to ratchet up conflict with Russia. Prime examples include the State Department¡¯s chief policy maker on Ukraine, Victoria Nuland; former NATO Commander Gen. Philip Breedlove, who became infamous for issuing inflated warnings about Russian military operations; Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain; and Stephen Hadley, Raytheon board member and former national security adviser to President George W. Bush, who chairs the Orwellian-named United States Institute for Peace. 
But Trump will have great leeway as commander-in-chief to reject their advice and set a new direction for NATO¡¯s policy on Ukraine and Russia more generally. He has everything to gain by breaking the cycle of political conflict with Moscow. 
An ally in the Kremlin will immeasurably improve his chances of making deals in the Middle East, finding a way out of Afghanistan, and managing China. 
The next few months should tell us whether Trump has the independence, imagination, and gumption to do the right thing.

A sudden flood of cash has enabled the Green Party to demand recounts of votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, three formerly Democratic states that largely decided the 2016 election for Donald Trump, reports Joe Lauria. 
By Joe Lauria 
The Green Party is demanding a recount of votes in three key states that could potentially affect the outcome of the election that saw Donald Trump chosen as president. The party was able to raise $2.5 million needed to at least pay for the recount in Wisconsin in less than 12 hours from the time the Greens¡¯ intentions were reported by the media on Wednesday. 
Jill Stein, leader of the party that received less than 1 percent of the national vote, said in a press release that the Greens wanted the recount ¡°because reported hacks into voter and party databases and individual email accounts are causing many Americans to wonder if our election results are reliable.¡± Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. (Photos by Gage Skidmore and derivative by Krassotkin, Wikipedia) 
The Green Party wants recounts in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan ¨C the three states that effectively determined the result of the presidential race by slipping from the Democratic column in 2012. The deadline to file for a recount is Friday in Wisconsin, Monday in Pennsylvania and Wednesday in Michigan. 
The cost of the Wisconsin recount is $1.1 million, according to the Green Party press release . The release does not say what the cost for all three recounts is, but the party initially sought $2.5 million. That was widely reported as the total amount needed. But once that goal was reached, the target was jacked up to $4.5 million. 
The party¡¯s home page appeal for money says the entire cost with legal fees could be $6 million to $7 million. This statement also includes a quote from Stein that blames ¡°foreign agents¡± for hacking into ¡°party databases, private email servers, and voter databases in certain states.¡± Her quote in the press release removed the words ¡°foreign agents.¡± 
Slim Margins 
Trump narrowly beat Democratic contender Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and is leading in Michigan, which more than two weeks later is still too close to call. Just a 55,000-vote swing is all that is needed in the three states to flip the election to Clinton. 
On Tuesday it was reported that a group of U.S. professors ¨C computer scientists and elections lawyers ¨C had held a conference call with the Clinton campaign to ask it to file for an audit in the three states. They said that actual results differed from exit polls and that Trump had done considerably better in areas where electronic voting machines were used. Clinton did better where paper ballots were used. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. 
Some experts explained that electronic machines were used in rural areas, which were stronger for Trump, while paper ballots were used in urban areas largely backing Clinton. 
The academics lobbying the Clinton campaign have suggested that a foreign government may be behind the hacks. The Obama administration had said before the election that Russia was trying to influence the election through hacking, though no evidence was made public. 
In his final testimony to Congress last week, outgoing Director of National Intelligence James Clapper admitted that there was no proof about who was behind the supposed hacks into email accounts of Democratic leaders which proved embarrassing to the Clinton campaign. 
The Clinton campaign has made no statement about the recount. But many Clinton supporters have backed the effort online. The Trump transition team has made no comment. 
Trump won the Electoral College vote 290 to 232, with Michigan¡¯s 16 electoral votes still outstanding and with 270 votes needed to be elected President. Clinton won the national popular vote by about 2 million votes. 
The Green¡¯s Motive 
Because of Clinton¡¯s popular-vote plurality, there have been calls for electors from states that voted for Trump to change their vote to Clinton, but there is no indication that Trump¡¯s electors are switching sides. Twenty-four states do not legally bind electors to vote with the popular will of their states. The electors will vote in their state capitals on Dec. 19. The Congress will certify the election on Jan. 6. 
The move by the Greens raises many questions. At face value, they say the integrity of the electoral system is the only thing at stake. But the Greens must know that the recount effort could only help Clinton and hurt Trump. 
Is there some collusion between the Democratic Party and the Greens? Are they a Trojan horse for Clinton who can stay above the fray while getting the recount that some of her supporters have called for? 
Have wealthy Clinton donors been behind the flood of cash into the effort in so short a time? Or are the Greens sincere in wanting voting irregularities exposed? One theory is that the recount will expose cheating by both the Republicans and Democrats ¨C and thus reflect badly on the two-party system which has marginalized the Greens and other third parties. 
There¡¯s also the mystery of why one Stein quote mentions ¡°foreign agents¡± while another doesn¡¯t. In the waning days of the campaign, Clinton and her surrogates attacked Trump by suggesting Russian agents were conspiring to install him in the White House. Why did Stein, at least briefly, pick up that Clinton theme even though DNI Clapper had distanced himself from the accusation? 
Though there¡¯s widespread doubt among election experts that an audit of the results in the three states will swing the election to Clinton, there now is the possibility that the unpredictable 2016 election might still have a few last-minute twists.

The voting machines have decided who will be the next puppet figurehead of the Pax Americana deep state for the next four years. The circus is over and the peanut shells are being swept out of the stands. So what do we have to show for all of it? 
Well, I have some good news, some bad news, and some not-so-good news for you. Let¡¯s start with the bad news. 
Apparently some people voted for Trump in the belief that he was some sort of anti-establishment truth-telling hero of the working class.

Whew! Finally, the charade is over. Donald Trump is now the President of the United States of America. What does that mean? It means that Simpsons prediction came true: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2146815/the-simpsons-correctly-predicted-a-donald-trump-presidency-16-years-ago-in-episode-set-in-the-near-future/ 
So now you know who to refer to for accurate predictions about the future. Goodbye Tarot cards, et al. In 1995 I recall reading a survey which concluded that America was not likely to be ready for a woman president for the next twenty years. Twenty-one years later, it looks like that prediction was true. Given that women in America to this day are paid 80% of what men are paid, it is not surprising that Americans find it tough to visualize a woman in the White House in any place other than the President¡¯s bed. 
So, what does Trump mean for America, for American Muslims, for Muslims worldwide, for non-whites in America and globally? I am asking this rhetorical question as I see all kinds of doomsday predictions flying around. I apologize for taking a different view. I see the Trump presidency as an opportunity for those who believe in the opposite of everything that Donald Trump promoted in his campaign to put their actions where their mouths are and show that they are as willing to stand up for what they believe in as he was. 
What does Trump mean for America? I hope he will be the best thing that happened to America ever. I hope that he can truly make ¡®America Great Again¡¯. I say that because though I am not American (should I say, ¡®Thank God?¡¯), I am one who believes that a truly ¡®Great America¡¯, can make this world great. The world truly needs to change. We need someone to lead the way to make the world compassionate, caring, fighting against injustice, corruption and poverty; disease and ignorance. Which nation is better suited to lead that fight? America has the resources, the intelligence, the education and the leadership ability which I hope it chooses to exercise. Trump won on the anti-establishment platform. I support that fully. The establishment has shown that what it can do is to fail spectacularly. The economy crashed and Obama rewarded those who crashed it. People were and are homeless when there are empty homes on foreclosed loans enough for every American to have two homes, not only one. Yet they are on the streets. I hope Trump can put Americans back in their own homes. 
Bush father and son, started never ending wars. Obama continued them adding his own flavor to it of drone strikes ¨C using technology to create bug splats (the arrogance is incredible) ¨C thereby escalating the global threat level that comes from driving people to desperation. Obama¡¯s dabbling (what else to call it?) in Middle Eastern politics resulted in continuing the misery for people of Afghanistan and Iraq and new misery for people of Syria and by inference for the rest of the world. And to top it all ISIS came into being because of all of the above. The credit can be shared by all of them. So, Trump standing against the establishment means that he is against all of this. I sincerely hope so. 
All the jingoism that he rode on will get tempered when it comes to facing reality. It is easy to talk about kicking out the Mexicans and so on. But the day he does that, reality will dawn on him and his cohorts like it did on those who voted Pro-Brexit; that the rich need the poor to survive while the poor don¡¯t need the rich. When nice white Americans get to pay $3 per potato, they will realize the value of cheap labor. Meanwhile some contractor will get the contract to build the Wall, which he will do from the Mexican side, no doubt as otherwise his margin will not make it worthwhile. So also, the wonderful idea to outlaw the H-1 visa. I don¡¯t think it will take very long for Trump and his gang to realize that there is a reason there are blond jokes. And that Indians are not blond. Go figure that. 
The good news is that Trump made public what was private ¨C racism, misogyny in a country that never stops ¡®trumpeting¡¯ about women¡¯s equality, support for genocide, wars and weapons sales, the evils of unbridled capitalism, locker-room conversations which indicate attitudes ¨C have all come out of the closet and locker-room. Now it is up to those who like to say that they believe in the opposite of all these things, to get off their backsides and bring about change. They can no longer live the lives of pretense and lies that they had become used to, saying, ¡®It is not happening here.¡¯ Trump proved that it is happening and has trumpeted it from the top of Trump tower. Sorry for so much bad punning in one breath. But there you go. 
As for Muslims and Trump, believe me Trump is far better than what Muslims have seen in the past. He is far better than what we have today. Take Sisi, the Oily royals who are personal friends of every weapons dealer, the Paki leadership and I can think of several more and Trump begins to look like a choir boy. What will he do that is not already happening? Frankly I don¡¯t know and don¡¯t care to speculate because the prime movers behind Muslim affairs and how they are, are Muslims themselves. Our leadership or more correctly its spectacular failure. Ordinary citizens pay the price, but what¡¯s new about that? The fact remains that until we sort that out and do something about taking charge of our destiny, we must remain satisfied with others writing the script we are compelled to live by. Play endings depend on the script, not on the players. 
India is a classic example where a so-called minority of 200 million is kicked around like a football and used at will by every mercenary politician for his own ends. But Indian Muslims seem to be satisfied with that, so who is anyone else to complain. If you disagree and tell me that they are not satisfied, then I must ask you what it is that prevents them from doing what is glaringly obvious; get their act together, change their leaders and write their own script. 200 million is not a minority. It is a nation. But only if it chooses to be. Same story for Muslims globally. No point in blaming Trump or looking up to him to find solutions. It is our problem and we must solve it, so let us start doing that. 
Two other points: what about wars, global warming and such issues? Well, when you have a nation that lives on perpetual warfare and is supported in that by all the other major industrial nations who either manufacture and sell weapons or buy them, how can you pin it all on Trump? If weapons are made and sold, there will be wars. Wars will happen if they continue to make profits for those who run them. That people die is incidental. Those at the top who laugh all the way to the bank, don¡¯t. Those that do, don¡¯t count. They are ¡®collateral¡¯, who are necessary to prove the efficacy of the weapons that were used to vaporize them. If it wasn¡¯t for the bugs who splatted, how would you assess the drones or their operators? The fact that the bugs were innocent or that they had families and so on; well, bugs are bugs. And that¡¯s all that there is to it. 
Global warming? America decided on that when it chose Bush instead of Al Gore. For a minute I thought that was because they got confused because his name is Al Gore like Al Ghurair. But then I realized that it was because he had a terminal problem; he had a brain. See his famous movie, An Inconvenient Truth, and you will see what I mean. https://www.algore.com/library/an-inconvenient-truth-dvd If you do nothing else, buy this and see it. At least you will know why you died. Since you chose that, especially Americans, I believe it is only fair that you understand what you did. With Trump, that came out in the open, so get used to summer all year long. You won¡¯t need to go to the French Riviera for a tan. You can get it at home. That is not inconvenient. 
Add to this the effect ofunending wars, refugee movement, changing cultures, security nightmares coming true, widening gap between the rich and the poor, global poverty and hunger, preventable disease which is not prevented because there¡¯s no profit in it ¨C when I think about all this and Trump¡¯s election, Nero comes to mind. Renewing our link with tradition. Let us dance to the tune. What¡¯s the use of fiddling otherwise? 
Final question that everyone is asking, ¡®How safe is it to have someone like Trump with his finger on the nuclear button?¡¯ 
My answer is, ¡®The one who actually pressed that button was as different from Trump as could be. Yet he did it.¡¯ Let me leave you to figure out the rest. 
Meanwhile it is midnight where I live, far away from Trump and America and time to go to bed. Truly it is said that there is solace in sleep. So, good night, world. Sleep well. As long as you stay asleep you can escape responsibility.

The American journalist, Edward Bernays, is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. 
The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho-analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term ¡°public relations¡± as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions. 
In 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade ¨C behaviour then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, ¡°Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!¡± 
Bernays¡¯ influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret, he said, was ¡°engineering the consent¡± of people in order to ¡°control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it¡±. 
He described this as ¡°the true ruling power in our society¡± and called it an ¡°invisible government¡±. 
Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. 
Imagine two cities. 
Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. 
But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties. 
In the second city ¨C in another country nearby ¨C almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. 
The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by ¡°us¡± ¨C by the United States and Britain. They even have a media centre that is funded by Britain and America. 
Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys, condemned for assaulting and bombing the city ¨C which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city. 
Confusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad. 
What is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. 
Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today. 
Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was ¡°vindicated¡± for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell¡¯s fabrications. 
The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, ¡°What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?¡± 
He replied that if journalists had done their job, ¡°there is a very, very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq¡±. 
It was a shocking statement, and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question ¡ª Dan Rather of CBS, David Rose of the Observer and journalists and producers in the BBC, who wished to remain anonymous. 
In other words, had journalists done their job, had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children would be alive today, and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul. 
There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on 7 th July 2005. There would have been no flight of millions of refugees; there would be no miserable camps. 
When the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November, President Francoise Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria ¨C and more terrorism followed, predictably, the product of Hollande¡¯s bombast about France being ¡°at war¡± and ¡°showing no mercy¡±. That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak. 
¡°When the truth is replaced by silence,¡± said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko, ¡°the silence is a lie.¡± 
The attack on Iraq, the attack on Libya, the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West. The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant. They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country. 
The same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an ¡°agreement¡± that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy. His people were bombed, and he was prosecuted in The Hague. Independence of this kind is intolerable. 
As WikLeaks has revealed, it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, that he was attacked. 
From that moment, the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics ¨C the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage. 
Why is this not news? The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross, who was responsible for operating sanctions against Iraq, told me: ¡°We would feed journalists factoids of sanitised intelligence, or we would freeze them out. That is how it worked.¡± 
The West¡¯s medieval client, Saudi Arabia ¨C to which the US and Britain sell billions of dollars¡¯ worth of arms ¨C is at present destroying Yemen, a country so poor that in the best of times, half the children are malnourished. 
Look on YouTube and you will see the kind of massive bombs ¨C ¡°our¡± bombs ¨C that the Saudis use against dirt-poor villages, and against weddings, and funerals. 
The explosions look like small atomic bombs. The bomb aimers in Saudi Arabia work side-by-side with British officers. This fact is not on the evening news. 
Propaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education ¨C Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Columbia ¡ª and with careers on the BBC, the Guardia n, the New York Times , the Washington Post . 
These organisations are known as the liberal media. They present themselves as enlightened, progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist. They are anti-racist, pro-feminist and pro-LGBT. 
And they love war. 
While they speak up for feminism, they support rapacious wars that deny the rights of countless women, including the right to life. 
In 2011, Libya, then a modern state, was destroyed on the pretext that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit genocide on his own people. That was the incessant news; and there was no evidence. It was a lie. 
In fact, Britain, Europe and the United States wanted what they like to call ¡°regime change¡± in Libya, the biggest oil producer in Africa. Gaddafi¡¯s influence in the continent and, above all, his independence were intolerable. 
So he was murdered with a knife in his rear by fanatics, backed by America, Britain and France. Hillary Clinton cheered his gruesome death for the camera, declaring, ¡°We came, we saw, he died!¡± 
The destruction of Libya was a media triumph. As the war drums were beaten, Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian : ¡°Though the risks are very real, the case for intervention remains strong.¡± 
Intervention ¡ª what a polite, benign, Guardian word, whose real meaning, for Libya, was death and destruction. 
According to its own records, Nato launched 9,700 ¡°strike sorties¡± against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. They included missiles with uranium warheads. Look at the photographs of the rubble of Misurata and Sirte, and the mass graves identified by the Red Cross. The Unicef report on the children killed says, ¡°most [of them] under the age of ten¡±. 
As a direct consequence, Sirte became the capital of ISIS. 
Ukraine is another media triumph. Respectable liberal newspapers such as the New York Times , the Washington Post and the Guardian , and mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC, NBC, CBS, CNN have played a critical role in conditioning their viewers to accept a new and dangerous cold war. 
All have misrepresented events in Ukraine as a malign act by Russia when, in fact, the coup in Ukraine in 2014 was the work of the United States, aided by Germany and Nato. 
This inversion of reality is so pervasive that Washington¡¯s military intimidation of Russia is not news; it is suppressed behind a smear and scare campaign of the kind I grew up with during the first cold war. Once again, the Ruskies are coming to get us, led by another Stalin, whom The Economist depicts as the devil. 
The suppression of the truth about Ukraine is one of the most complete news blackouts I can remember. The fascists who engineered the coup in Kiev are the same breed that backed the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Of all the scares about the rise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe, no leader ever mentions the fascists in Ukraine ¨C except Vladimir Putin, but he does not count. 
Many in the Western media have worked hard to present the ethnic Russian-speaking population of Ukraine as outsiders in their own country, as agents of Moscow, almost never as Ukrainians seeking a federation within Ukraine and as Ukrainian citizens resisting a foreign-orchestrated coup against their elected government. 
There is almost the joie d¡¯esprit of a class reunion of warmongers. 
The drum-beaters of the Washington Post inciting war with Russia are the very same editorial writers who published the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. 
To most of us, the American presidential campaign is a media freak show, in which Donald Trump is the arch villain. 
But Trump is loathed by those with power in the United States for reasons that have little to do with his obnoxious behaviour and opinions. To the invisible government in Washington, the unpredictable Trump is an obstacle to America¡¯s design for the 21 st century. 
This is to maintain the dominance of the United States and to subjugate Russia, and, if possible, China. 
To the militarists in Washington, the real problem with Trump is that, in his lucid moments, he seems not to want a war with Russia; he wants to talk with the Russian president, not fight him; he says he wants to talk with the president of China. 
In the first debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump promised not to be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into a conflict. He said, ¡°I would certainly not do first strike. Once the nuclear alternative happens, it¡¯s over.¡± That was not news. 
Did he really mean it? Who knows? He often contradicts himself. But what is clear is that Trump is considered a serious threat to the status quo maintained by the vast national security machine that runs the United States, regardless of who is in the White House. 
The CIA wants him beaten. The Pentagon wants him beaten. The media wants him beaten. Even his own party wants him beaten. He is a threat to the rulers of the world ¨C unlike Clinton who has left no doubt she is prepared to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and China. 
Clinton has the form, as she often boasts. Indeed, her record is proven. As a senator, she backed the bloodbath in Iraq. When she ran against Obama in 2008, she threatened to ¡°totally obliterate¡± Iran. As Secretary of State, she colluded in the destruction of governments in Libya and Honduras and set in train the baiting of China. 
She has now pledged to support a No Fly Zone in Syria ¡ª a direct provocation for war with Russia. Clinton may well become the most dangerous president of the United States in my lifetime ¨Ca distinction for which the competition is fierce. 
Without a shred of evidence, she has accused Russia of supporting Trump and hacking her emails. Released by WikiLeaks, these emails tell us that what Clinton says in private, in speeches to the rich and powerful, is the opposite of what she says in public. 
That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders. 
Today, the greatest build-up of American-led forces since World War Two is under way ¨C in the Caucasus and eastern Europe, on the border with Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, where China is the target. 
Keep that in mind when the presidential election circus reaches its finale on November 8 th, If the winner is Clinton, a Greek chorus of witless commentators will celebrate her coronation as a great step forward for women. None will mention Clinton¡¯s victims: the women of Syria, the women of Iraq, the women of Libya. None will mention the civil defence drills being conducted in Russia. None will recall Edward Bernays¡¯ ¡°torches of freedom¡±. 
George Bush¡¯s press spokesman once called the media ¡°complicit enablers¡±. 
Coming from a senior official in an administration whose lies, enabled by the media, caused such suffering, that description is a warning from history. 
In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German media: ¡°Before every major aggression, they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically for the attack. In the propaganda system, it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons.¡±

Donald Trump most likely will not be elected President. Still, his historic campaign has sent shock waves through the American body politic. All are asking what it means and what it portends. The focus is on America at home rather than abroad. Foreign policy issues have been overshadowed by anxious domestic concerns. Moreover, Trump never formulated a coherent view of international issues. Like the average guy, he simply spat out whatever thoughts passed through his head as he had caught snippets of Fox news. Any attempt to discern logic and strategy from Trump¡¯s disjointed exclamations proves frustrating. 
Trump¡¯s entire campaign conveyed emotions rather than considered thoughts. It played to the public¡¯s feelings ¨C amplifying them and channeling them into a turbid brew of primitive slogans. Energy was imparted through unbridled vehemence and the showmanship of the born despot. So it is those emotions that we should look at to see what is simmering behind the formal fa?ade of our democracy in action. For they will outlast the election. Therein lies their significance for possible effects on the United States relations with the rest of the world. 
If there is an appropriate label to stick on this fermenting vat, it is ¡°nativism.¡± By that we mean a rather inchoate mix of atavistic nationalism, xenophobia, aggressiveness, righteous religiosity and racism dressed up as patriotism. Deep-seated sense of grievance and pervasive feelings that the true American has been sold out provide the fuel. Each of these elements has precedents in American history and roots in American society. They periodically have surfaced in political movements from the ¡®Know-Nothings¡¯ who in the 1850s were empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by German and Irish Catholic immigrants, to the paranoia that accompanied the Red Scare in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution and then reappeared with greater intensity in the form of McCarthyism. 
Today¡¯s manifestations have a larger economic component. The plight of salaried workers after decades of wealth redistribution upwards, the hollowing out of the country¡¯s industrial core, the financializing of business, and the emergence of a ¡°gig¡¯ economy that promises only more dislocation, insecurity, skimpy or no benefits, and declining living standards have eroded the optimistic creed that has been the lifeblood of America. Rugged individualism dictates that individual persons should assume responsibility for their failings; stoic fatalism in the face of external forces that drain all hope is quite another matter. 
Blame, like discontent, is free-floating. Its locus shifts among Wall Street, Government leaders, and foreigners. The last most interests us here. Factors originating beyond the nation¡¯s borders are prominent targets. They range from ¡°globalization¡± as an abstract new reality to Benedict Arnold companies that off-shore jobs and tax liabilities to American leaders who sign away American interests in one-sided trade deals to hostile governments who are cheaters. There is more than a grain of truth in the complaints directed at all of those mentioned. The ¡°common man,¡± as we quaintly used to call workers, indeed has been sold out by the ¡°bosses¡± ¨C economic and political. In truth, most of that selling out has been by elites favoring other elites here at home at the expense of the general populace. Foreigners are politically more convenient targets, though. 
The primary question is whether the disposition to blame external parties will manifest itself in antagonistic action. That has been the pattern elsewhere at other times. It is by no means obvious, though, that this logic holds in the case of the United States today. This is certainly true as regards any large-scale use of military force. Fifteen years of relentless, failed wars in the greater Middle East have drained the country of the passion for violence with which we retaliated for 9/11. Whether a President Clinton will expand operations in Syria is unaffected by what the American public¡¯s anger over illegal immigration or biased ¡°trade¡± agreements. A vague distaste for ungrateful, grasping foreigners does not eclipse aversion to expensive new adventures abroad or skepticism that they will work. 
As to Russia, the current high decibel condemnation of Moscow¡¯s alleged machinations is more an elite phenomenon, led by the security Establishment, than it is an expression of popular outrage. Few Americans identify with the Syrian ¡°rebels¡± whom Putin is fighting or Ukrainian para-militaries burning people alive in Odessa. The negative view of Russia, and Putin personally, so assiduously cultivated by politicos and the MSM does not translate into fear or hatred. The pervasive obsession with the Red Menace that marked the Cold War remains dormant. That is even true in Europe ¨C except for the Poles and the Baltics. Although that state of sentiment allows Washington to be rhetorically aggressive, and to take the much publicized steps of building up NATO forces around Russia¡¯s periphery. However, any action that is seen as actually raising a risk of direct conflict will be rejected. 
Conclusion : American policy toward Russia and the Middle East will follow the tracks laid down by the Obama administration with little deviation ¨C and no greater success. 
It is immigration that has been the hot button issue involving other countries. Passions are aroused by two things: the presence of millions of illegals from Mexico and Central America; and the prospect of Islamic terrorists entering the United States masquerading as refugees. The two merge at the most primitive level of emotions. Together, they deepen worries that the world is spinning out of control in ways that call into question the country they know (or imagine they know). Projections of rapidly increasing Latino populations which threaten to overwhelm school districts and voter rolls ruffle the feathers of many Middle Americans. Alarm that welfare and other social problems are siphoning off much needed public moneys in the age of austerity add a tangible economic element to these anxieties. 
Could this lead to implementation of the sorts of draconian ¡®ethnic cleansing¡± programs advocated by Donald Trump? Unlikely ¨C despite his ability to insert them into so-called ¡°mainstream¡± discourse about the problem. It is easy to exaggerate the extent and the intensity of anti-immigrant feelings. Most Americans encounter little of it in their daily lives. Those who do in places like Texas or California pretty much take it as a given: something that should be dealt with but not a matter requiring urgent action. Arizona is different. It¡¯s the extreme Rightists and the Republican politicos whom they have intimidated into obedience who make most of the noise. 
Foreign observers should note that the situation here is very different from that in Western Europe. Not only is the United States a very big country where relatively large populations can get lost but, equally important, social space is not as tightly configured. Outside of small towns, there is little sense of traditional community to be protected. Americanism trumps all as the successful integration of waves of immigrants throughout the country¡¯s history has demonstrated. While Latinos do present some unusual complications (unlike South or East Asian immigrants), visceral concerns about a denaturing of culture and society are relatively weak. (25% of all baseball players in the professional leagues are Latinos ¨C most from abroad). 
Conclusion : the politics of immigration policy reform has not changed. So, the policies and unresolved dispute over what to do next will remain in their present indeterminate state. 
The immigration-terrorism link is a far more passionate matter. It taps the terrorism psychosis that has gripped the country since 9/11. The graphic outbreak of mass violence over the past year has rekindled feverish emotions. The fact that the Orlando/San Bernadino/NY-NJ perpetrators had some vague connection with jihadi groups in the Middle East has given these events a transnational dimension. In fact, all of the perps were American-born citizens or had grown up in the US. Logically speaking, a detached observer could infer that restrictive immigration from the region or of Muslims generally would have no bearing on the level of terrorist threat. Facts in the age of Trump have lost much of their purchase on the American mind, though. 
One fact that is incontrovertible is that politicians run scared on all matters that are related to terrorism ¨C however oblique. The foot-dragging of President Obama on accepting any significant number of Syrian refugees is exhibit number one. Hostility toward Muslims generally is on the rise as witness the spike in abusive incidents in recent months. They now are occurring at a higher rate than they did in the wake of 9/11. By contrast, public authorities at all levels are less inclined to pursue surveillance and detention policies that skirt the law compared to that earlier period. 
The net effect will be a deepening perception around the world that the United States is hostile toward Islam. That is grist for the mill of the jihadis and opportunistic politicians. While it seems unlikely that signs of Islamo-phobia in American society will affect the thinking and actions of government leaders, they very well could register in the communities from which suicide bombers and terrorists are drawn ¨C in Europe especially and among certain unbalanced individuals in the United States itself. That cycle thereby gains velocity. 
What about the economic sphere? It is there that one might reasonably expect the preoccupations of the presidential campaign to affect the policy of a new administration. Economic nationalism follows naturally from aroused popular discontents that finger the forces of globalization as a prime cause of the economic plight in which tens of millions of American find themselves. That is to say, one might anticipate that American officials will take a more searching look at the ¡°bottom-line¡¯ impact of the accelerating integration of the world economy whose promotion has been a centerpiece of American foreign policy since the early 1990s ¨C as actively and optimistically promoted by HRC¡¯s husband. The process has tremendous momentum ¨C institutional (via the IMF, World Bank, EMU, mega-banks and MNS), political and intellectual. Economic thinking, academic and governmental, has been totally dominated by the twin market fundamentalist concepts of General Market Equilibrium Theory and benign globalization. While it has become trendy for all and sundry to make a ceremonial bow to the inequality phenomenon, it is hard to see the momentum of this juggernaut being blocked by disorganized displays of populism. 
Larry Summers personifies this state of affairs. One of the architects and master builders of the financialized, unregulated transnational economy who fought ruthlessly to bail out Wall Sreet at the expense of Main Street under Obama, he now punctuates his innumerable public appearances with warnings that we should attention to inequality dilemma. This homily is not a prelude to any action. Rather, it is akin to the Mafia don who devoutly crosses himself every time that his limousine crosses the path of a religious procession on a Saint¡¯s Day. 
That is the outlook in the United States under HRC. The one exception might by the TPP and TIIP treaties. Both were crafted by elites imbued by the optimistic globalization creed, both were kept secret except for the financial and commercial interests who were participants in their drafting, and both go far beyond traditional trade matters. The former, in particular, represents a radical transference of power from national governments to private parties institutionalized in expert panels heavily biased toward the latter. Indeed, many of its provisions may be unconstitutional ¨C as a fair-minded Supreme Court could rule. That recondite aspect of TPP did not get an airing during the campaign. However, the tying of the treaty to the damaging effects of ¡°trade¡± treaties forced even its supporters to equivocate. Hillary Clinton had been an enthusiastic backer until Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump began to reap political hay by condemning it. She now declares that is acceptable only if significant new conditions are met. 
What will be her ultimate position? She may be spared that agonizing decision were Obama able to push a lame-duck session of the Senate to ratify it. Otherwise, it may just be the one and only piece of American foreign relations that changes as a result of the election campaign. 
Continuity will prevail elsewhere. Americans overall will remain the insular, parochial, moralizing and largely ignorant citizens they have been. That leaves plenty of space for a foreign policy Establishment driven by a powerful inertia to add to its long string of mishaps. 
* Every society has its dark and dangerous undercurrents. America¡¯s is laced with racism and fed by a deep pool of personal insecurities. The recrudescence of coarse racism, the deep psychic anxieties of the white males of Middle America, the embrace of jingoism, the frustrations of trailer park super-patriots, and the desperation of tormented Evangelicals torn over the question of whether a prospective nuclear Iran is a sign that the End Days are approaching or a serious speed-bump on the road to Rapture ¨C together, these elements are creating an emotional maelstrom that has found an odd idol in the buffoonish persona of Donald Trump. The longer it lasts, the more attached he himself becomes to the pipe-dream of writing his name on the wind forever ¨C and the more his followers see themselves affirmed and exalted. 
Finally, we have to come to terms with the dismaying truth that public opinion, in individuals and in aggregate, is only exceptionally the outcome of an informed and thoughtful process of deliberation. It is the rationalist myth that we are by nature thinking creatures inclined to viewing the world around us in an emotionally detached, mature manner. Very, very few persons approximate that model. Inherited loyalties, deep seated prejudices and preferences, private emotions, the attraction or repulsion of personality ¨C all of these elements come into play to considerable degree. In today¡¯s society where attachments of all sorts are weak and evanescent, where political parties have little cohesion, where associational life has faded, where we are exposed to the barrage of media imagery and messaging, the rationalist model has become less and less valid. Most of us are shaped by influences that we only dimly perceive ¨C whether calculated intent lies behind them or not.",english,2016-10-28T21:57:37.505+03:00,counterpunch.org,US,23950,American Foreign Policy in the Post-Trump Era,0,http://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/dropzone/2016/10/87286100277470L.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

In the US, the political system has now disgorged two candidates the citizenry cannot be less enthusiastic about. Driven by ambition more than a love of the people or a sincere desire to serve, one can be forgiven for wondering if they are just as trapped by their motivations as the public in its two-party myopia. No authentic leader among the two ¡­ 
These thoughts lead to the rage of my youth, existentialism, and to Jean-Paul Sartre, who died 36 years ago last April. More than 50,000 mourners lined the streets and packed Montparnasse cemetery at his funeral, many quite young ¡ª improbable they would exhibit a similar interest in the successor philosophies, notably the current preoccupation with deconstruction, a focus on whether the written or spoken word is successful (or not) in clarity of meaning. 
Difficult as existentialism may be to pin down, there are a few necessary elements: the individual, free will as crucial to human existence, the subsequent responsibility for action that accompanies it, leading to an unavoidable anxiety as a consequence. The authentic life then is one chosen freely rather than imposed by society. No wonder it appealed to the young. 
What triggered this meandering into Sartre and his philosophy was Hillary Clinton¡¯s two-minute summing up at the end of the last debate. She attested to her lifelong concern (her latest claim) for improving the lives of children ¡ª a phrase bringing to mind a balancing scale. One one side the improved lives of children in Arkansas and the benefits of subsidies to children in general, and on the other the deaths of hundreds of thousands in Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere ¡ª the most vulnerable that is the old, the sick and the children bearing the brunt. Politicians are a breed apart, unconcerned with ¡®responsibility¡¯ and undisturbed by Sartre¡¯s ¡®anxiety¡¯. 
Not so long ago there was another US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, who, when asked about the 576,000 children who had died (according to a UN report) as a result of the Iraq embargo, simply dismissed the question as a price to be paid to be rid of Saddam Hussein. The embargo failed in that regard, and when Saddam was removed by the successor US government¡¯s military intervention, it resulted in chaos and the birth of ISIS. 
The Republican candidate, Donald Trump, is unique, in that responsibility washes over him and into the shower drain like a layer of dirt; he is devoid of it even in personal interaction. The only rational explanation of his behavior is the term ¡®prolonged adolescence¡¯ used by professionals. 
His basic issue over several decades has been bad deals ¡ª bad deals in defending allies who he feels do not pay enough for their defense and bad trade deals. Trying to peel off some voters, Hillary Clinton in the last debate pointed out that he took out an ad in The New York Times opposing the right¡¯s iconic Ronald Reagan over it. Like any business owner or high level executive, he intends to issue orders expecting them to be carried out. Good luck! It might explain the absence of concrete policy. 
The American public has been short changed into picking either the lesser of two evils, casting a protest vote with the minor left or right party, or just sitting this election out.

Elections in the United States are far and away the most expensive in the entire world. In 2012, the Federal Election Commission reported that $7 billion was spent on the presidential campaign. By the time the ink is dry on the 2016 election, the number will likely be even higher. American voters take for granted that political campaigns provide value that allows them to choose the candidate that best represents their ideology and policy positions. But, is this really the best system? Is it even a good one? 
The astronomical cost of campaigns in the U.S. prohibits all but a small handful of individuals with the celebrity and access to obscene sums money the realistic opportunity to compete. It should be no surprise that the two finalists for president in 2016 are both multi-millionaire oligarchs. Even so, they are dependent on raising hundreds of millions of dollars from big business and other special interests. 
Is it reasonable to expect that after such a process the winner of the election will be able to represent the interests of the average citizen rather than the super-wealthy elite individuals and corporations whose patronage allowed them achieve victory at the polls? 
A recent Princeton University academic study disputes this notion. Martin Giles and Benjamin Page write that statistical measures demonstrate that elites and business interests have an impact on policy directly correlated to their wealth, while the average voter has no discernible impact on policy at all. The influence of regular citizens is so low, the authors argue, that it would be inaccurate to characterize the American political system as a democracy. 
As greater economic power necessarily translates to greater political power, a reasonable remedy to the situation would be to decrease inequality in the United States. If inequality was drastically rolled back to a level closer to that found after the end of WWII ¨C through massive taxes on wealth, income and capital gains, along with the abolition of inheritance ¨C perhaps the conditions would exist for fair elections based on competitive campaigns. 
But absent such a drastic realignment of the politico-economic system, are there better possibilities for American citizens to elect officials that represent their interests? The nation has seen that Barack Obama¡¯s promises in 2008 to represent ¡°hope and change,¡± to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, close Guantanamo, operate transparently, limit domestic surveillance and reform taxes were, in reality, little more than hot air. 
What if instead of being allowed to create his own narrative, a summary of his undistinguished record as an lawyer from elite universities and corporate-friendly record state representative and politician was what voters had to guide their expectations of how he would govern? 
Perhaps the U.S. could look to Cuba, where the Revolutionary government ¨C facing unrelenting subversion and destabilization for decades by its imperial neighbor to the north ¨C has managed to eliminate money from politics entirely. At the municipal level, candidates spend no money and do not campaign at all. Instead, voters are presented with short biographies to reference in determining who they believe would better represent them. 
As the U.S. prepares for its latest electoral spectacle in a few weeks, I offer sample bios for the two presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, based on what they may look like if they were running for office in Cuba . ***",english,2016-10-28T21:59:16.373+03:00,counterpunch.org,US,23950,An Alternate Narrative on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,0,http://i1.wp.com/www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/dropzone/2015/06/OGFB4.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

He has already declared that he will recognize the results ¨C but only if he wins. 
That sounds like a joke. But it is far from being a joke. 
Trump has already announced that the election is rigged. The dead are voting (and all the dead vote for Hillary Clinton). The polling station committees are corrupt. The polling machines forge the results. 
No, that is not a joke. Not at all. 
This is not a joke, because Trump represents tens of millions of Americans, who belong to the lower strata of the white population, which the white elite used to call ¡°white trash¡±. In more polite language they are called ¡°blue collar workers¡±, meaning manual workers, unlike the ¡°white collar workers¡± who occupy the offices. 
If the tens of millions of blue-collar voters refuse to recognize the election results, American democracy will be in danger. The United States may become a banana republic, like some of its southern neighbors, which have never enjoyed a stable democracy. 
This problem exists in all modern nation-states with a sizable national minority. The lowest strata of the ruling people hates the minority. Members of the minority push them out of the lower jobs. And more importantly: the lower strata of the ruling majority have nothing to be proud of except for their belonging to the ruling people. 
The German unemployed voted for Adolf Hitler, who promoted them to the ¡°Herrenvolk¡± (master people) and the Aryan race. They gave him power, and Germany was razed to the ground. 
The one and only Winston Churchill famously said that democracy is a bad system, but that all the other systems tried were worse. 
As far as democracy is concerned, the United States was a model for the world. Already in its early days it attracted freedom-lovers everywhere. Almost 200 years ago, the French thinker, Alexis de Tocqueville, wrote a glowing report about the ¡°Democratie en Amerique¡±. 
My generation grew up in admiration of American democracy. We saw European democracy breaking down and sinking into the morass of fascism. We admired this young America, which saved Europe in two world wars, out of sheer idealism. The democratic America vanquished German Nazism and Japanese militarism, and later Soviet Bolshevism. 
Our childish attitude gave way to a more mature view. We learned about the genocide of the native Americans and about slavery. We saw how America is seized from time to time by an attack of craziness, such as the witch hunt of Salem and the era of Joe McCarthy, who discovered a Communist under every bed. 
But we also saw Martin Luther King, we saw the first black President, and now we are probably about to see the first female President. All because of this miracle: American democracy. 
And here come this man, Donald Trump, and tries to rip apart the delicate ties that bind American society together. He incites men against women, whites against blacks and hispanics, the rich against the destitute. He sows mutual hatred everywhere. 
Perhaps the American people will get rid of this plague and send Trump back where he came from ¨C television. Perhaps Trump will disappear like a bad dream, as did McCarthy and his spiritual forefathers. 
Let¡¯s hope. But there is also the opposite possibility: that Trump will cause a disaster never seen before: the downfall of democracy, the destruction of national cohesion, the breaking up into a thousand splinters. 
Can this happen in Israel? Do we have an Israel a phenomenon that can be compared to the ascent of the American Trump? Is there an Israeli Trump? 
Indeed, there is. But the Israeli Trump is a Trumpess. 
She is called Miri Regev. 
She resembles the original Trump in many ways. She challenges the Tel Aviv ¡°old elites¡± as Trump incites against Washington. She incites Jewish citizens against Arab citizens. Orientals of eastern descent against Ashkenazis of European descent. The uncultured against the cultured. The poor against all others. She tears apart the delicate ties of Israeli society. 
She is not the only one of her kind, of course. But she overshadows all the others. 
After the elections for the 20 th Knesset, in March 2015, and the setting-up of the new government, Israel was overrun by a band of far-right politicians, like a pack of hungry wolves. Men and women without charm, without dignity, possessed by a ravenous hunger for power, for conspicuousness at any price, people out for their own personal interest and for nothing else. They compete with each other in the hunt for headlines and provocative actions. 
At the starting line they were all equal ¨C ambitious, unlikable, uninhibited. But gradually, Miri Regev overtakes all the others. All they can do, she can do better. For every headline grabbed by another, she can grab five. For every condemnation of another in the media, she gets ten. 
Benyamin Netanyahu is a dwarf, but compared to this bunch he is a giant. In order to remain so, he appointed each of them to the job he or she is most unsuited for. Miri Regev, a rude, vulgar, primitive person became Minister of Culture and Sports. 
Regev, 51, is a good-looking woman, daughter of immigrants from Morocco. She was born as Miri Siboni in Kiryat-Gat, a place for which I have deep feelings, because it was there that I was wounded in 1948. Then it was still an Arab village called Irak-al-Nabshiyeh, and my life was saved by four soldiers, one of whom was called Siboni (no connection). 
For many years, Regev served in the army as a public relations officer, rising to the rank of Colonel. Seems that one day she decided to do public relations for herself, rather than for others. 
Since her first day as Minister of Culture, she has supplied the media with a steady stream of scandals and provocations. Thus she gradually overtakes all her competitors in the Likud leadership. They just cannot compete with her energy and inventiveness. 
She declared proudly that she sees her job as the elimination of all anti-Likud people from the cultural arena ¨C after all, ¡°that¡¯s what the Likud was elected for.¡± 
All over the world, governments subsidize cultural institutions and creative people, convinced that culture is a vital national asset. When Charles de Gaulle was the President of France, he was once approached by his police chiefs with the request to issue an arrest warrant for the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, because of his support for the Algerian freedom fighters. De Gaulle refused and said: ¡°Sartre too is France!¡± 
Well, Regev is no de Gaulle. She threatens to withdraw government subsidies from any institution that publicly opposes the policy of the right-wing government. She demanded the cancelation of the program of an Arab rapper who read from the works of Mahmoud Darwish, the adored national poet of the Arab citizens and of the entire Arab world. She demanded that all theaters and orchestras perform in the settlements in the occupied territories, if they want to keep their subsidies. 
This week she won a resounding victory when Habima, the ¡°national theater¡±, agreed to perform in Kiryat-Arba, a nest of the most fanatical fascist settlers. Indeed, no day passes without news of some new exploit by Regev. Her colleagues explode with jealousy. 
The basis of Israeli Trumpism and of Miri Regev¡¯s career is the deep resentment of the Oriental ¨C or Mizrahi ¨C community. It is directed against the Ashkenazim, the Israelis of European descent. They are accused of treating the Orientals with disdain, calling them ¡°the second Israel¡±. 
Since those recruits of Moroccan descent saved my life near the birthplace of Miri Regev, I have written many words about the tragedy of Mizrahi immigration, a tragedy of which I was an eye-witness from the first moment. Many injustices were committed by the established Jewish population against the new immigrants, mostly without bad intentions. But the greatest sin of all is rarely mentioned. 
Every community need a sense of pride, based on its past achievements. The pride was taken away from the Mizrahim, who arrived in the country after the 1948 war. They were treated as people devoid of culture, without a past, ¡°cave-dwellers from the Atlas mountains¡±. 
This attitude was a part of the contempt for Arab culture, a contempt deeply embedded in the Zionist movement. Vladimir (Ze¡¯ev) Jabotinsky, the right-wing Zionist leader and forefather of the Likud party, wrote in his time an article entitled ¡°The East¡±, in which he expressed his disdain for Oriental culture, Jewish and Arab alike, because of its religiosity and inability to separate between state and religion ¨C a barrier to any human progress, according to him. This article is rarely mentioned nowadays. 
The Oriental immigrants came to a country that was predominantly ¡°secular¡±, non-religious and Western. It was also very anti-Arab and anti-Muslim. The new immigrants understood quickly that, in order to be accepted in Israeli society, they must get rid of their traditional-religious culture. They learned to distance themselves from everything Arab, such as their accent and their songs. Otherwise it would be difficult to become part of the country¡¯s new society. 
Before the birth of Zionism ¨C a very European movement ¨C there was no enmity between Jews and Muslims. Quite the contrary. When the Jews were expeled from Catholic Spain, many centuries ago, only a minority immigrated to anti-Semitic, Christian Europe. The vast majority went to Muslim lands and was received with open arms all over the Ottoman Empire. 
Before that, in Muslim Spain, the Jews achieved their crowning glory, the ¡°Golden Age¡±. They were integrated in all spheres of society and government and spoke Arabic. Many of their men of letters wrote Arabic and were admired by Muslims as well as Jews. Maimonides, perhaps the greatest of Sephardic Jews, wrote Arabic and was the personal physician of Saladin, the Muslim warrior who vanquished the Crusaders. The ancestors of these Crusaders had slaughtered Jew and Muslim alike when they conquered Jerusalem. Another great Mizrahi Jew, Saadia Gaon, translated the Torah into Arabic. And so on. 
It would have been natural for Oriental Jews to take pride in this glorious past, as German Jews take pride in Heinrich Heine and French Jews in Marcel Proust. But the cultural climate in Israel compelled them to give up their heritage and pretend to admire solely the culture of the West. (Eastern singers were an exception ¨C first as wedding performers and now as media stars. They became popular as ¡°Mediterranean singers¡±.) 
If Miri Regev were a cultured person, and not merely a Minister of Culture, she would have devoted her considerable energy to the revitalization of this culture and giving back pride to her community. But this does not really interest her. And there is another reason. 
This Mizrahi culture is totally bound up with the Arab-Muslim culture. It cannot be mentioned without noticing the close relationship between the two for many centuries, during which Muslims and Jews worked together for the advancement of mankind, long before the world heard of Shakespeare or Goethe. 
I have always believed that restoring pride was the duty of a new generation of peace-lovers that will arise from among the Mizrahi society. Lately, men and women from this community have reached key positions in the peace camp. I have high hopes. 
They will have to fight the present culture minister ¨C a minister who has nothing in common with culture, and a Mizrahi woman who has no Mizrahi roots. 
I hope for a Jewish-Mizrahi revival in this country because it can advance Israeli-Arab peace and because it can strengthen again the loosened ties between the different communities in our state. 
As a non-religious person I prefer the Mizrahi religiosity, which has always been moderate and tolerant, to the fanatical Zionist-religious camp that is predominantly Ashkenazi. I have always preferred Rabbi Ovadia Josef to the Rabbis Kook, father and son. I prefer Arie Der¡¯I to Naftali Bennett.

Who will be the winners and the losers in the coming U.S. presidential election? Trump or Clinton, Clinton or Trump? The mainstream media is consumed with personality politics. Who could hold their nerve in a time of crisis? Whose integrity is purer (or less damaged)? If you were forced to choose, who would you trust your house keys with? It¡¯s entertainment for the masses. 
There will only be one group of winners: the interlocking oligarchy of financial, oil, military, agribusiness and pharmaceuticals interests than run the U.S. Whether it¡¯s Trump or Clinton, policy nuances aside, Washington¡¯s empire will stumble on. And it will do so not because of its inherent dynamism but because of its lies, manipulations, militarism and ability to crush any tendencies that exist towards a multi-polar world. 
The U.S. as a nation is bankrupt. It was in dire straits in the 1960s as a result of the Vietnam war and the emergence of economic rivals, such as France and Germany. Shifting off the gold standard and moving towards petrodollar recycling and treasury bond imperialism allowed the empire to remain on course and the dollar to remain as the world¡¯s reserve currency. Oil, not gold, became the mainstay of the empire. As long as the (oil-backed) dollar remains the global currency, the U.S. can continue to secure a free lunch courtesy of the rest of the world. 
Today, more than 60 per cent of all foreign currency reserves in the world are in U.S. dollars, and the U.S. will attempt to prevent countries moving off the dollar by any means possible, not least military. 
Washington¡¯s economic infrastructure is too weak to mount an economic recovery of note and U.S. corporate cartels will do anything to prevent policies that eat into their profits. They serve their own interests, not any notional ¡®national interest¡¯, and offshoring large parts of the US economy has served them well. 
Indeed, Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Secretary to the U.S. Treasury, notes that much of the most productive part of the economy has been moved offshore to increase corporate profits. By doing so, the U.S. has lost critical supply chains, industrial infrastructure and the knowledge of skilled workers. The U.S. could bring its corporations back home by taxing their profits abroad and could also resort to protective tariffs, but such moves would be contrary to the material interests of the ruling oligarchy of private interests, which hold sway over U.S. politics. 
Void of a suitable industrial manufacturing base or the will to invest in productive infrastructure, the U.S. continues with its speculative finance-related bubbles, its non-productive rentier economy and its predatory hold over the institutions of global capitalism (WTO, IMF, World Bank), while its drags its European vassal states into imperialist wars to help maintain global hegemony and ensure allegiance to the U.S. dollar. And this is exactly what we are seeing today as the strategy for global supremacy is played out. 
Over the past two decades, the U.S. has extended its influence throughout Eastern Europe and, among other places, in the Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria and Pakistan (with Washington¡¯s presence in neighbouring Afghanistan to all intents and purposes being a proxy war against Pakistan and Chinese influence there). With each passing year and each new conflict, the US has been drawing closer to direct confrontation with Russia and China. 
Russia is holding firm over Syria, which is vital to wider U.S. geopolitical goals that involve the weakening of the Russian energy-dependent economy and ousting Russia from its only naval base outside of the former USSR. A global US strategy is already in force to undermine China¡¯s growth and influence, part of which was the main reason for setting up AFRICOM: US Africa Command with responsibility for military operations and relations across Africa. But China is not without influence, and its actions are serving to weaken the hegemony of the U.S. dollar, thereby striking at a key nerve of U.S. power. 
China has been implementing bilateral trade agreements with a number of countries, whereby trade is no longer conducted in dollars but in local currencies. Over the past few years, China and other powers such as Russia have been making agreements to move away from the U.S. dollar in international trade. The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) also plan to start using their own currencies when trading with each other. Russia and China have been using their own national currencies when trading with each other for more two years. 
A report from Africa¡¯s largest bank, Standard Bank, stated a few years back: 
¡°We expect at least $100 billion in Sino-African trade ¨C more than the total bilateral trade between China and Africa in 2010 ¨C to be settled in the renminbi by 2015.¡± 
Under Saddam, Iraq was not using the dollar as the base currency for oil transactions, neither is Iran. Libya¡¯s Muammar Gadhaffi was talking about using a gold-backed dinar as the reserve currency for parts of Africa. U.S.-backed destabilisation and war followed. In 2000, Iraq converted all its oil transactions to euros. When U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, it returned oil sales from the euro to the dollar. Little surprise then that we have over the years seen on on-going saga by the U.S. to remove the Iranian regime via sanctions, destabilization, intimidation or the threat of all-out war. 
Iran has looked east to China, Pakistan and central Asia to counteract the effects of U.S. sanctions and develop its economy and boost trade. To sustain its empire, the US has effectively pushed the world into different camps and a new cold war: one not based on competing/alternative political or economic systems but a simmering conflict based on competing capitalist elites or ruling oligarchies who require control over their regional spheres of influence. 
Imperialism still reigns and neither side ¨C whether the U.S., Russia or China ¨C is particularly appealing, not least to those who believe that democratic (green) socialism is the best hope for humanity. In the absence of such a solution, a world not hurtling towards nuclear conflict would serve us well for the time being. 
The U.S. economy appears to be in terminal decline. The only way to prop it up is by corrupt, secretive, lop-sided trade agreements or by waging war to plunder resources and to ensure the print-as-you-go dollar remains the world reserve currency. An empire in decline armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons and trapped in a cycle of endless war to stave off ruin is a frightening scenario. Even more alarming is the talk of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against other nuclear powers such as Russia and China. 
This is the reality that faces the world. This is the reality that the corporate media will not inform the U.S. electorate about. The empire demands a sufficiently ignorant, misinformed public courtesy of a Fox News/CNN made-for-TV election stupor. An electorate that is sufficiently convinced to believe that millionaire-billionaire politicians who climb into bed with Wall Street banks and the rest of the ruling oligarchy have their interests at heart. 
A public for whom the term ¡®class consciousness¡¯ or ¡®class interest¡¯ figures little if anywhere in their political lexicon. The class that appears to be highly conscious of its interests is the one in control: the one that does its level best in ensuring that any such consciousness emerging within the ruled over is shut down at birth ¨C or suffocated within the mind-manipulating control mechanism that is the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. 
They sold your jobs to the lowest bidder abroad under the lie of ¡®efficiency¡¯ to make every greater profit, and they get you to blame your plight on immigrants. They use your taxes to kill and destroy countries under the lie of ¡®humanitarianism/fighting terror¡¯ to secure ever more mineral riches, and they get you to fear the latest bogeyman.

NEW YORK ¨C USA ¨C If you vote for Trump you vote for a future of serious financial upheaval, poverty, and destitution. 
We can see this in the market reaction to the recent Trump revival after Clinton¡¯s FBI charade. 
In all certain terms markets across the globe will continue dropping and if you have any equity in your pension plans, you can kiss that goodbye too. 
Trump will bring heavy inflation to America, and the globe, where prices of consumer goods will sky rocket. With heavy inflation and low salary growth, there will be less money to pay your mortgage, and many will default on their payments. 
Feeding your family will be a hard task, as the supermarkets raise their prices to never before seen levels. How about paying $14 for a loaf of bread or $23 for some rice. 
With the equity markets tanking, the dollar (DXY) will fall to 23 in a matter of days rendering it useless to pay off even a portion of America¡¯s vast deficit. China is already dumping their dollar reserves. 
Trump will be forced to cut welfare payments to all dependants citing no cash, but having the welfare bill cut will cause mass rioting amongst those who depend on EBT for food. 
Medical insurance, which is already skyrocketing in price will increase by over 400% when Trump tries to rearrange the insurance industry. This will mean only the very rich, like Trump, will be able to afford health care and the rest of the populace will be left in the dirt. 
Donald Trump is only doing this for his ego, he does not care for the poor. According to Trump the poor should all be mowed down by bulldozers and erased from America. He will only cater for the very rich, not the average American. 
Martial Law 
With extreme poverty, there will be civil unrest leading to civil war as some states will seek to secede from the union. Trump will engage the military to quash any civil unrest, however this will be a catalyst for even more unrest. 
It is for the sake of you and your family that you do not vote for Trump, he will destroy America from the inside out. He will send your sons and daughters to fight in the Middle East when he brings in the military draft. 
There is no going back, once you vote that is it. You will deal yourself and your family a death upon death, a misery so great that you will wish you had not been tricked by his lies, and he is a liar, a business man with many tricks to fool others so he can win through trickery. 
The Daily Squib has accurately predicted many future events and we stand by our word. This is our seal of approval, as we have already proven many accurate prophesies that have come to light many years before the actual event. 
If you want to die, if you want your children dead, if you want your grandchildren dead, then vote for Donald Trump.

  has won the presidency and he will now bide his time in making his agenda known. 


As the safe zones crack, the microaggressions rack, and the SJWs whack, there is great fear in America today. 
For eight long tortuous years we have been witness to the incessant moaning of the leftist socialist contingent and their wishes to curtail free speech, to force their doctrines into peoples¡¯ mouths, to promote their socialist utopian mirage that never happened upon the populace. 
As the Obama doctrine, a stout hatred of the British, a devout homosexual agenda and a consummate Marxist ideology were splattered onto every American orifice and fucked with lube, ends, it ends in shame, acrimony and the indignity of being erased completely from history without any recognition. 
Donald Trump will dismantle Obamacare, he will take down all these socialist executive actions, he will completely remove any evidence that Obama was ever president. There will be no trace of Obama in four years of Trump presidency left, and his legacy will be zero, just a grain of sand in an ocean of time. 
As for the global community, there will be a trade war with China now. The Chinese have for too long taken the U.S. for granted, and their time of selling Yanks cheap plastic trinkets that break after one day are over. Anything made in China is of the worst quality, and is immediately viewed as dispensable. 
The South Americans streaming over the borders will no longer be tolerated and encouraged, as much as the Democrats utilised these people as fodder for votes, those days are long gone. Look where it got Hillary? 
Mexico will be taxed to hell, and the illegals shipped to the border and thrown into the desert. Walk back to Mexico where you came from you dirty slickback they will say. 
If the blacks riot again, they will this time get a proper response, not the Obama response that was so prevalent during his tenure. There will be live ammo used on the blacks to put them firmly in their place. 
Anyone who says Trump is not establishment is wrong, he was not only born into the establishment but the people he knows are all establishment. One must remember that the establishment controls both sides of any argument, and whoever wins is always the establishment. 
When Trump met Kissinger, that was a clue that there was movement in his campaign, and this meeting alone should have signalled a change in sentiment amongst the controllers. 
The rhetoric used in Trump¡¯s acceptance speech was far removed from the braggadocio and fascism of his former speeches, this is because Trump can now bide his time, he will cut down the Muslims in his own time, he will make his mark on Saudi Arabia, and Iran, in his own time, that will come. If you are a devout Muslim in America and dress like one, you will be targeted soon, so it is in your best interests to either assimilate into the American ways of dress and habits or to leave. You will be targeted in the streets, and you will be hounded out of town. This is why you must leave now, or later on find yourself in a camp, similar to how the Japanese were treated in World War two. 
A great war is coming, and even though Putin and Trump may seem chummy now, there is one thing you must never do, and that is trust a Russian. It is an impossible feat in itself, because how can you trust something that moves from one side to the other so quickly? 
We must prepare, and we must look to places of safety far away from any civilisation or U.S. interests to find that safety as the war will be long and vicious, possibly nuclear. 
Kudos to Trump for winning, but where he touched Americans with his emotive rhetoric he has left a warning of the future, for without constraint and patience, there will be global war soon, and this is firmly within the establishment¡¯s agenda.

Many U.S. Muslims prefer Sharia law 
WASHINGTON D.C. ¨C USA ¨C President elect, Donald Trump has today made his plans for Muslims in America known to reporters. 

Donald Trump visited the White House today to meet with outgoing president Barack Hussein Obama on plans for the transference of power. To say the meeting was edgy and cold would be an understatement. 
Trump¡¯s landslide victory at the recent U.S. elections caught many off guard, and liberals are all still in deep shock that their delegate Hillary Clinton was not elected. 
After the meeting at the White House, when asked about Muslims, Trump was at first hesitant about revealing his plans, but then answered emphatically that Muslims are a danger to the national security of the nation. 
No Sharia 
¡°I have already spoken in depth about Muslims. Our solution will be humane and just. Their religion is abhorrent and cannot be trusted. We cannot trust Muslims in our cities, our streets, our jobs. Look what happened in the San Bernardino shooting or the Orlando massacre? These atrocities were all committed by Muslims on U.S. citizens going about their daily lives. We can¡¯t have this savagery amongst us. That¡¯s why I¡¯m calling for every Muslim to be registered in a database. We need to find out who the devout ones are, who the others are. We need to know if they own guns, and we need to stop their permits. We need to know and watch every Muslim in this country, and when the time comes I will make the final decision. We need to detain them until all the attacks stop. Detain or deport. We¡¯ll give them a choice. Let¡¯s not forget their mosques either, shut them down, we can and will do that. They have no place in America, a Christian God loving country.¡± 
Another reporter asked about Muslims who wish to visit the United States. 
¡°It¡¯s common sense. We have no choice. There is already a no-fly list in place for known terrorists and criminals. Our policy in the name of Homeland Security will be that all Muslims are potential terrorists. Until the war of terror is over, this will be our policy. They can go and visit some other country, but Muslims will not be welcome in America while I am president.¡± 
As reporters rushed to ask further questions, Trump halted them and moved on with his entourage. 
There are fears for many Muslims in America today, as attacks on their person have risen by 25% already since Trump¡¯s election victory. Many are now making plans to leave of their own volition.

WASHINGTON D.C. ¨C USA ¨C America is dawning on a new era, a new volksgemeinschaft as proposed by its charismatic leader Donald Trump, a man with deep Germanic roots, and a vision that brings forth strength through Aryan supremacy. 


Already the troops and militia have been designated zones specific to their skills, and the plans to move forward in purging the swamp that is America today, will be conducted with great haste and urgency. 
Having pulled off a great feat through a general election, the Trump movement has followed a legitimate legal path to power, and have not utilised the violence of previous fascist movements to gain power. 
¡°We had to gain power through the legal American constitution, and once in power we will need to unite the American people under a singular cause. As much of a Pearl Harbor event, a 911, or Reichstag fire on 27 February 1933, this event we are waiting for will be cataclysmic and a profound unitary force amongst the population,¡± a Trump adjutant, revealed on Thursday. 
Unity in the American people is key, as there are many elements within the populace who do not wish for Trump and his movement to be in power. There will be a purge of the system immediately after inauguration, and all negative elements will be flushed away back into the sewer. 
The Bolsheviks within American politics and society have been routed in the general election, however there are many elements still at hand, lest we forget the Marxist socialist swine Soros and his cohorts of troublemakers. This is why Trump is mobilising the Einsatzgruppen to counteract this threat and to neutralise it once and for all. 
As in every fascist movement, there always has to be a common enemy, and these are primarily Muslims, who are now the new Jews, and after many years of media incitement and hatred sanctioned by governments worldwide, as well as engineered atrocities in the name of that religion carried out by black operation sanctioned Jihadists, the Trump movement has a very explosive adversary. 
Illegal immigrants, are also to be designated as Untermenschen, and designated a common enemy to the American people. 
In accordance with the American constitution, the new president will adhere to the constitution by amending it for his needs. This change will be necessary for the survival of the American Aryan cause, and will be administered as a new improved constitution, a new American Reich for the next thousand years.

ARIZONA ¨C USA ¨C As the Obama administration encouraged illegal immigrants to come over the border, Donald Trump wants to stop this, and send them back. 

Thanks to Obama¡¯s initiative to acquire a database of illegal immigrants in America, and a pledge of amnesty , which allowed many to sign up, Donald Trump now has a complete list of people to be deported from America. 
Every year many people try to gain entry into the United States utilising legal channels of entry, and millions are denied. It is therefore wrong that many others who wish to come to America can just walk across a border, and were encouraged to do so under the Obama administration. 
Trump has already outlined a plan to deport 2-3 million illegals who arrived illegally from South American countries and who pose a serious danger to the populace. The deportation of illegals with criminal records and links to gangs will be a first step, however there are still approximately 12 million known illegal aliens residing within the U.S.¡¯s border, and these will be rounded up and deported in the next year or so. 
The logistics of rounding up these people and putting them on secure buses back to the border will be enormous. Some advisers are saying that there will be elements who try and flee from immigration control officers, however, they will have no place to go. They will not be able to work, or rent out a place to sleep, once they are caught they too will be rounded up and thrown out of the country. 
Many illegal immigrants are now going underground or fleeing back across the border, so Trump has a big job in front of him, that is if he does not go back on his word.

alt-right conference in Washington, D.C., where Trump¡¯s victory was met with cheers and Nazi salutes 
WASHINGTON D.C. ¨C USA ¨C During Trump¡¯s rise to power as the next president of the United States, he said what the fascist alt-right wanted to hear, then once in power, he disavowed them. 


Trump quite cleverly used the alt-right chump votes to gain power, but now that he is on the cusp of becoming president, Trump is dumping his voters for a more diplomatic stance in rhetoric. 
So, why did you do it? Quite simply, the alt-right, is a white supremacist fascist movement , and even though Trump may still hold fascistic viewpoints, his advisers have probably told him that he needs to tone down his nasty words a little. 
Chumps 
The alt-right vote was a surefire winner for Trump, purely because the followers would be guaranteed to vote for Trump, they are fanatical in their cause, and were fooled very easily into voting for Trump. 
As much as Trump courted the Ku Klux Klan, and other white supremacist Christian groups during his campaign he knew one thing that Hillary did not, and that is these are the silent ostracised groups within America who are guaranteed to vote for something other than an all inclusive democrat. 
There are many now within the alt-right fascist movement who feel angered about being used by Trump, but that¡¯s chumps for you, Trump was the player business man who used these easily acquiesced pawns, then dumped the dumb suckers. 
Now that he got their vote, he is quietly disavowing them, and moving towards a more temperate pasture of vocal rhetoric.

Donald Trumpa??s star on the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker wielding a sledgehammer and pickax. The man, who told Deadline his name was Jamie Otis, said he was trying to extract the star to auction it off and raise funds for the women who have come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them over the decades. 
The embedded terrazzo and brass star, dedicated in 2007 in recognition of the now-GOP presidential candidatea??s days as host of NBCa??s The Apprentice, was smashed to bits, with shrapnel flying everywhere in the early-morning hours at the stara??s sidewalk home at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. near the Dolby Theatre. Check out Deadlinea??s exclusive video above. 
The incident occurred around 5:45 AM with a few bystanders stopping to watch. An LAPD police cruiser showed up around 6:15, but Otis already had left the scene. 
He wanted to give money to lying sluts. 
smdh. 
None of these stupid bitches have any evidence for their retarded claims. And they must have been put up to this by someone agreeing to pay their legal fees, because they¡¯re all going to get sued, whether Trump wins or loses. 
And this man wants to give them free money. Just because. My princesses. 
The Evolutionary Roots of White-Knighting 
White-knighting has a biological explanation. Women have far more reproductive value than men do. And they are productive for a much shorter period of time. So a young fertile woman is of extreme value to the tribe, the nation, the race. This is why we all have these super-strong instincts to protect women. 
Technically, a society where the overwhelming majority of men had been killed, but the women were still alive, could recuperate. It takes a man five minutes to produce a child, while it takes a woman about three years (from conception to the point where it could exist without its mother). 
So, in a naturally functioning society, the white knight instinct is a good thing. 
However, we don¡¯t live in naturally functioning society. We live in a totally jewed-out nightmare dystopia where nature itself has been turned on its head and women have been given authority to rule over men. We have also been systematically brainwashed to believe that women are the same as men, and thus possess a similar morality to men ¨C for example, we are taught that women don¡¯t lie constantly as a matter of course (they do), we are taught that they have the capacity to feel guilt (they don¡¯t, they only feel shame) and we are taught that they can use logic to evaluate situations (they can¡¯t). 
Basically, women do not have the physical strength to acquire necessary physical resources, so they have to use other methods to get what they need. 
Historically, though there was always a strong desire to protect women, women were not considered an authority on reality and there was an understanding that the basic biological nature of women is to survive on lies, manipulation and various schemes. So, while we would certainly hang a rapist if we found a rapist to have violently raped a woman, we didn¡¯t take women at their word whenever they said anything. 
We also didn¡¯t have these new forms of rape, such as ¡°date rape.¡± If a woman went to the cops and said ¡°I was in this man¡¯s bedroom and he raped me,¡± the cops would say ¡°well what were you doing in his room? Did he kidnap you?¡± 
We also would have been extremely skeptical of women accusing a rich man of sexual impropriety, as it is clear she has a whole lot to gain from doing so. 
So, even while the natural instinct is to come rushing in like a valiant knight whenever a woman cries that a man has disrespected her honor, this instinct was tempered by a logical understanding of the natural behavior of women. 
Another interesting element here worth noting is that while alpha males are much less prone to take the histrionics of women seriously, it is not because alpha males have less of a drive to protect women. It is because alpha males generally have more experience with women, and are thus much more likely to be aware of their tricks. Beta males also have the (presumably subconscious) belief that white-knighting will get them laid (protip: it does not), but this is also mainly due to a lack of understanding of female behavior due to a lack of exposure. 
There is also the fact that beta males have less testosterone, generally, and so are more likely to associate with females. You will notice that men who have ¡°female friends¡± that they are not having sex with or trying to have sex with tend to be non-masculine. You also find this among men who will spend too much time with their girlfriends. 
Men who take the opinions of women seriously on any level whatsoever tend to exhibit signs of femininity. For masculine men, a woman expressing her opinion on anything is either cute or repulsive. 
Maximizing Male Exploitation 
Women instinctively understand this current backward situation, and are using it to maximum effect. Historically, women would have been ashamed to do what they are doing now. But because they know they can get away with it ¨C and they know society won¡¯t shame them ¨C they are pushing it as far as they possibly can. 
And that is what we see with the Clinton campaign¡¯s use of these ¡°woman abuser¡± allegations against Trump.

Basically, we¡¯ve got a Road Runner vs Wile E. Coyote situation going on here. 
The West just keeps coming-up with these elaborate, stupid schemes and Russia plows right past them. 
I am really not sure that the West understands exactly what they¡¯ve gotten themselves into here. 
RT : 
Russian strategic missile troops reportedly launched an RS-18 ballistic missile on Tuesday. The launch may have been a test of the advanced hypersonic glider warhead, which would be able to defeat US anti-missile systems. 
The test was conducted at midday from a site near the town of Yasny, Orenburg region, in the southern Urals, and the warhead reached the Kura test range in Kamchatka in Russiaa??s Far East. 
a??The test was a success. The warhead was delivered to Kura field,a?? the Defense Ministry reported. 
Popular defense blog MilitaryRussia.ru says the launch was meant to test Russiaa??s hypersonic glider warhead, currently known by its developer designation, a??object 4202a??, or Aeroballistic Hypersonic Warhead. 
A select few countries are currently developing the technology. The US has the HTV-2, a device developed by DARPA that has two partially successful tests under its belt. The Chinese warhead using the same technology is called DF-ZF, with Beijing first confirming a test in 2014. India is also studying hypersonic flight technology, but unlike Russia, the US and China, it is reportedly not developing a strategic missile warhead. 
A hypersonic glider vehicle (HGV) is different from a conventional ballistic missile warhead in that it travels most of the time in the stratosphere rather than in space. It gives an HGV-tipped missile greater range and may give anti-missile systems a shorter window to respond to an attack. 
We are at a point in history where the American people are forced to make a decision.

In the twelve weeks since the party conventions concluded in late July, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has received significantly more broadcast network news coverage than his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, but nearly all of that coverage (91%) has been hostile, according to a new study by the Media Research Center (MRC). 
In addition, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump (440 minutes) than about similar controversies involving Clinton (185 minutes). Donald Trumpa??s treatment of women was given 102 minutes of evening news airtime, more than that allocated to discussing Clintona??s e-mail scandal (53 minutes) and the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play scandals (40 minutes) combined. 
For this study, the MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). The networks devoted 1,191 minutes to the presidential campaign during this period, or nearly 29 percent of all news coverage.

The US Presidential election ended yesterday. 
Little information has come out since I reported on the situation 20 or so hours ago. 
Both sides have demanded James Comey release more information, and he hasn¡¯t even made a public statement. 
But the situation is clear. 
Hillary Clinton is now facing certain indictment. There is simply no way this investigation would have been reopened 11 days before the election if that were not the case. We must not let #CrookedHillary take her CRIMINAL SCHEME into the Oval Office. #DrainTheSwamp pic.twitter.com/GtPkj4xIz6 
¡ª Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2016 
No one is going to vote for a Presidential candidate who may well be in prison a few weeks after she takes office. If they¡¯re continuing the investigation through November, she could well be locked-up before she has a chance to be sworn in. 
She is now nonviable. I half expect that they will pull her before Monday. Well, maybe not half-expect. Quarter-expect, perhaps. I don¡¯t even know if they¡¯re allowed to pull her at this point. I think they would have to put in Kaine. 
So far she¡¯s made only a three sentence comment on it, and her staff has said nothing but that the FBI needs to explain more. Basically, they appear to believe they still own the FBI. But if they did own the FBI right now, this wouldn¡¯t have happened. There¡¯s no way. 
The most logical analysis I have seen is that the agents of the FBI were revolting because of Comey¡¯s criminal collusion, and they exerted some form of pressure on him. I¡¯m not sure what form of pressure they would have that would carry more weight than the pressure Hillary has. 
Basically, we¡¯ve witnessed Kek intervention. 
A lot of people were saying Trump was going to win no matter what, and I kept that face up on the site. But tbh fam, I was a bit worried. They are going to have all these illegals voting, which will make a difference. They¡¯re going to do bussing. etc. 
Trump could contest it, but his only real leverage would be to threaten a putsch. And though I love this idea, I¡¯m not 100% sure it would have actually happened. 
But now, none of that matters. 
Because not even the kike media can continue portraying Hillary as a viable candidate. 
We¡¯ve won, brothers. 
All of our hard work this year has paid off. 
And make no mistake ¨C every meme you posted, every comments section you trolled ¨C all of that is what made this happen. 
Kek sent us Trump. Sent the crazy old bastard right down an elevator into our laps. 
And then he said ¡°DO IT FAGGOTS.¡± 
And we did it. 
We memed Jeb into a character of an obsessive cuckold weirdo. 
We memed Ted Cruz into Lyin Ted Cruzman Sachs. 
We memed Hillary into a freefall collapse of Hillary on 9/11. 
And now we¡¯ve pulled-off the greatest meme of all time: 
They¡¯re going to lock her up. 
Take a bow, brothers. 
This is a small step for memes. But it is a giant leap for our agenda to secure a homeland for our people and a future for White children. 
I¡¯m still a little bit in shock. 
This joy that I feel ¨C I cannot describe it. 
There is actually a very decent chance that by November 9th, I will actually be tired of winning. 
In Conclusion 
Dear kikes: remember when I told you ¡°now is not the time for fear, that comes later?¡± 
Well. 
The night has never been darker and our enemies have never been closer. 
But lo, the people rejoice, and they sing songs of gladness. 
For The Don is rising. 
And soon, the swamp will be drained, and our enemies shall know justice.

On Thursday, on his daily podcast, Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro decimated HBO host and supposed comedian John Oliver for his comments regarding Donald Trump's comments on abortion during the third presidential debate. 
Shapiro began, ""HBO¡¯s John Oliver belongs to a class of British people who think that they are smarter than everyone else by dint of their accent. They think that because they share an accent with Rex Harrison from My Fair Lady this makes them geniuses."" 
He continued: 
So John Oliver does a political show on American politics; he doesn¡¯t know much about American politics; he doesn¡¯t know much about politics generally; but he¡¯s been feted by the media because he¡¯s a comedian who¡¯s wildly to the left. So just like President Obama is going to be interviewed by Samantha Bee, who is legitimately the least funny person in human history, (she and Trevor Noah actually have a cage match next week to determine who¡¯s the least funny person in human history. Both of them I believe, beat Stalin for that title a while back, so now were going to unify the championships), so Obama¡¯s going to be on with Samantha Bee, where presumably they will jabber about how much they love each other and why abortion¡¯s wonderful. 
John Oliver was ripping on Donald Trump the other day at some awards ceremony, and because he¡¯s British, that means we¡¯re supposed to pay attention to him, even though we fought a revolution so we wouldn¡¯t have to pay attention to the Brits. Here¡¯s John Oliver talking about abortion: 
The screen then showed Oliver pontificating: 
In terms of the communication about reproductive rights and the conversation that is so important; we really did potentially hit an idea in the modern era during that third debate because his discussions of late-term abortions showed no real understanding of how abortions work, no clear understanding of the basic biology of women¡¯s bodies, and a very poor sense of grammar as well. So I guess we got, in a sense, what we were asking for. If you ask Donald Trump to draw a Fallopian tube, I cannot imagine what you would get back other than a child¡¯s drawing of a cobra. 
Shapiro fired back: 
Okay. I would hesitate to ask John Oliver to draw a Fallopian tube or to describe any of the biology here, because he obviously doesn¡¯t know. Now look, I criticized Trump for being ignorant about how he described abortion because he wasn¡¯t graphic enough. But let me, for those who missed it, explain what exactly happens in a late-term abortion, which is what he was talking about, okay? What happens in a late-term abortion, what happens in a late-term abortion, is something completely awful; this is according to americanpregnancy.org., okay? Not a right-wing pro-life website: americanpregnancy.org: ""The fetus is rotated; forceps are used to grasp and pull the legs, shoulders and arms through the birth canal. A small incision is made at the base of the skull to allow a suction catheter inside. The catheter removes the cerebral material,¡± that would be the brains, ¡°until the skull collapses. The fetus is then completely removed.¡± 
Shapiro continued to explain the barbaric procedure: 
Okay, that¡¯s one procedure that¡¯s used; that¡¯s ¡°dilation and extraction.¡± In late-term abortions it usually one of these two; ¡°dilation and evacuation¡± or ¡°dilation and extraction.¡± ¡°Dilation and evacuation¡±: The baby may be given a lethal injection to kill it; sometimes they don¡¯t use such injections; then the doctor uses a curette or a forceps to carve up the child¡¯s body in the womb, and remove it piece by piece. 
Then he proceeded to carve up Oliver: 
So I guess that Donald Trump could have been more graphic; I don¡¯t know that John Oliver would have enjoyed that, but he could have been more graphic, I suppose. But this is what they do, laugh it up, ¡°Oh, he can¡¯t draw a Fallopian tube."" 
Okay, John: draw an abortion. Really. Draw it; let¡¯s see it. I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like. It¡¯s not waving a magic wand, and it¡¯s not getting rid of a cluster of cells that mean nothing. I want you to sit there and draw what it looks like when a baby is cut into pieces and removed from the womb. I would like to see that. ""Okay, John: draw an abortion. Really. Draw it; let¡¯s see it. I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like."" Ben Shapiro 
Shapiro concluded: 
But of course he¡¯ll never do that, other than, ""It might look like a cobra; it might look like a cobra; maybe it¡¯ll look like a princess, waving her fairy magic wand and a unicorn emerges from the vagina.¡± The fact that he thinks his accent covers for his basic ignorance of biology and his euphemistic willingness to ignore what amounts to child-killing is absolutely ridiculous and despicable.

Remington Research's summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become ""increasingly competitive"": 
Last week, we found a presidential race where Hillary Clinton held a clear advantage. This week, we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go. Trump appears to be holding strong in his must-win states and Colorado remains within the margin of error. The data also show that Pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category. 
¡°The presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch. Hillary maintains an advantage leading in Colorado and Pennsylvania, but at this point anything can happen,¡± said Titus Bond, Director of Remington Research Group 
Other state polling data came out on Sunday that also showed a close-race between Trump and Clinton, although the polls were surveyed before FBI director James Comey's announcement that they were re-opening their investigation against Clinton . Via RealClearPolitics : Florida: New York Times/Siena: Trump 46 percent, Clinton 42 percent. NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 45 percent, Trump 44 percent. Gravis: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 47 percent. Colorado: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 42 percent, Trump 39 percent. Arizona: CBS/YouGov: Trump 44 percent, Clinton 42 percent. North Carolina: NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 47 percent, Trump 41 percent. Gravis: Clinton 49 percent, Trump 47 percent. CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 45 percent. Pennsylvania: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 40 percent. 
The fact that some of these polls were close even before the Comey announcement led to this observation from FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver: Both things can be true: 1) Comey impact overblown ¡ª Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) October 31, 2016 
Radio host Steve Deace writes at Conservative Review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of Clinton, the renewed FBI investigation could ""have a potentially huge impact"" on Election Day: 
Trump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like Arizona, Georgia, Utah, Indiana, and Alaska that rarely go blue on Election Day. It¡¯s quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the Clintons could sway the bulk of Republican-leaning undecideds Trump¡¯s way. But that¡¯s provided, of course, that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as he¡¯s been prone to do. Then there¡¯s the matter of Trump¡¯s emerging Evan McMullin headache in Utah. 
If Trump can be disciplined this final week, his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on Iowa, Nevada, Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina. Those five states would get him within striking distance to 265 Electoral College votes, and then you hope you can pull an upset in Colorado, Pennsylvania, or New Mexico where Trump is visiting during the campaign¡¯s final week. The hope is that there¡¯s enough voters in those states wearier of Clinton¡¯s corruption than worried about whether Trump¡¯s fit for office. 
FiveThirtyEight currently has Trump's odds of winning the presidency at 23.6 percent in their polls-plus forecast. This week will be crucial for Trump in increasing those odds, and maybe the FBI's re-opened investigation into Clinton will help improve those odds as it becomes closer to Election Day.

Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at Hillary Clinton when it comes to her husband's escapades. ""The kitchen sink,"" in this case, is Jeffery Epstein's ¡°Sex Slave Island¡± and President Bill Clinton¡¯s ties to it . 
Why wouldn¡¯t Trump use this ammo? The answer is simple: Trump himself has ties to Epstein, the billionaire Democratic donor and convicted pedophile known for having under-age sex slaves on his private plane and what the media calls ""Sex Slave Island."" 
Here are seven connections between Trump and Epstein's sex slave endeavors that you need to know about: 
1. Trump himself has said that Epstein is ¡°a lot of fun to be with,¡± adding that he admired the sex offender's affinity for beautiful women ¡°on the younger side.¡± 
""I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump once said about the convicted sex offender. ""He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."" 
2. Trump was named in Epstein¡¯s ¡°little black book.¡± 
Epstein¡¯s ¡° little black book ¡± was stolen by a former employee in 2004. The book, nicknamed ""The Holy Grail"" by the employee, revealed the name of Donald Trump and listed ¡°14 phone numbers including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump's security guard and houseman.¡± 
3. Trump has allegedly flown on Epstein¡¯s private plane ¡ª a hot spot for under-age sex orgies. 
¡°Mark Epstein, Jeffrey's brother, testified in 2009 that Trump flew on Jeffrey's private jet at least once,¡± reports VICE News . ¡°Meanwhile, message pads [see below] from Epstein's Palm Beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by VICE News indicate that Trump called Epstein twice in November of 2004.¡± 
Epstein¡¯s private Boeing 727, according to one of his alleged victims, Virginia Roberts, was nicknamed the ¡°Lolita Express.¡± Roberts recalled ¡°unsavoury¡± sex orgies on the private plane when she was just 15 years of age with Epstein and his friends. 
4. Both Trump and Epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an under-aged girl. 
Radar Online reports that a woman in California, ¡°identified¡± as Katie Johnson, filed a $100 million lawsuit against Trump on April 26, accusing the real estate mogul of raping her when she was just 13 years old. 
Johnson ¡°claims Trump raped her when she was 13-years-old and forced her to engage in sex acts by threatening to harm her and her family,¡± notes The Independent UK . ¡°She claims the alleged abuse took place over a four-month period at underage sex parties held in New York City in 1994.¡± Epstein was also named for alleged sexual misconduct and threats. 
Trump¡¯s team adamantly denies the accusation, suspecting the claim is possibly a hoax since there is allegedly ¡°no evidence¡± the plaintiff ¡°actually exists.¡± 
5. Epstein admitted to knowing Trump under oath, and curiously pled the fifth to Trump attending sex parties with underage girls. 
Back in 2010, Epstein admitted to ¡°socializing¡± with Trump, but when a lawyer representing an under-aged victim of Epstein¡¯s asked if he has ¡°ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18,¡± Epstein curiously pled the Fifth. Per Vice News : Q: Have you ever had a personal relationship with Donald Trump? A. What do you mean by ""personal relationship,"" sir? Q. Have you socialized with him? A. Yes, sir. Q. Yes? A. Yes, sir. Q. Have you ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18? A: Though I'd like to answer that question, at least today I'm going to have to assert my Fifth, Sixth, and 14th Amendment rights, sir. 
6. At least one of Epstein¡¯s underage sex victims was recruited from Trump¡¯s Mar-a-Lago ¡ª which he frequented often. 
Virginia Roberts, an alleged victim of Epstein¡¯s, ""was recruited to perform a massage for Epstein while working as a $9-per-hour locker room attendant at Mar-A-Lago.¡± 
Roberts claims that ¡°Epstein turned her into a ¡®sex slave¡¯ and pimped her out to various friends, including England's Prince Andrew. Over the years, the passengers on Epstein's jet, she said, included ¡®a whole bunch of other girls, sometimes famous people, sometimes some politicians.'"" 
7. Trump was subpoenaed in 2009 for his connection to Epstein¡¯s under-age sex slave rings. Trump has denied ever being served. 
In 2009, Trump was subpoenaed in a case against Epstein concerning victim Virginia Roberts. Trump's attorney Alan Garten said that the subpoena ""never happened."" 
""There is no debate over what happened,"" said one of Roberts' attorneys. ""I served Mr. Trump with a subpoena for deposition in 2009. He talked to me voluntarily, and consequently we withdrew the subpoena in light of his voluntarily providing information¡­. I can't imagine there being any dispute of any of this."" 
Additionally, Garten told VICE News in January that Mr. Trump has ""no relationship"" with Epstein other than the Democratic donor frequenting Trump's Mar-A-Lago. ""A lot of people hung out there, including Jeffrey Epstein,"" said Garten. ""That is the only connection."" 
According to the evidence, however, the connections with Epstein appear to go a lot deeper than that.

The morally dark Obama-era is over and utterly and totally repudiated. The Clintons have finally and forever been staked in their mercenary black hearts. Our smug, supremacist overlords in the Elite Establishment of both Parties, these rotting, rent-seeking parasites, are now vanquished. But nothing is grander, nothing is more glorious, nothing is more satisfying, nothing is sweeter, nothing is more validating, nothing is better for America than the death of the mainstream media's political power. 
The elite national political media is done as a force, moral or otherwise, in this country. Done. Buried. Exposed. Over. Out. And using a slow-acting poison called hubris, it was death by suicide. So smug. So sure of themselves. So sanctimonious. So snark-filled. So utterly incapable of anything close to self-reflection. 
The self-induced poison took effect over a number of years and through five steps. 
Here they are. 
1. Pimping for ObamaCare 
The national political media didn¡¯t just cheerlead for ObamaCare, they LIED to us. Willfully and with malicious intent, they all lied to us. The outlawing of almost every existing insurance plan was right there in the bill, right there in black and white. But the media didn't care. They wanted to give their Precious Obama a win and in order to do that, they jumped on board the ""You Can Keep Your Insurance"" propaganda express. Worse, those of us who did tell the truth were branded as liars and racists, not only by the pundits but by those godforsaken fact-checkers. 
Then Utopia met reality. 
Then the lies were exposed. 
And the result is that up to and including last night, at both the local and national level, ObamaCare has decimated the Democrat Party. But nowhere near as bad as it has decimated the middle class. 
The media's role in this is unforgivable and destroyed whatever remained of their moral authority. From here on, they could only get more sweaty, desperate, and dangerous. 
2. Casting off Every Journalistic Ethic to Destroy Trump 
Openly, proudly, and belligerently, in order to hijack a presidential election, we were treated to the Pompous Announcement that Trump was such a threat to humanity, it was now time for journalists throughout the land to cast off every standard that makes journalism journalism, starting with objectivity. 
Even former good guys like CNN's Jake Tapper morphed into an unrecognizable LyingSnarkVirtueSignalingMachines -- another rotting cog in the Narrative Wheel, a mindless member of a self-deluded, government-worshiping cult that wouldn¡¯t piss on Middle America if we were on fire. 
Professional sobriety was cast off because this one was in the bag, baby! And who could miss the historic opportunity to self-righteously point-and-laugh at the hideous rubes as they were finally and forever being buried alive under a Brave New World. 
3. Grind Donald Trump To Dust 
While there is no question Trump deserved a few of the kitchen sinks hurled his way, never in my 50 years have I seen such a coordinated, desperate, dishonest, and poisonous campaign to disqualify a human being through the dark art of stripping him and his supporters of all their humanity. 
4. Embracing Confirmation Bias 
The longer the general election rolled on, the smaller the bubble of self-delusion became. 
Inconvenient polls were sneered at and Voxsplained away. 
Exit polls could only means ONE thing, even though it was pretty clear they might mean another. 
My personal favorite was the late editorials where, based on no counted votes whatsoever, we were trolled with the news that it was Hillary, not Trump, who would emerge victorious with the ""hidden vote!"" Oh, the delicious irony of that. Oh, how lovely it would be to rub that in the rubes' faces on Election Night. 
By the time the votes were actually being counted, I was about 60% sure Hillary would win. The New York Times, however, was 92% sure. ABCNBCCBSAPBSNPRCNNWashingtonPostPolitico were 100% sure. 
But even I understood that state and local polls were more erratic than ever, that Hillary did seem legitimately freaked about the upper Midwest, that the best pollster in the country had Trump up +2, that Trump never lost his fervent base, that the right track/wrong track numbers had been upside down for a decade, that there was still a larger-than-usual number of undecideds, that this thing that was Real might not be enough to win, but it was still Real. 
No, no, we were told, it's all smoke and mirrors, all gold-leafed Trump Steaks. Look at Obama's approval ratings! Look at the Hispanic vote! Look at this squirrel and that squirrel and the other squirrel over there. Sit down, son, don¡¯t you understand that I'm a data machine? It's science, rube. Don't you Vox, racist? 
And then the worst thing imaginable happened¡­. 
5. The Media Lost the Election 
The hate, the lies, the removal of the mask of objectivity, the pushing of every single chip into the middle of the table -- that can actually work ¡­ IF YOU WIN. 
But the media didn¡¯t win. 
In the most spectacular fashion, with their pants down and their bare ass hanging out for the world to see, they lost. 
And with that loss went EVERYTHING. 
And now the media is exposed in front of the whole world as a Swaggering Potemkin Bully that no longer has the power to sway public opinion, even when they throw absolutely everything they have at one man, and do so with much of the Republican Party on their side. 
Not only has the media forever been exposed as brazenly dishonest and laughably out of touch, worse than all that, they are exposed as WEAK, a force no one need ever fear or kowtow to again. 
Without that sheen of fear, without that threat of intimidation, like a vanquished bully, so goes all their power. 
F*** you, mainstream media. 
-- 
The delicious irony of all this is that the last desperate gasp of the political media did actually prove their precious Barack Obama correct about one thing¡­ 
The moral arc of history does indeed bend towards justice.

A YouTube video that's making the rounds appears to show a man being beaten and robbed in the middle of the street by a group laughing and shouting that he voted for Trump. 
In the clip (below), what appears to be a middle-aged white man is on the ground while two younger black males are hitting and kicking him in the head. The camera person yells, ""Happens when you vote Trump, dummy,"" while a woman next to him shouts, ""You voted Trump? You voted Trump? Damn! Yeah, he voted Trump! Damn!"" 


The man continues to struggle against his two attackers until he gets up and sees that a woman, presumably associated with the attackers, is going through the his car looking for valuables. 
""Get out of my car,"" the man yells as he approaches the women, who shouts back, ""You're gonna pay for my shit!"" One of the attackers returns and starts punching the man from behind in the back of the head and then continues swinging as the man turns around. 
The camera man and his companion continue their color commentary by laughing and yelling, ""Beat his ass! Don't vote Trump! Don't vote Trump!"" 
The video ends with the group acknowledging that they should leave before the police arrive. 
In the longer version of the video (below) posted on Twitter, one of the attackers gets into the driver's seat and closes the door. The beaten Trump supporter stands at the car window, presumably telling the thief to get out, as the woman starts to punch him in the back of the head and is joined by the second attacker. 
The criminal then hits the gas and takes off in the car as the man desperately holds on from outside through the rear door's window while being dragged through the streets.

President-elect Donald Trump. That is still a term that is surreal to a lot of people, as he was not expected to win on Tuesday. What were the driving factors that propelled Trump to the presidency? How was he able to pull off such a stunning upset? 
Here are seven reasons why Trump won. 
1. Hillary Clinton was unable to get the minority vote to turn out for her. Last night, Dems were calling the race a ""Whitelash"" -- wrong. Mitt won 59% of white vote, Trump won 58%. Minority voters didn't turn out. ¡ª David French (@DavidAFrench) November 9, 2016 
In fact, Trump was able to get a larger share of the minority vote than Mitt Romney did in 2012, as the Daily Wire has explained : 
Unsurprisingly, Trump lost to Clinton in the Latino and black votes by margins of 88 percent to 8 percent and 65 percent and 29 percent, respectively. Surprisingly, this was better than Romney fared among the aforementioned demographics in 2012, as he lost both groups by margins of 93 percent to 7 percent and 71 percent to 27 percent, respectively 
Michael Barone has noted that ""turnout fell in heavily black Philadelphia, Cleveland, Detroit, and Milwaukee. Millennial generation turnout was tepid, and Trump carried white Millennials by 5 points."" 
The enthusiasm was just not there for Clinton. 
2. Trump was able to pull in former Obama voters. According to the Washington Post , Trump was able to win over one-third of the 700 counties that went for Obama twice. Clinton was only able to win six of the 2,200 counties that didn't go for Obama. Trump was better at obtaining crossover voters than Clinton was. 
So who are these former Obama voters who voted for Trump in 2016, and what caused them to switch? 
3. These former Obama voters felt that Trump cared about them, and the Democrat Party did not. John Daniel Davidson explains in The Federalist that Clinton and the Democrat Party took the blue-collar, working class whites in the Rust Belt for granted¨Cexemplified by Clinton's pledge ""to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business""¨Cand it was to their detriment. The Rust Belt has been in economic decline for years, but it has suffered greatly from the Obama administration's regulations towards coal. 
While the Democrats wrote off the Rust Belt, Trump actually acknowledged their struggles, and that was all it took. 
""Trump was the first national political figure in generations who saw them, acknowledged that they have been left behind, that their cities and towns are in a state of persistent decline, and promised to help out somehow,"" writes Davidson. ""When you¡¯re used to being dismissed as bitter folks who cling to guns and religion, as President Obama did in 2008, or denounced as 'deplorables' and 'irredeemable,' as Hillary Clinton did during this election, respect goes a long way¡ªeven if there are no easy solutions, from Washington or anywhere else, to the problems that plague your town."" 
4. The FBI re-opening its investigation into Hillary's emails helped Trump. Per RedState , author Ed Klein said on the Steve Malzberg Show that Clinton was sobbing ""inconsolably"" on election night and was blaming FBI director James Comey re-opening the investigation as well as Obama for not stopping the investigation as to why she lost. 
There's no question that the re-opening of the investigation did considerably help Trump, as the polls severely tightened after the announcement. Poll numbers showed that the vast majority of Americans felt that Hillary was acting in an immoral manner. The spotlight was off of Trump's vulgar comments towards women and his sexual assault accusers, and instead the focus was on Clinton's private email server. But Clinton is leaving out one major person who is responsible for her loss... 
5. Hillary was a terrible candidate. If Clinton had been elected president, she would have been the first elected president to have been the subject of numerous FBI investigations. She broke the law by using her private email server to conduct official State Department business and there was a lot of quid pro quo that occurred at the Clinton Foundation . Clinton is robotic and devoid of charisma with a record in politics that is short of accomplishments but rich in failure, sleaze, and corruption. Basically, Clinton is ""an Obama Democrat without Obama's charm,"" according to Jonah Goldberg . 
She may have been the only Democratic candidate that could lose to Trump, and the Democrats wanted to coronate her from the beginning. They have no one to blame but themselves for President Trump. 
6. The public no longer has any faith in the media¨Cand that includes late-night comics. Will Rahn wrote at CBS News that the ""unbearable smugness"" of the Clinton-biased media was off-putting to a lot of voters, as they sneered at Trump supporters as stupid backward hicks while doing everything they could to prop up Clinton. Trump's vitriol toward the press ended up benefiting him politically. Poll numbers reflect this, as trust in the media has declined over the years. Rahn explains: 
Journalists increasingly don¡¯t even believe in the possibility of reasoned disagreement, and as such ascribe cynical motives to those who think about things a different way. We see this in the ongoing veneration of ¡°facts,¡± the ones peddled by explainer websites and data journalists who believe themselves to be curiously post-ideological. 
That the explainers and data journalists so frequently get things hilariously wrong never invites the soul-searching you¡¯d think it would. Instead, it all just somehow leads us to more smugness, more meanness, more certainty from the reporters and pundits. Faced with defeat, we retreat further into our bubble, assumptions left unchecked. No, it¡¯s the voters who are wrong. 
As a direct result, we get it wrong with greater frequency. Out on the road, we forget to ask the right questions. We can¡¯t even imagine the right question. We go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases. The public¡¯s estimation of the press declines even further -- fewer than one-in-three Americans trust the press, per Gallup -- which starts the cycle anew. 
The same applies to late-night comics. Mollie Hemingway writes in The Federalist that Jon Stewart is partly responsible for the election of Trump because of how he single-handedly destroyed CNN's Crossfire, resulting in ""a new age of hyper-political, hyper-liberal late-night comedy."" Stewart's The Daily Show spawned Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Trevor Noah and several other lefty comics that perverted comedy into smarmy left-wing political lectures talking down to conservatives. 
""Jon Stewart is known for brutally deriding a show that featured people of differing views civilly discussing issues of the day,"" writes Hemingway. ""He got that show killed and significantly strengthened the world where cultural elites engaged in groupthink mockery of those with whom they disagree. The results include a further erosion of civility, a decrease in Americans¡¯ ability to understand each other and their concerns, and, of all things, President-elect Donald Trump."" 
Which all culminates into the main reason why Trump was elected... 
7. Americans are tired of being trashed by leftist elites. Ben Shapiro explains : 
Trump won because many Americans were sick of being told that they were the racists as Barack Obama and his Department of Justice stoked race riots in major cities around the country. 
Trump won because many Americans were sick of watching other Americans being destroyed for their supposed intolerance ¨C for their religious beliefs, for their unwillingness to label women men and men women, for their support for traditional marriage or conservative political candidates. 
Trump won because many Americans were tired of the media¡¯s constant harping on America¡¯s flaws ¨C we were supposedly sexist, racist, and homophobic. Americans said that they did not believe the media, and they were right to do so. 
In other words, the left has been tearing down America as a country infested with intolerant, prejudicial bigots who are incapable of thinking for themselves and needed to rely on them on how to live their lives. The people finally had had enough, so they elected the man whom they felt best stuck it to the leftist elites.

During an interview with Lesley Stahl for 60 Minutes , which will air in its entirety Sunday night, Donald Trump began to walk back his campaign promise regarding the deportation of illegal immigrants: 
""We are getting them out of our country,"" the president elect said about the several million illegal immigrants with serious criminal records. ""After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people you're talking about who are terrific people, they're terrific people who we're going to make a determination on, but before we make a determination, we want to secure our border."" 
Gasp. 
Donald Trump rose to political fame on the back of his strong stance on illegal immigration. Throughout the primary process, he promised a "" deportation force ,"" telling MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski in November 2015: 
""You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely. Don't forget, Mika, that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and they're waiting to come in legally. And I always say the wall, we're going to build the wall. It's going to be a real deal. It's going to be a real wall."" 
In August, Trump delivered a major immigration speech in Phoenix, Arizona, in which he softened his stance a bit, focusing on illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes: 
""Within ICE, I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice."" 
He then added that ""anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don¡¯t have a country."" 
During the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, Trump reiterated his position against amnesty: 
""Well, first of all, [Clinton] wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders."" 
For Trump diehards, these statements were enough. Their guy was going to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, and no one would tell them otherwise. However, as anyone with access to Google should know, the president elect has long supported amnesty in some fashion. 
In July 2015, Donald Trump told CNN's Dana Bash: 
""I would get people out and then have an expedited way of getting them back into the country so they can be legal¡­A lot of these people are helping us¡­and sometimes it¡¯s jobs a citizen of the United States doesn¡¯t want to do. I want to move ¡¯em out, and we¡¯re going to move ¡¯em back in and let them be legal."" 
What Trump was talking about is known as ""touchback amnesty."" Such a plan would indeed involve the deportation of illegal immigrants, but allow them an expedited means of returning to the United States in order to obtain legal status. In other words, they touch base in their home country, then come right back. 
In November 2015, Eric Trump repeated his father's plan during an interview with Fox News' Megyn Kelly: 
""The point isn¡¯t just deporting them, it¡¯s deporting them and letting them back in legally. He¡¯s been so clear about that and I know the liberal media wants to misconstrue it, but its deporting them and letting them back legally."" 
Going back further, Trump's support for amnesty is even more stark. Speaking on Fox & Friends in 2012, he said: 
""For people that have been here for years that have been hard-workers, have good jobs, they¡¯re supporting their family¨Cit¡¯s very, very tough to just say ¡®By the way, 22 years, you have to leave. Get out¡¯¡­I¡¯m one of the world¡¯s very conservative people, but I have to tell you on a human basis, how do you throw somebody out that¡¯s lived in this country for twenty years?"" 
During the 2012 presidential election cycle, Trump even called Mitt Romney's idea of self-deportation "" maniacal ,"" and remarked that Republican Party policy toward illegal immigrants was "" mean-spirited ."" 
Donald Trump is a man who will say whatever he needs to in order to win. Now that he has won, he's already backtracking on multiple campaign promises, from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to the deportation of illegal immigrants.

I Just Hate You. | Daily Wire,"The Left Says I Hate Myself For Voting Trump While Female. I Don't. I Just Hate You. By: Amanda Prestigiacomo November 17, 2016 
As a woman who rejects third-wave feminism with the burning passion of a thousand suns on a regular basis, I've had my fair share of feminists tell me that I only reject them and their ideas because I suffer from ""internalized misogyny,"" or, in other words, I'm a self-loathing sexist. 
Here's exactly how Everyday Feminism defines ""internalized misogyny,"" if you're unfamiliar with bats*** crazy: 
Internalized misogyny, by definition, is sexism turned inward toward ourselves and outward toward other women. 
It becomes innate as we are socialized to the norms of our culture that indicate, overtly and covertly, that women are less than men ¨C less worthy, less strong, less dependable, less able, less of a leader, less logical ¨C while also more than men: more emotional, more irrational, more complex, more to manage. 
Of course, this is ridiculous, and I gave such an assertion about as much time as a I would a male feminist hitting on me: zero seconds. 
But on Wednesday, I learned that Team Hillary, the political left, likewise thought me a self-loathing sexist who passed on my obligation to vote for Queen Pantsuit because I couldn't stomach the thought of a powerful woman, since I apparently believe women are lessers. In fact, I¡ªa woman with a chronic case of ""internalized misogyny¡±¡ªcost Hillary the election; not her decision to engage in potentially criminal activity, nor her inability to campaign her way out of a paper bag. It was my fault.

Yeah, no. I didn't pull the lever for Trump because I hate myself. I don't. Not even a little actually. I just hate you. 
Let me define ""you."" 
""You"" are the feminists who contend my uterus must dictate all my choices; those who make it their mission to drag down any woman who has the audacity to veer from your ideology one iota. 
""You"" are the feminists who tell me that there's a special place in hell for me if I don't cast my ballot for Crooked Hillary. (Like all of a sudden feminists believe in God and an afterlife. LOL.) 
""You"" are the feminists who tell me I'm super mean and *shame* women when I point out that bragging about murdering unborn babies is gross and despicable. By the way, it is gross and despicable . 
""You"" are the feminists who demonize men with think-pieces on how and why we should banish so-called "" toxic masculinity "" from this world. 
""You"" are the feminists who shut men up because of their gender while simultaneously telling me gender is a social construct. And no, I will not cater to your preferred pronouns, you entitled brat. (Pro-tip: Once the number of genders you've made-up passes the number of flavors at Baskin Robbins, it's time to admit you have a problem.) 
""You"" are the social justice warriors who tell me I'm a hateful, selfish, capitalistic pig from your iPhone at your local safe space, equipped with coloring books, bubbles and puppies, across from the Starbucks you work weekends at. 
""You"" are the social justice warriors who viciously riot when you don't get your way, meanwhile you're not even registered to vote . 
""You"" are the social justice warriors shouting-down any free speech which doesn't perfectly align with your ideology, ironically in the name of tolerance and inclusiveness. 
""You"" are the virtue-signaling celebrities who think I give a hoot about your political stance. Please, go ahead and move to Canada, no one will miss you. I certainly won't. 
""You"" are the mainstream media so desperate for your leftist narrative that you'll lie to the American people to advance it; so hell-bent on painting middle-America and Republicans as racist you'll frame actual policy discussions into a segment of ""Who's The Biggest Xenophobe: Republican Edition."" 
""You"" are the leftist telling me I'm a racist for not supporting the divisive hate group Black Lives Matter. First of all, it's mostly comprised of a bunch of loser white kids. Second of all, call me crazy, but once you start calling for and actually assassinating police officers , I'm out. I know, how *racist* of me. 
""You"" are leftists calling me an Islamophobe because I use the term ""radical Islam"" and resist an influx of refugees whom the FBI said we cannot properly vet pouring into our country. 
You see, this election had virtually nothing to do with Donald Trump¡ªI could take him or leave him¡ªand almost everything to do with you, the left. Trump was indeed a protest vote; he was a direct repudiation of everything you stand for and everything you tell me I should stand for by virtue of my uterus. 
So, no, I'm not a self-loathing victim of ""the patriarchy"" who passed on a vote for Hillary because she's a woman. I just hate you.

The media, desperately in search of a narrative to cast the incoming Trump administration as dangerously incompetent, are once again overplaying their hands. Instead of focusing on the nepotistic fact that Trump relies heavily on his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his daughter, Ivanka ¨C he invited them to a state meeting with Japan ¨C they¡¯re trying to claim that he just isn¡¯t moving fast enough on appointments. 
That¡¯s nuts. 
Barack Obama didn¡¯t name his picks for Secretary of State, Defense, or Attorney General until December 1, nearly a month after the November 4, 2008 election. George W. Bush didn¡¯t name his picks for State, Defense, or Attorney General until mid-December (December 16 for Colin Powell, December 28 for Donald Rumsfeld, December 22 for John Ashcroft). Bill Clinton didn¡¯t name his picks for those positions until at least December 22. George H.W. Bush was the fastest off the mark ¨C he named James Baker Secretary of State the day after the November 8 election. Ronald Reagan waited until December 11 to get started; Jimmy Carter waited until December 3. 
We¡¯re still waiting on Trump¡¯s State and Defense picks, but he¡¯s already out of the gate with Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General. It¡¯s November 17. 
The media are so eager to bury Trump¡¯s administration that they are falling all over themselves to do so. Instead of soberly covering potential problems with top level picks ¨C Steve Bannon, for example, is a rotten pick , but not because he¡¯s a racist or anti-Semite ¨C the media keep proclaiming THE END IS NEAR. This sort of alarmism doesn¡¯t convince Americans, who don¡¯t really see why there¡¯s any giant rush to appoint people who aren¡¯t going to be formally considered by the Senate until January 20 anyway. 
If this election was about repudiation of the media ¨C and it was ¨C the media aren¡¯t doing themselves any favors when they promulgate fact-free narratives while simultaneously attempting to label conservative outlets ¡°fake news.¡± For years, Americans have assumed that the leftist media are ladling them fake news each day.

President-elect Donald Trump has announced that his selection for attorney general is Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), who has long been a favorite of conservatives. The Democrats already have the long knives out for Sessions, spit-balling their usual accusations of racism¨Cwhich should indicate that Sessions will be an effective attorney general. 
Here are seven things you need to know about Sessions. 
1. Sessions has a 78 percent liberty score on Conservative Review . Sessions has been in the Senate for 20 years, and has been described by the Washington Times as ""a tea partier before the tea party was cool,"" per Conservative Review 's biography . 
2. Sessions has been one of the leaders in the Senate in fighting against amnesty. For instance, Sessions was among the most prominent members of the Senate leading the opposition to the Gang of Eight Bill. National Review , which dubbed Sessions ""amnesty's worst enemy,"" explained how Sessions would reveal ""true facts"" about the bill in an attempt to persuade some senators that hadn't decided how to vote on the legislation. Sessions and Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) would find other clever ways to oppose the bill, such as ""an amendment to a resolution honoring the late Latino union organizer Cesar Chavez"" in which Vitter noted Chavez's opposition to illegal immigration, putting Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) in ""an awkward position."" 
In 2015, Sessions introduced a bill that would overhaul the immigration system, according to Conservative Review : Overturned the Zadvydas v. Davis Supreme Court case that Obama is using as an excuse to release criminal aliens after six months of detention Explicitly deputized the states to enforce federal immigration law Eliminated sanctuary cities by cutting off DHS and DOJ law enforcement grants Expedited deportation of gang members Applied the ramifications of treating illegal aliens as criminal aliens to those convicted of drunk driving Clamped down on loopholes that allow legal immigrants who commit crimes to continue on the path to citizenship instead of getting deported (this would address cases like the legal immigrant who murdered the family in the Washington, D.C. ¡°mansion murders¡±) 
Sessions has also fought efforts to increase legal immigration, as he has railed against it as ""the primary source of low-wage immigration into the United States."" 
""What we need now is immigration moderation: slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together,"" Sessions wrote in a 2015 op-ed in the Washington Post . 
3. Sessions has also spearheaded efforts to crack down on budgetary issues. According to Conservative Review 's biography of Sessions: 
In January 2011, he was named Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee. In this capacity, he led the Republican charge against Majority Leader Harry Reid and Barack Obama for not offering a serious budget proposal, given that the Senate had not passed a budget since April 2009. He has fought guerilla warfare, often a lonely battle, against Democrats spending by raising budget point of orders against the breach of budget caps. He has even fought his own party when his office put out devastating research against the Ryan-Murray budget deal. Sessions has also been a strong leader on welfare reform and publishing studies and data on the extent of the welfare state. 
Sessions has voted against the TARP bailout, stimulus bills, and increases to the debt limit and has traveled through his state ""with charts warning of the United States' 'crippling' debt,"" per the Washington Post . 
4. Sessions endorsed Trump early on. To the surprise of many in the establishment, Sessions endorsed Trump in February, declaring , ""I believe we are on a movement that must not fade away. This is a campaign, this is a movement. The American people are not happy with their government."" 
It shouldn't have come as a surprise though, given Session's record on immigration and that Sessions tends to be more protectionist on trade. 
5. Sessions is well-liked by his Senate colleagues on a personal level. According to the Washington Post : 
""Say what you will about him,"" former longtime Senate Democratic communications aide Jim Manley told the Almanac of American Politics. ""He was always nice to [the late Ted] Kennedy and other Democrats as well."" 
Even people who have run against him have nice things to say about him. Stanley-Becker talked to Susan Parker, a Democrat who tried to unseat Sessions in 2002. During a debate, she asked for a tissue and Sessions handed her one. She joked she would use it to dry her eyes when Sessions made her cry, and he responded: ""Please don¡¯t say that. That¡¯s my nightmare. I promise I¡¯ll be nice."" 
It's no wonder then that Sessions will likely be confirmed by the Senate. 
6. Accusations of racism against Sessions are absurd. When President Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions, who at the time was a U.S. attorney, to a federal judge, the Democrats smeared Sessions with accusations of racism, which included: Calling a black attorney ""boy."" Quipping about the Ku Klux Klan: ""I used to think they were OK, but they are pot smokers."" Joking that a white attorney was ""a traitor to his race"" because he was collaborating with civil rights groups. Calling the NAACP and ACLU ""un-American."" Prosecuting a civil rights organization for voter fraud. 
The last point isn't racist at all. The jokes, as Ben Shapiro has written , were made ""in front of the black lawyer; even the lawyer accusing Sessions of racism acknowledged that Sessions was joking."" Clearly Sessions meant them as harmless jokes. Sessions has also denied calling the lawyer ""boy."" The civil rights group Sessions prosecuted has faced accusations of voter fraud for many years. 
Sessions' record on race actually shows that he has consistently fought against racism, as The Weekly Standard 's Mark Hemingway writes: 
As a U.S. Attorney he filed several cases to desegregate schools in Alabama. And he also prosecuted the head of the state Klan, Henry Francis Hays, for abducting and killing Michael Donald, a black teenager selected at random. Sessions insisted on the death penalty for Hays. When he was later elected the state Attorney General, Sessions followed through and made sure the Hays executed. The successful prosecution of Hays also led to a $7 million civil judgment against the Klan, effectively breaking the back of the KKK in Alabama. 
7. As attorney general, Sessions would uphold the rule of law. The reason why Sessions has been such an immigration hawk is that he supports the rule of law. He has also fought against judicial activist nominees and is a strong supporter of the death penalty. Between that and his legal background as a U.S. attorney and Alabama attorney general, there is every reason to believe that Sessions will follow the law and not politicize the Justice Department. 
""His interpretation of the law will not please everyone, but I predict it will be fairly applied without fear or favor,"" Robert Driscoll , former deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in National Review . ""Clear cases will be prosecuted with vigor.

Conversing with fellow Daily Show ¡°comic¡± John Oliver at the Montclair Film Festival on Saturday night, Late Show unfunny host Stephen Colbert admitted that he couldn¡¯t even conceive that Donald trump would win the presidency; so much so that he couldn¡¯t write jokes bout Trump winning for election night. 
In the roughly two-hour discussion and Q&A titled ¡°Wow, That Was Weird,¡± Montclair Film Festival executive director Tom Hall set the somber tone by allowing, ""When we planned this evening, I think we all thought we'd be looking back with laughter instead of looking forward with deep concern about the uncertainty we face."" 
Speaking of the Late Show ¡¯s Election Night special on Showtime, Colbert admitted that the staff was prepared for every result of the election except the one that actually transpired: 
There was not a bear big enough in the world that we weren't loaded for. We were so loaded for every possible eventuality. We had so many guests. We had so many pre-taped pieces, all based on a different eventuality. We had three shows: Hillary Clinton wins and we know; Hillary Clinton wins and we don¡¯t know, because it¡¯s not called before the show¡¯s over; Donald Trump's going to win and we don¡¯t know, because everyone said he had such a narrow path to victory. That's not wishful thinking, that's what everyone was saying. 
And then there was the last show, which is the show we did, which is Donald Trump is going to win and we know he's going to win. My execs and my writers were like, ¡°You don't want to write something for that?¡± and I'm like, ¡°No! There is nothing you can write. You don't understand. I have 400 people in my theater. If we know Donald Trump is going to win, it's going to be like doing stand-up comedy for one of those Chilean soccer stadiums where the villagers watch you execute one of the natives. There will be no laughter!¡± We only did about 20 minutes of material before we went, ¡°F¡ª it, it's going to be him, let's just talk for another hour.¡± So I think we have two and a half whole shows that you will never see of material that we had to kill that night. 
Colbert moaned that the special was ""the hardest thing I've ever done in my life,"" adding, ""I was tying my tie at 10:30 and I went, 'Oh, he took Ohio. Oh, well, we expected that. He took it by 11 points. Wow! That's not expected.' And then over my guests' shoulders, people kept holding up signs that said, 'Florida, Iowa, Nebraska.'"" He revealed that numerous fake commercials were prepared, but ""none of them were appropriate once we knew we were playing to an audience of the condemned. Our audience was sobbing openly. And those are people who work for me, like my cameramen."" 
As Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro pointed out years ago , Colbert's manipulative act has been laced with hatred of conservatives: 
He engages in Conservativeface. He needs no makeup or bulbous appendage to play a conservative ¨C after all, conservatives come in every shape and size. Instead, he acts as though he is a conservative ¨C an idiotic, racist, sexist, bigoted, brutal conservative. He out-Archie Bunkers Archie Bunker. His audience laughs and scoffs at brutal religious ¡°Colbert¡± who wishes to persecute gays; they chortle at evil sexist ¡°Colbert¡± who thinks men are victims of sexism. This is the purpose of Colbert¡¯s routine. His show is about pure hatred for conservatives in the same way that blackface was about pure hatred of blacks. In order to justify their racism, racists had to create a false perception of blacks; in the same way, Colbert and his audience can justify their racism only by creating a false perception of conservatives. 
On Saturday night, Colbert waxed eloquent over his fear of a Trump presidency, arguing, ""I¡¯m all for giving him a chance, but don¡¯t give him an inch. Because I believed everything he said, and I remember everything he said. And it¡¯s horrifying. It's possible. The job changes a man. That's the cliche of the presidency."" He pontificated: 
Every president tries to achieve what they promised and you can say, ¡°Well, there are levers of power in Washington that can slow him down.¡± But two things: One is they're cowards. Second is that the levers in Washington are apparently merely attached to blinking red lights that make the people happy when they pull. Because they tried to stop Trump. Everybody tried to stop Trump, do not delude yourself. 
Everyone except the people he's going to appoint tried to stop him and they didn't. He owes them nothing. He goes out on the balcony and he says to the crowd, ¡°Shall I do it?¡± And they say, '¡±Yes.¡± And he says, ¡°It shall be so.¡± And the balcony is Twitter. He goes onto Twitter and he goes, ¡°What do you think? Do you think I'm right?¡± That's what scares me, that he owes the checks and balances of Washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldn't. And he's a vindictive person. So it's all going to be fine. Merry Christmas. ¡°No! There is nothing you can write."" Stephen Colbert 
Colbert concluded, ""The next person who says to me, 'You must be happy on a certain level,¡¯ is going to have their eye carved out.¡±

With Donald Trump set to take office in a couple of months, a number of his lackeys have reportedly been in talks about possibly serving in the administration. As of this writing, there are three pro-Trump pundits that might be in the Trump administration. 
Eric Bolling. Politico reported that Bolling was seen at Trump Tower and was reportedly discussed for a position in the Department of Commerce. What exactly that position that will be is not clear. Bolling told Politico that he ""can't confirm anything."" 
Geraldo Rivera flat-out asked Bolling on The Five if he had been offered a job, and Bolling gave a non-answer . 
Bolling has been with Fox News since 2008, where he is the co-host of The Five and hosts the weekend show Cashin' In . Before then, he had been an analyst on CNBC and a New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) trader. Bolling has been an ardent supporter of Trump from the get-go, to the point where he resorted to some loony ideas . 
Laura Ingraham. According to CNN Money , Ingraham is being heavily considered for President Trump's press secretary. Here is what Ingraham has said on the matter: 
""I am honored to be considered for that job and other jobs. So we'll see what happens,"" Ingraham said on Fox News. 
She cautioned: ""I think people are getting a little far ahead of the narrative."" But she strongly suggested that some sort of Trump administration post is in the works. 
""It's a big decision, but I'm at the point where, if my country needs me, and if I can do something to actually, you know, advance the Trump agenda, which is stuff I have written about now for 15 years, with trade, immigration and just renewing America, then I obviously have to seriously consider that,"" she told Fox's Tucker Carlson. 
Like Bolling, Ingraham, who has been a nationally syndicated radio host since 2001 , has also been an early supporter of Trump, going as far as saying that #NeverTrump conservatives support partial birth abortion, and her website, LifeZette, attacked conservatives like Ben Shapiro for opposing the Alt-Right. (As usual, Shapiro punched back hard .) 
Jeanine Pirro. Pirro, accompanied by Rudy Giuliani, was seen headed inside Trump Tower, which has led to speculation that she is being considered for a job in the Trump administration, according to Page Six . What that job would be is not known. 
Pirro also has been an early Trump supporter, and she has claimed to have known him for 30 years . Pirro's ex-husband, Al Pirro, has been described as ""a man Donald Trump keeps on retainer"" as a real-estate lawyer, and Trump once donated $20,000 to Pirro when she ran for New York state attorney general. 
Pirro has been with Fox News since 2006 and hosts Justice with Judge Jeanine on Saturdays. She also has an extensive legal career as a prosecutor in the state of New York and initially challenged Hillary Clinton when she ran for re-election in the Senate before dropping out to run for state attorney general.

If Trump is elected, he will have to be smarter than Putin in order to survive. Never before in American history has a presidential candidate been surrounded by so many implacable enemies baying for his blood. . . . by THE SAKER ¡°The United States is about to enter what might possibly be the deepest and most dangerous crisis of its history¡­. Maybe Trump will be the guy to bring down the Anglo-Zionist Empire in order to save the United States.¡± ¡ª The Saker 
Watching the last presidential debate was a rather depressing experience. I thought that Trump did pretty well, but that really is not the point here. The point is this: no matter who wins, an acute crisis is inevitable. Option one : Hillary wins 
Hillary would be Obama on steroids , only worse. 
Remember that Obama himself was Dubya, only worse. Of course, Dubya was just Clinton, only worse. Now the circle is closed. Back to Clinton. Except this time around, we have a woman who is deeply insecure, who failed at every single thing that she every tried to do, and who now has a three decades long record of disasters and failures. 
Even when she had no authority to start a war, she started one (told Bill to bomb the Serbs). Now she has that authority. And now she had to stand there, in front of millions of people, and hear Trump tell her ¡° Putin outsmarted you at every step of the way ¡± ¡ª did you see her frozen face when he said that? 
Trump is right. Putin did outsmart her and Obama, at every step. 
The problem is that now, after having a President with an inferiority complex towards Putin (Obama) we will have a President with the very same inferiority complex and a morbid determination to impose a no-fly zone over Russian forces in Syria. 
Looking at Hillary, with her ugly short hair and ridiculous pants, I thought to myself ¡°this is a woman who is trying hard to prove that she is every bit as tough as any man¡± ¨C except of course that she ain¡¯t. Her record also shows her as being weak, cowardly and with a sense of total impunity. And now, that evil messianic lunatic with a deep-seated inferiority complex is going to become Commander in Chief?! God help us all! Option two: Trump wins 
Problem: Trump will be completely alone. 
The Neocons have total, repeat total , control of the Congress, the media, banking and finance, and the courts. From Clinton to Clinton they have deeply infiltrated the Pentagon, Foggy Bottom, and the three letter agencies. The Fed is their stronghold. How in the world will Trump deal with these rabid ¡° crazies in the basement ¡°? 
Consider the vicious hate campaign which all these ¡°personalities¡± (from actors to politicians to reporters) have unleashed against Trump ¨C they have burned their bridges, they know that they will lose it all if Trump wins (and, if he proves to be an easy pushover his election will make no difference anyway). 
The Neocons have nothing to lose and they will fight to the very last one. What could Trump possibly do to get anything done if he is surrounded by Neocons and their agents of influence? Bring in an entirely different team? How is he going to vet them? His first choice was to take Pence as a VP ¨C a disaster (he is already sabotaging Trump on Syria and the elections outcome). I dread to hear whom Trump will appoint as a White House Chief of Staff as I am afraid that just to appease the Neocons he will appoint some new version of the infamous Rahm Emanuel¡­ And should Trump prove that he has both principles and courage, the Neocons can always ¡°Dallas¡± him and replace him with Pence. Et voil¨¤ ! 
I see only one way out: The Putin model 
When Putin came to power he inherited a Kremlin every bit as corrupt and traitor-infested as the White House nowadays. As for Russia, she was in pretty much the same sorry shape as the Independent Nazi-run Ukraine. Russia was also run by bankers and Anglo-Zionist puppets and most Russians led miserable lives. The big difference is that, unlike what is happening with Trump, the Russian version of the US Neocons never saw the danger coming from Putin. He was selected by the ruling elites as the representative of the security services to serve along a representative of the big corporate money, Medvedev. This was a compromise solution between the only two parts of the Russian society which were still functioning, the security services and oil/gas money. Putin looked like a petty bureaucrat in an ill fitting suit, a shy and somewhat awkward little guy who would present no threat to the powerful oligarchs of the semibankirshchina (the Seven Bankers) running Russia. 
Except that he turned out to be one of the most formidable rulers in Russia history. 
Here is what Putin did as soon as he came to power: 
First, he re-established the credibility of the Kremlin with the armed forces and security services by rapidly and effectively crushing the Wahabi insurgency in Chechnia. This established his personal credibility with the people he would have to rely on to deal with the oligarchs. 
Second, he used the fact that everybody, every single businessman and corporation in Russia, did more or less break the law during the 1990s, if only because there really was no law. Instead of cracking down on the likes of Berezovski or Khodorkovski for their political activities, he crushed them with (absolutely true) charges of corruption. Crucially, he did that very publicly, sending a clear message to the other arch-enemy: the media. 
Third, contrary to the hallucinations of the western human rights agencies and Russian liberals, Putin never directly suppressed any dissent, or cracked down on the media or, even less so, ordered the murder of anybody. He did something much smarter. Remember that modern journalists are first and foremost presstitutes, right? By mercilessly cracking down on the oligarchs Putin deprived the presstitutes of their source of income and political support. Some emigrated to the Ukraine, others simply resigned, and a few were left like on a reservation or a zoo on a few very clearly identifiable media outlets such as Dozhd TV , Ekho Moskvy Radio or the newspaper Kommersant . Those who emigrated became irrelevant. As for those who stayed in the ¡°liberal zoo¡±, they were harmless and they had no credibility left. Crucially, everybody else ¡°got the message¡±. After that, all it took is the appointment a few real patriots (such as Dmitri Kiselev, Margarita Simonian and others) in key positions and everybody quickly understood that the winds of fortune had now turned. 
Fourth, once the main media outlets were returned back to sanity it did not take too long for the ¡°liberal¡± (in the Russian sense, meaning pro-USA) parties to enter into a death-spiral from which they have never recovered. That, in turn, resulted in the ejection of all ¡°liberals¡± form the Duma which now has only 4 parties, all of them more or less ¡°patriotic¡±. 
Russia and the USA are very different countries, and no recipe can simply be copied from one to another. Still, there are valuable lessons from the ¡°Putin model¡± for Trump, not the least of which that his most formidable enemies probably are sitting in the Fed. One Russian analyst ¨C Rostislav Ishchenko ¨C has suggested that Trump could somehow force the Fed to increase interest rates, which would result in a bankruptcy domino effect for US banks which might be the only way to finally crush the Fed and re-take control of US banking. WHAT PUTIN ACHIEVED Of brooms and body parts 
Leon Trotsky used to say the Soviet Russia needed to be cleansed from anarchists and noblemen with an ¡°iron broom¡±. He even wrote an article in the Pravda entitled ¡°We need an iron broom¡±. Another genocidal manic, Felix Derzhinskii, founder of the notorious ChK secret police, used to say that a secret police officer must have a ¡°burning heart, a cool head and clean hands¡±. One would seek weakness, or even compassion, in vain from folks like these. These are ideology-driven ¡°true believers¡±, sociopaths with no sense of empathy, profoundly evil people with a genocidal hatred of anybody standing in their way. 
Hillary Clinton and her gang of Neocons are the spiritual (and sometimes even physical) successors of the Soviet Bolsheviks and they, just like their Bolshevik forefathers, will not hesitate for a second to crush their enemies. Donald Trump ¨C assuming he is for real and actually means what he says ¨C has to understand that and do what Putin did: strike first and strike hard. 
Stalin, by the way, also did exactly that, and for a while the Trotskists were crushed, but in the years following Stalin¡¯s death they gradually bounced back only to seize power again in 1991. 
I think that the jury is still out on whether Putin will succeed in finally removing the 5th columnists from power. 
What is sure is that Russia is at least semi-free from the control of (((these people))) and that the US is their last bastion right now. Their maniacal hatred of Trump can in part be explained by the sense of danger (((these folks))) feel, being threatened for the first time in what they see as (((their homeland))). 
I don¡¯t mean that in a patriotic sense ¨C but rather like a parasite cares for ¡°his¡± host. 
And maybe (((they))) have some good reason to fear. I sure hope that they do. 
(Brackets inserted by LD) 
I am rather encouraged by the way Trump handled the latest attempt to make him cower in fear. Yesterday Trump dared to declare that since the election might be rigged or stolen he does not pledge to recognize their outcome. And even though every semi-literate person knows that elections in the USA have been rigged and stolen in the past, including Presidential ones, by saying that Trump committed a major case of crimethink . The Ziomedia pounced on him with self-righteous outrage and put immense pressure on him to retract his statement. Instead of rolling over and recanting his ¡°crime¡±, Trump refused to do so. 
Beautiful no? Let¡¯s hope he continues to show the same courage. 
Trump is now doing what Jean-Marie Le Pen did in France: he is showing the Neocons that he dares to openly defy them, that he refuses to play by their rules, that their outrage has no effect on him and that they don¡¯t get to censor or silence him. 
That is also what he did when, yet again, he refused to accuse the Russians of cyber-attacks and, instead, repeated that it would be a good thing for Russia and the USA to be friends. 
Again, I am not sure that how long he will be able to hold that line, but for the time being there is no denying that he is openly defying the AngloZionist deep state and Empire. Conclusion The United States is about to enter what might possibly be the deepest and most dangerous crisis of its history . 
If Trump is elected, he will have to immediately launch a well-planned attack against his opponents without giving them any pretext to accuse him of politically motivated repressions. 
In Russia, Putin could count on the support of the military and the security services. I don¡¯t know whom Trump can count on, but I am fairly confident that there are still true patriots in the US armed forces. 
If Trump gets the right person to head the FBI, he might also use that agency to clean house and deliver a steady streams of indictments for corruption, conspiracy to [fill the blank], abuse of authority, obstruction of justice and dereliction of duty, etc. Since such crimes are widespread in the current circles of power, they are also easy to prove and cracking down on corruption would get Trump a standing ovation from the American people. 
Next, just as Putin in Russia, Trump will have to deal with the media. How exactly, I don¡¯t know. But he will have to face this beast and defeat it. At every step in this process he will have to get the proactive support of the people, just like Putin does. 
Can he do it? I don¡¯t know. Honestly, I doubt it. 
First, I still don¡¯t trust him. But, more relevantly, I would argue that to overthrow the deep state and restore true people power is even harder in the USA than it was in Russia. 
I have always believed that the Anglo-Zionist Empire will have to be brought down from the outside, most probably by a combination of military and economic defeats. I still believe that. However, I might be wrong ¨C in fact, I hope that I am ¨C and maybe Trump will be the guy to bring down the Anglo-Zionist Empire in order to save the United States. 
If there is such a possibility, however slim, I think that we have to believe in it and act on it as all the alternatives are far worse. Source Like this?

Firstly, it offers a neat summation of what will happen if Hillary Clinton wins: things will get worse than they have ever been before and then spiral out of control, with World War Three almost certain, given the mental instability and sheer malignancy of this female monster from hell. 
Secondly, if Trump wins, the article spells out in detail the formidable challenges that would face him ¡ª far greater in magnitude and number than the challenges facing Putin when he came to power in Russia in 1991.

Alas, even his most ardent admirers cannot possibly believe that Trump is half the man that Putin is. Indeed, the Saker ends his laudatory article of Trump with the surprising words, ¡°I still don¡¯t trust him.¡± This is because Trump is largely an unknown factor. He is the devil we don¡¯t know.

Hillary¡¯s campaign has deployed Miley Cyrus to canvas for her ¡ª when Cyrus is not busy inviting men in the audience to reach up and grab her p*ssy. (Here¡¯s a video of delicate flower Miley Cyrus in action.) 
When Vernon Jordan was asked by CBS¡¯ Mike Wallace what he talked about while golfing with Bill Clinton ¡ª aka Hillary¡¯s husband ¡ª he answered: ¡°P*ssy.¡± 
Oh, and 11 years before Teddy Kennedy ran for president as the Conscience of the Democratic Party ¡ª he killed a girl. After grabbing her p*ssy. 
(2) Trump¡¯s a sexual predator! 
Hillary¡¯s husband is a well-established rapist, groper and pants-dropper. She¡¯s his fixer. 
Unlike the serial predations of her husband, leveled repeatedly throughout the decades, the timing of these 11th-hour allegations against Trump make them highly suspect. 
Recall that The New York Times spent months investigating Trump¡¯s treatment of women earlier this year. The Newspaper of Record put its best reporters on the job, interviewed a dozen women, and the paper splashed the story on its front page. But the best the Timescould come up with was a story about Trump, as a bachelor, publicly praising a model for looking great in a bikini at his pool party. Then they dated. The horror. 
Five months later, just days before the election, there doesn¡¯t seem to be a female Democrat who isn¡¯t claiming to have been groped by Trump ¡ª and getting loads of fawning publicity. 
(3) Trump doesn¡¯t give enough to charity. 
The media only counts ¡°charitable giving¡± if it can be taken as a tax deduction with the IRS. When Trump spent time and money saving a Georgia family farm from foreclosure in the 1980s, for example, he didn¡¯t get any tax write-off. 
Hillary, by contrast, was a big philanthropist because, at about the same time, she was taking a deduction for donations of Bill¡¯s used underwear ¡ª the modern equivalent of smallpox-laden blankets. Today, the munificent Clinton Foundation spends less than 10 percent of its revenues on actual charity, using about 90 percent for salaries, offices and travel. 
(4) Several of Trump¡¯s businesses went bankrupt. 
Trump has created or helped create hundreds of businesses. Fewer than 10 went bankrupt. Hillary had one business, Whitewater Development Corp., and it went bankrupt ¡ª after ripping off scores of ordinary Americans. Also, a dozen prominent Arkansans went to prison in connection with sleazy financial transactions involving Whitewater. 
(5) Trump University was a scam! 
Approximately 10,000 graduates of Trump University were thrilled with the program and said so in writing. But a law firm that paid Hillary and Bill Clinton $675,000 for three speeches managed to find a handful of disgruntled students to be the named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against it. 
Trump University was a minuscule portion of Trump¡¯s portfolio. Whitewater was a huge part of Bill and Hillary¡¯s get-rich-quick schemes, scamming the elderly, retirees and working-class Americans for the money-hungry Clintons. 
As described by The Washington Post, people who bought property from the Whitewater Development Corp. were required to submit a down payment, followed by monthly payments, until the entire purchase price of the property was paid off. But if buyers missed a single payment for any reason, the entire transaction would be deemed null and void, and the property, as well as all prior payments, would be forfeited to the Whitewater corporation. No foreclosure proceeding, no court hearing, no due process. 
More than half of Whitewater¡¯s customers lost their entire investment. (See ¡°Whitewater Repossessions; Sales Practice Benefited Clintons, Partners,¡± The Washington Post, April 21, 1994.) 
Though Hillary had long claimed to have nothing to do with the operation of the business, when the books were finally opened, it turned out that the monthly checks were mailed to the Whitewater Development Corp. ¡ª ¡°care of Hillary Rodham Clinton.¡± (See ¡°Records Show Wider Role for Hillary Clinton; Whitewater Papers Detail Involvement,¡± The Washington Post, April 21, 1994.) 
(6) We can¡¯t allow Trump access to nuclear codes! 
Hillary is the one who is champing at the bit to go to war with Russia, which, I am reliably informed, is a nuclear power. 
At least Hillary¡¯s adept at dealing with sensitive digital information. Huma! Quick! Are the nuclear launch codes on my Blackberry, my desktop thingy or my Facebook page? 
Compared to Hillary, we¡¯d be safer if the nuclear codes were held by Miley Cyrus (unless she kept them in her p*ssy). 
(7) Trump¡¯s temperament will get us into World War III. 
Hillary¡¯s temperament drove her to push for intervention in the Libyan civil war against Moammar Gadhafi for the sole purpose of giving her a foreign policy success that could be all her own. 
Obama was skeptical. Libya was Hillary¡¯s baby. (Sidney Blumenthal¡¯s email to Hillary: ¡°First, brava! This is a historic moment and you will be credited for realizing it.¡±) 
After Gadhafi was killed, Hillary¡¯s temperament led her to go on TV and laughingly say, ¡°We came. We saw. He died.¡± 
Unfortunately, Hillary hadn¡¯t given the slightest thought to what would come next. What came next was: the Muslim Brotherhood, the murder of Americans in Benghazi and millions of refugees pouring into Western Europe. 
(8) Trump failed to denounce David Duke with the ferocity deemed sufficient by our media. 
No one even knows if Duke actually exists or is just a phantom produced by the media every four years to smear Republicans. 
I know that no one has ever been incited to commit murder after listening to a David Duke speech. Lots of people have been murdered by someone who¡¯d just heard an Al Sharpton speech: seven at Freddy¡¯s Fashion Mart in Harlem, and one Orthodox Jew, plus one Italian mistaken for a Jew, in Crown Heights. 
Hillary has not disavowed Sharpton ¡ª nor would our media be so rude as to ask. 
The mother of Ferguson thug Mike Brown, Lesley McSpadden, campaigns with Hillary ¡ª she even took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. The father of Omar Mateen, the Orlando nightclub shooter, appeared on stage behind Hillary at a rally. 
If the media won¡¯t ask her to ¡°disavow¡± the relatives of criminals and terrorists featured at her events, could they at least ask her if she approves of their parenting techniques? 
(9) Trump is a ¡°racist¡± because of his plan to remove Muslim jihadists, Mexican drug dealers and rapists from our country. 
Apart from the fact that ¡°drug dealer,¡± ¡°rapist¡± and ¡°jihadist¡± are not races, we didn¡¯t do anything to Muslims or Mexicans, except send them billions of dollars in foreign aid. The only ¡°racism¡± Americans care about is that toward black Americans. We did something to them. 
Hillary asks blacks to vote for her, then vows to bring in millions of Muslims and Mexicans to take their jobs ¡ª the ones that ¡°Americans just won¡¯t do.¡± That¡¯s racism. 
(10) Trump ¡°fat-shamed¡± Miss Universe! 
No, he didn¡¯t ¡ª he saved her crown and she was grateful. It¡¯s on tape. 
But more importantly, the Miss Universe in question is Alicia Machado, well-known in Venezuela as a publicity-seeking clown. 
Machado is credibly accused of: driving the getaway car in an attempted murder; threatening to kill a federal judge; and being the baby mama to drug cartel kingpin Gerardo Alvarez-Vazquez, who was on the State Department¡¯s ¡°Most Wanted¡± list under ¡ª let¡¯s see, checking my notes ¡ª Hillary Clinton. 
Until 1975, everyone would have realized that it¡¯s stupid to bring in single mothers with no marketable job skills, to add to the dependent class. If we did bring them in, politicians wouldn¡¯t proudly introduce them at rallies. 
But Machado is Hillary¡¯s model immigrant. Her only job skill is voting. Upside: Hillary gets another vote. Downside: You¡¯ll be supporting Machado and her anchor baby for the rest of their lives, America. 
(11) Trump is challenging the very foundation of our democracy by saying elections are rigged! 
They are rigged ¡ª ask former Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota, whose 2008 election was provably stolen from him when more than a thousand ineligible felons voted for Al Franken in a race Coleman lost by 312 votes. (At least it wasn¡¯t an important election: Franken provided the 60th, and deciding, vote to pass Obamacare.) 
In any event, Hillary says the election is rigged, too ¡ª by the Russkies! 
The Democrats and the media have gone full John Birch Society on us. There¡¯s a fifth column in America ¡ª and their leader is Donald Trump!!! 
This is a marked departure from their previous cosmopolitan sangfroid about communism. We could have really used this fighting spirit during the Cold War. Instead, we got Jimmy Carter warning Americans about their ¡°inordinate fear of communism.¡± 
Today, bad-ass, eye-rolling journalists are somberly announcing: ¡°I have in my hand a list ¡ª a list of Donald Trump supporters, who are a conscious, articulate instrument of the Russian conspiracy ¡­¡± 
(12) Trump is shallow, has a microscopic attention span and has not studied political issues deeply. 
On the other hand, he has a good heart, good judgment and wants the right outcome for America: limits on immigration, fair trade deals, the elimination of Wall Street tax breaks and no more pointless Middle East wars. 
Hillary doesn¡¯t want any of these things. She is good at memorizing all her little facts, but is deeply evil. She wakes up early in the morning to make sure she does the wrong thing for America. 
(13) Trump has personal baggage. 
This election is not about Trump. It¡¯s never been about Trump. Anyone running on his platform of putting Americans first would be torn to shreds. 
There are probably lots of bad things Trump¡¯s done in his personal life in the past. The ruling class wants Hillary to do bad things to our country in the future.",english,2016-11-03T12:37:29.057+02:00,darkmoon.me,ME,,"For every argument the media make against Trump, Hillary¡¯s worse",0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

An Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that correctly predicted the last three US elections says Donald Trump will win 
¡°If Trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years since internet engagement began in full earnest.¡± ¡ª Sanjav Rai, Indian inventor of the MogIA artificial intelligence system in 2004 
According to a report in the International Business Times (IBT) , the artificial intelligence (AI) system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the last three U.S. presidential elections has put Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. 
The AI system called MogIA was created in 2004 by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian IT company Genic.ai. 
The system works by processing 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, the IBT explained. 
It then analyzes the information to generate predictions, taking into account data such as engagement with tweets and viewership of Facebook Live videos. 
¡°If Trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years,¡± developer Rai was quoted as saying. 
Having already correctly predicted the winners of the Democratic and Republican primaries, the system found that people are 25 percent more engaged with Trump than they were with Barack Obama at his peak in 2008¡ªthe year he was elected president. 
¡°While most algorithms suffer from programmers/developer¡¯s biases, MogIA aims at learning from her environment, developing her own rules at the policy layer and develop expert systems without discarding any data,¡± Rai said. 
In September this year, Professor Allan Lichtman from Washington D.C.¡¯s American University , told the Washington Post that Trump is most likely to win based on a system of true/false statement that he calls ¡°Keys to the White House.¡± 
Professor Lichtman, who, the newspaper added, had correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election since 1984, said he based his predictions on ¡°13 true/false questions, where an answer of ¡®true¡¯ always favors the reelection of the party holding the White House.¡± 
¡°If six or more of the 13 keys are false ¡ª that is, they go against the party in power ¡ª they lose. If fewer than six are false, the party in power gets four more years,¡± he said. 
These ¡°keys¡± include questions about who holds the most seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, the lack of a significant third party campaign, the economy, the extent of a real policy change should a challenger win, the level of social unrest, foreign, and military policies. 
¡°The keys have nothing to do with presidential approval polls or horse-race polls,¡± Professor Lichtman said, going on to make it evident that he personally dislikes Trump a great deal. However, on his system the Democratic party has definitely ¡°lost¡± five of the ¡°keys,¡± and is well on course to lose a sixth, which, he said, would give the election to Trump by default. 
The New Observer has long predicted that Trump can only win if at least 70 percent of whites turn out to vote, and that he takes at least two-thirds of the white vote. Anything less than that will see a liberal minority white vote team up with the block nonwhite vote to grant Clinton victory¡ªwhich was exactly how Obama was twice elected. 
Trump¡¯s only hope therefore, lies in previous non-voters turning out, a fact to which he alluded in a recent speech, where he mentioned that reports coming in from the early voting figures revealed a massive surge in people who had never voted before.",english,2016-11-05T12:43:41.887+02:00,darkmoon.me,ME,,Artificial intelligence ¡®robot¡¯ says Trump will win,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Half of America will be shocked by jubilant rapture, the other half by black despair. I¡¯ve never know any other election like this.¡± 
Like so any others who have ended up with egg on their faces, the same commentator had confidently predicted a victory for Hillary Clinton. These false prophets, among whom we can number the author of this present article, Dominic Sandbrook, were convinced that Hillary Clinton would soon be installed in the White House. Here is what our esteemed commentator told us yesterday. How hollow and even ridiculous his words sound today! I quote them only because they are so typical. 
Listen buddies, you are my online friends and I hope you¡¯re all gonna be made very happy tomorrow morning as Trump becomes the new Augustus of Pax Americana . But I have this sinking feeling in my gut that it ain¡¯t gonna happen. Hillary is gonna win because all the cards are stacked in her favor. 
Remember this, even if 70% of Americans vote for Trump, those Diebold voting machines are gonna turn real nasty and start spitting out fire and devil smoke. 
And it¡¯s gonna be Crazy Hillary and rapist Hubby Bill waltzing into the White House and up the gallery stairs into the hot tub on the top floor, with assorted nymphettes simpering among the bubbles and going ¡°Oooh! . . . Ahhh! . . . take it easy sir, I¡¯m only a Girl Scout!¡± 
Ya can¡¯t make this up. ?? 
Silly words? Obviously. If I¡¯d said them myself, I¡¯d now be blushing with shame for making such a fool of myself. 
The fact is, we have all made fools of ourselves, not least the Republican Party that took the unprecedented step of disowning their own candidate, Donald Trump, and giving their support to his Democratic competitor Hillary Clinton. Here was a man, they alleged shamefully, who was was in the pocket of Vladimir Putin and took orders from the Kremlin. He was closer to the Kremlin than he was to Nato. If America elected this man, they spluttered, the trump of doom ¡ªno pun intended¡ªwould soon be reverberating from Washington to Vladivostok. 
The man they spat upon and denigrated so treacherously is now their boss. Let¡¯s hope he punishes them. Let¡¯s hope he puts Hillary behind bars, as he promised . 
If he now does a U-turn and cuddles up to the Establishment, and if his first trip abroad is to Tel Aviv, his millions of supporters will know they have been cruelly betrayed. Just as Tony Blair betrayed Britain, turning into one of the greatest liars and war criminals in British history, it remains to be seen if Trump is not going to do a similar U-turn by cuddling up to the enemies of America: to the Rothschilds and Soroses and Adelsons and the neoconservative warmongers who put Israel before America and pay regular visits to the Wailing Wall. 
And so we come now to this ¡°prophetic¡± article by Dominic Sandbrook, political sage of the Daily Mail . I wish it were satire. It is not. It is written, three days before the election on November 5, with a straight face. Fasten your seat belts, dear readers, and get ready for a good laugh. Here is the mainstream media at its most fatuous and farcical, spewing forth imbecilities for the semi-moronic masses. Oh, how sad! and how deeply sobering. [LD] WHAT IF TRUMP DID WIN? by Dominic Sandbrook 
The 45th President of the United States reached his 1,000th day in office yesterday, and he marked it in characteristic style. 
Rising shortly before lunch, the most powerful man in the world took a congratulatory phone call from his closest ally, Russia¡¯s Vladimir Putin, before strolling into the White House Rose Garden, where a group of swimwear models were waiting with an enormous white and gold cake. 
¡®Thank you, Mr President,¡¯ they chorused, ¡®for making America great again!¡¯ 
If the impromptu party was overshadowed by the chanting of thousands of protesters outside the perimeter, the President showed no sign of being particularly worried. 
¡®Take care of them,¡¯ he told the head of his Russian bodyguard, who had replaced the Secret Service a few months ago. Then he nodded meaningfully at the models: ¡®I¡¯ll see you girls later . . .¡¯ 
According to his spokesman, the President spent the afternoon closeted with his advisers in a private suite at his wife Melania¡¯s $1,000-an-hour spa (formerly the White House¡¯s East Wing), discussing the opening of his Senate impeachment trial in a few days¡¯ time. Then he retired for the evening with some of his closest confidants, among them the actor Charlie Sheen, the former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and the ex-wrestler Hulk Hogan. 
To look at the President¡¯s beaming, orange-skinned face, you would hardly know that Washington is in meltdown, that he faces multiple congressional investigations into his finances and that, every day, rival mobs of demonstrators do battle only steps from the White House. 
Nor would you know that the American economy is in deep recession, its cities are ablaze after months of race riots, an undeclared war is raging on the Mexican border and a nuclear conflict now seems inevitable in the Pacific. 
Never has the gap between image and reality been greater. Never has the world¡¯s greatest republic plunged to such depths. 
But then what did you expect from President Donald Trump? 
The trouble started within moments of Mr Trump¡¯s unexpected comeback victory in the election of Tuesday, November 8, 2016, when riots broke out in several cities, including Chicago, Boston, Miami and Los Angeles. 
Thousands of buildings were burned, but the new president-elect nevertheless maintained that it had been the ¡®greatest night¡¯ in American history: ¡®The greatest. Period.¡¯ 
In his victory speech he broke with the traditional courtesies by openly pouring scorn on his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton (¡®a major-league loser¡¯), and promising his supporters that ¡®Crooked Hillary¡¯ would shortly be facing a ¡®long stretch in jail¡¯. LD : Wrong! See the 20-minute video below in which Trump, doing his first apparent U-turn, lavishes words of praise on Hillary and tells Americans how grateful they should be to her for all her hard work and dedication. So what happened to all that talk of putting her behind bars? 
In fact, Mrs Clinton remains very much at large. 
Even though President Trump insisted that her criminal conviction would be one of his chief priorities, and immediately appointed a special prosecutor with a brief to investigate her activities dating back to the Seventies, the FBI are reportedly still trawling through thousands of emails, having unearthed yet another tranche last month. 
There were more signs of the new era, meanwhile, at his inauguration ceremony in January 2017, when Mr Trump appeared on the stage waving his ¡®Make America Great Again¡¯ baseball cap, in front of a mock-classical fa?ade in which his own surname was spelled out in gigantic, diamond-studded letters. 
Unusually, the 45th President broke with precedent by refusing to deliver a prepared speech, preferring to ¡®speak from the heart¡¯, as he put it. 
Returning to some familiar themes, he told his audience that his predecessor, Barack Obama, was a ¡®terrorist¡¯ and a ¡®Muslim¡¯, that most Mexicans were ¡®rapists¡¯ and ¡®murderers¡¯, that China was ¡®in for a shock¡¯ and that Nato was ¡®a complete waste of time and money¡¯. 
Most foreign leaders were appalled. But one man who clearly approved was Vladimir Putin, who had been the first head of state to telephone his congratulations to the new president-elect. 
After only two weeks in office, Mr Trump rewarded his new friend by making his first overseas trip to Moscow, where he assured the press that Mr Putin ¡®couldn¡¯t have been nicer¡¯ and promised that under his administration, the Russians would be ¡®our number one ally. Number One. I mean that¡¯. LD : It remains to be seen whether Trump¡¯s first trip abroad is to Moscow or Tel Aviv. That would be the litmus test. 
His European tour later in 2017, however, was a disaster. 
After Mr Trump was recorded making remarks about Germany¡¯s Angela Merkel that cannot be repeated in a family newspaper, he moved on to London, where he told Theresa May that she had a ¡®massive Muslim problem¡¯ and urged her to redevelop Chequers as a high-end golf course. 
Today, the American republic¡¯s reputation in the world has never been lower. Even at the United Nations it has become a laughing stock, especially after Mr Trump¡¯s UN ambassador, Sarah Palin, gave a speech in which she confused Iraq and Iran, suggested Africa was a single country and joked about dropping a nuclear bomb on Saudi Arabia. 
On the U.S.-Mexican border, however, things have gone well beyond a joke. 
Work on what Mr Trump calls his ¡®Great Wall¡¯ began within days of his inauguration, though it is unlikely to be finished before he leaves office and will reportedly cost at least $25 billion. 
After a series of sabotage attacks by Mexican protesters in mid-2018, Mr Trump abruptly lost patience and ordered the U.S. Marines to cross the border and occupy a strip some ten miles deep ¡ª which prompted the Mexican government to move its own troops to within a mile or two of the U.S. incursion. 
As yet, the two sides have merely skirmished, though the death toll currently stands at almost 400 ¡ª a figure that would have been unthinkable three years ago. 
It would take only one incident, one clash that gets completely out of hand, to trigger a full-scale war. 
At home, meanwhile, Mr Trump¡¯s authoritarian measures, such as his shambolic and callous attempt to deport 11 million undocumented migrants, have provoked outrage. 
The summer of 2018 was marked by weeks of rioting in many major cities, while the President¡¯s insistence on declaring the Left-wing activist group Black Lives Matter a ¡®terrorist organisation¡¯ sparked huge protests on campuses across the nation. 
It was at this point that Congress, already enraged by Mr Trump¡¯s reliance on high-handed and arguably unconstitutional executive orders, began discussing impeachment proceedings against the President. 
But of course, this only enraged his loyal supporters, who maintain that he is the innocent victim of a conspiracy masterminded by Barack Obama, the Clintons and the American media. 
Mr Trump himself remains remarkably unruffled by the prospect of impeachment, though some experts claim his famously unearthly hair is a lot thinner than it used to be. 
He maintains his Congressional critics are ¡®crooks¡¯ and ¡®liars¡¯, and has made extraordinarily insulting remarks about the potency and masculinity of both the Democratic leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, and the Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. 
Recently, Mr Trump¡¯s attacks on Congress have reached new heights. He now appears to believe that many leading politicians, both Democratic and Republican, have secretly converted to Islam. 
¡®How do we know that the Bushes aren¡¯t Muslims?¡¯ he demanded last week. ¡®Why else were they so keen on going to Iraq?¡¯ 
Genuine Muslims, however, have no place in Mr Trump¡¯s America. He made that very clear within hours of taking the oath of office, when he signed an emergency executive order banning any Muslims from entering the United States. 
Since he became President 1,000 days ago, attacks on Muslim Americans, including men and women who have worn their nation¡¯s uniform, have reportedly increased tenfold. 
There have been arson attacks on mosques in Boston, New York, Chicago and Detroit, all of which Mr Trump refused point-blank to visit afterwards. 
All of this has naturally put him at odds with America¡¯s traditional Nato allies. But Mr Trump¡¯s disregard for Nato was well-known even before he took office. 
Most European leaders can barely bring themselves to look at him. 
Theresa May has reportedly not even said a word to him for more than a year. But as Mr Trump is fond of reminding people, ¡®small-time¡¯ countries such as Britain and Germany are ¡®finished¡¯. ¡®My friend Vladimir,¡¯ he says smugly, ¡®is the strongest man in the world. Apart from myself, obviously.¡¯ 
As it happens, the Russian President is scheduled to fly into Washington next week to express his solidarity at the beginning of his friend¡¯s formal trial in the Senate. As usual, Putin is likely to arrive with a large military entourage, many of whom are expected to stay on in the U.S. capital as additional ¡®security¡¯ for his beleaguered ally. 
As Mr Trump remarked last week, he has already arranged a suitable welcoming committee of young American female interns for his Russian counterpart. 
¡®All gorgeous,¡¯ he said proudly. ¡®I just start kissing them . . . and when you¡¯re a president, they let you do it, you can do anything.¡¯ ¡°I can¡¯t stop kissing them. When you¡¯re a president, you can do anything !¡± 
Those last words have been something of a motto for Mr Trump. Since his election as President, he has indeed done anything he wants. 
The result, however, has not merely tarnished forever the image of the Presidency, driven the American economy into recession and destroyed relations between religions and races. It has shattered the Western alliance, allowed Vladimir Putin to rebuild the Soviet empire and left the United States on the brink of nuclear war with the world¡¯s most populous country. 
Yet even as American cities burn and Congress attempts to drive him from office, Mr Trump remains undaunted. HISTORIC ¡ª TRUMP¡¯S VICTORY SPEECH VIDEO : 20 mins",english,2016-11-09T17:04:39.269+02:00,darkmoon.me,ME,,AMERICA STUNNED! ¡ª Mein Trumpf Storms into the White House,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

This is an amazing victory. The stars were aligned. First, the very long shot of Trump being nominated. Then he gets to run against the most corrupt, least charismatic candidate in history (I think Joe Biden would have beaten Trump, and maybe even Bernie Sanders) at a time when Americans naturally want change after 8 years of Obama. 
Fundamentally, it is a victory of White Americans over the oligarchic, hostile elites what have run this country for decades. Trump accomplished a hostile takeover of the Republican Party and won without the support or with only lukewarm and vacillating support from much of the GOP elite. 
In May of 2015 I was very despondent about our prospects. It just didn¡¯t seem like we could break through the elite consensus dominating all the high ground¡ªand all the moral high ground¡ªof the U.S., including the media (print, television, and the Hollywood movie industry), the academic world, politics, Wall St., and the CEOs of major corporations. We were systematically shut out and it was obvious that the powers that be were not going to let the Alt Right get a seat at the table. Then Trump announced, it was hard to take it seriously, but his comments on immigration, American nationalism, political correctness and trade certainly struck a chord. My immediate reaction (July 10, 2015), however, was that he had two things going for him that were absolutely unique ¡ª he is a celebrity and he is very, very rich (¡° How it could happen ¡°). Such a person is in a position to be heard; he can¡¯t be shut out of the media, and he doesn¡¯t need the money of the corrupt donor class. In fact, the media, eager for ratings, gave him countless opportunities to get his message out. Anyone on the Alt Right could have said the exact same things, but we would be speaking into our closets. 
Even back in July of 2015, it was obvious Trump was not your usual GOP candidate: 
[Trump] certainly did not fall in my estimation when he attacked two prominent operatives of the Republican Party/Israel Lobby nexus hostile to his candidacy, Charles Krauthammer and Jonah Goldberg. Then there¡¯s the Twitter incident : ¡°I promise you that I¡¯m much smarter than Jonathan Leibowitz ¡ª I mean Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow,¡± tweeted Trump , adding, ¡°Who, by the way, is totally overrated.¡± It is, of course, considered ¡°anti-Semitic¡± to ever call attention to the fact that someone is Jewish because of the absolutely outrageous suggestion that the Jewish identity of someone like Stewart/Leibowitz might influence his opinions. As we all know, Jews are just like everybody else. 
And it quickly turned out that he understood the anger in White America far better than anyone else and he was willing to say what they wanted to hear ¡ª most of all the White working class (72-23!), but also White women(53-43), and his deficit among White educated women was only 51-45 ( CBS exit polls ). Looks like quite a few college-educated women ignored what they heard in their gender studies courses and those mandatory credits in Black Studies. 
While obviously a lot of work needs to be done, this is a glorious day. 
The following is an expanded version of my article in Radix Journal¡¯s series on the meaning of Trump. 
The Alt Right has gravitated to Trump¡¯s candidacy, and for good reason. Much of what the Alt Right wants will be difficult or impossible to bring about even with a president who is entirely on board with the idea that America should start thinking about the interests of its traditional White majority. But win or lose, Trump has already had a huge effect on American politics in a way that benefits the Alt Right, and his victory will be even more so: Trump has made statements on immigration that have been banned from polite society for 50 years ¡ª deport illegals, seal the border, end birthright citizenship, place a moratorium on Muslim immigration, and make immigration serve actual labor needs rather than a moral imperative (ideally with guest workers not given citizenship). He has deplored Angela Merkel¡¯s policies in Germany and has made statements indicating he opposes the transformation of Western societies via immigration and multiculturalism (¡° Paris isn¡¯t Paris anymore .¡±) Trump¡¯s victory will encourage and energize the right in Europe. It is Brexit on steroids ¡ª a scream by voters to stop the way things are going. To stop the destruction of their traditional ways of life. If nothing else, it is throwing a monkey wrench into the system. Tear it down! We can¡¯t keep going on like this! Voters want an end to meaningless wars, an end to importing people who hate us and will never assimilate to our way of life. Trump has unmasked the neocons. The neocons have dominated the intellectual and foreign policy establishment of the Republican Party since the 1980s. From the beginning of Trump¡¯s candidacy, neocons have been leading the #NeverTrump movement, despite the catastrophic effects of a Hillary Clinton presidency on the GOP. A Clinton presidency would ensure a liberal/left voting majority into the foreseeable future given that she would amnesty millions of illegals and dramatically raise total numbers of immigrants and refugees. Clinton Supreme Court appointments would likely gut the First Amendment by enabling ¡°hate speech¡± laws and they would gut the Second Amendment as well. No one on the right, from traditional ¡°limited government¡± conservatives to the Alt Right, would want this, and it¡¯s difficult to believe that the Jewish identities and pro-Israel commitments of the most important neocons are lost on non-Jewish Republicans. The treason of the neocons will be long remembered in GOP circles and will compromise their influence in the future. 
I notice on Twitter that Bill Kristol says that the #NeverTrumpers should be magnanimous in losing, but I would be shocked if neocons were given any role in the GOP. This is Trump¡¯s party now. It is incredibly heartening that he wants a good relationship with Russia at a time when neocons and NATO have been clamoring for confrontation and aggression. It is incredibly heartening that he supports the legitimate Assad government in Syria. I have no doubt that he will act in concert with Russia to end the rebellion and bring peace and stability to the region. Trump has highlighted the chasm between the overwhelmingly White Republican voting base and the GOP donor class intent on globalist policies of mass immigration, free trade, and a bellicose pro-Israel, anti-Russian foreign policy. The pre-Trump GOP was dominated by a neocon foreign policy establishment and a pro-Chamber of Commerce, pro-big business economic policy. This party did not represent the interests of GOP voters and can¡¯t be resurrected. Even if Trump had lost, his energized supporters would be a new and important force within the GOP. His victory will ensure that the GOP will be a populist party for the foreseeable future. Trump has unmasked the media. The media have always been liberal, but this time around, even much of the usual pro-Republican media has been hostile to Trump, and a survey by the Media Research Center found an astounding 91% of media coverage hostile to his candidacy. Who can forget the hostility from mainstream conservative media like National Review , The Weekly Standard , and other neocon outlets? This feeds into the narrative that there has been a unified establishment from the far left to the neoconservative right that has opposed Trump¡¯s populist policies favoring the middle class and the traditional White majority. 
The media is a pillar of the establishment, and it is heartening indeed that people ignored the deluge of talk of Trump being a racist, a bigot, and a misogynist. The media is a huge loser in Trump¡¯s victory. 
As we have commented many times, the media is under very powerful Jewish influence. Trump¡¯s victory is a blow to the entire Jewish power structure. I have written 6 articles on Jewish hostility toward Trump, much of this hostility bordering on the clinically paranoid. Jews understand that they do indeed have a great deal of power in the U.S. and throughout the West and that they have used that power to destroy the traditional homogeneity of these societies and to do all they can to make Whites minorities in societies they have dominated for hundreds and, in the case of Europe, many thousands of years. We are a long way from really putting a dent in that power structure, but Trump¡¯s victory is a great first step. Trump has put the Alt Right on the map. There have been numerous articles and commentary on the Alt Right because of Trump¡¯s candidacy. The Alt Right has been the only identifiable intellectual perspective supporting Trump, although we understand that he is not one of us and would not attempt to do much what we would like to see in our ideal world. We are the only intellectual perspective that takes race seriously and accepts the social science research not only on race but on the disastrous costs of imposed multiculturalism for White majorities and the horrifying future awaiting Whites if indeed they do become hated, despised minorities. Traditional conservative intellectuals simply cannot explain what is happening with their usual intellectual toolkit. They can¡¯t explain the anger and the very legitimate fears of the White majority. They can¡¯t understand the racialization of politics. We understand it and are able to analyze it in very sophisticated ways that are entirely within the scientific mainstream. 
Much of the media coverage of the Alt Right was motivated by attempting to tar Trump as a ¡°racist,¡± and after the election, win or lose, the media will likely attempt to put the toothpaste back in the tube by ceasing coverage. However, a Trump victory makes that all but impossible. Our increased visibility has meant a very large surge in support for the Alt Right. Meeting attendance is way up, and readership on Alt Right sites is skyrocketing. The future is bright, and a very large amount of the credit for that has to go to Donald Trump.

Is the s**t is about to hit the fan? Is the fur about to start flying? Maybe! It¡¯s too early to tell. With a new investigation promised into the true facts behind 9/11, there are already rumors surfacing . . . rumors that certain people in high places are getting a bit worried and thinking about buying one-way tickets to Tel Aviv. WHODUNIT?!? 
Donald Trump¡¯s plans for his first 100 days in office are raising eyebrows around the world, but of all the items on his agenda it is the reopening of the 9/11 investigation that will provide the greatest earthquake for the establishment. 
Trump believes that 9/11 has not been properly investigated and he plans to get to the bottom of it. ¡°First of all, the original 9/11 investigation is a total mess and has to be reopened,¡± Trump said. 
The election of Donald Trump has rocked the establishment and things are only going to get rockier for them during his first term. There is a reason George W. Bush didn¡¯t vote for Trump in the election, leaving the presidential line blank and voting Republican down-ballot. Trump has pledged to investigate 9/11 in a way it has not been investigated before. 
For the first time 9/11 will be investigated by someone who isn¡¯t part of the establishment, with skin in the game and plenty to lose. 
¡°First of all, the original 9/11 investigation is a total mess and has to be reopened¡± Trump announced to supporters. ¡°How do two planes take out three buildings in the same day? I never got my head around the fact that nothing is mentioned about the destruction of Building 7 in the 585 page document,¡± he explained, talking about World Trade Center 7 which also collapsed ¨C inexplicably ¨C during the September 11 attacks. 
Donald Trump has also taken cracks at former president George W. Bush. There will be no covering up for former presidents on Trump¡¯s watch. 
¡°The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush,¡± he said in a February debate. ¡°He kept us safe? That is not safe. That is not safe.¡± 
¡°Why did the administration at the time not take legal means against Saudi Arabia? Weren¡¯t 19 of the high-jackers from Saudi Arabia? Americans deserve answers and I will definitely request a new investigation so that this horrible tragedy never happens again.¡± Donald Trump and the 9/11 Truth movement 
While Trump might be railing against the establishment in reopening the 9/11 investigation, he has received support on this issue from a number of public personalities who have demanded the case be revisited ¨C and not behind closed doors. 
Former Senator Bob Graham has been demanding a new, transparent investigation ¡°For years I have been campaigning for the release of the 2002 Joint Congressional Intelligence Committee 9/11 Inquiry¡¯s report, to no avail¡± explains the former Governor of Florida. ¡°These missing pages point to the direct involvement of the government of Saudi Arabia. Why are these being kept secret? Who has to gain from these games of secrecy?¡± he asks. 
¡°I have read these documents myself and if the American public knew what was in these documents, there would be a revolution tomorrow in the streets of America¡± he acknowledged during a radio interview. ¡°Americans deserve to know the truth¡± he concluded, visibly angered by the whole affair. 
Since 2002, the release of a number of 9/11 Commission Report documents is hindered because they are congressional records, hence they are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 
The long withheld 28 pages were partially released to the public this year ¨C heavily redacted ¨C and the Saudi government claimed the release proved they were not responsible for supporting or financing the attacks. But it¡¯s not as simple as that. There are direct ties to the Saudi hierarchy in the 28 pages. There are a lot of questions that need answering, and they were never going to be addressed under a Clinton presidency with all her ties to Saudi Arabia. But with President Trump¡¯s executive powers, everything has changed. The establishment are on edge. More than half the country doesn¡¯t believe the official version of what happened that day. There is now a renewed belief that this biggest of lies and cover ups is about to be dismantled. 
The establishment did all it could to destroy Trump¡¯s election chances. 
Now they are on edge. Like this? Share it now. 3 thoughts on ¡° TRUMP BOMBSHELL! ¡ª I¡¯m reopening 9/11 Investigation ¡± Gilbert Huntly says:",english,2016-11-11T15:49:43.728+02:00,darkmoon.me,ME,,TRUMP BOMBSHELL! ¡ª I¡¯m reopening 9/11 Investigation,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

THE COMING STORM Economic Armageddon is on its way ! While many of us in the alternative media and especially those researchers of Clinton crimes are breathing a big fat sigh of relief that anybody but Hillary is headed to the White House in 2017, Brandon Smith of Alt Market is warning us all not to get too comfortable¡­ and with history on his side here, we should listen to him. 
Despite what looked like a rigged, fraudulent Hillary win orchestrated from the top down with the entire establishment machine behind her, Trump won the election. In an election year that would have otherwise seen record low voter turnout, the specter of Hillary that led to Trump¡¯s victory has now given the people a reason to believe their vote actually matters again, an extra boon to further relegitimize the corrupt system running things in this country. 
But Brandon Smith reminds us that if Trump is walking into the Oval Office in January, it is only because the elites decided to put him there in advance ¡ª and for a reason. 
First it should be noted that Smith accurately predicted that Brexit would pass , even when the majority of the alt media was reporting that there was no way it possibly could. Was it another victory for the people? 
No, it was predetermined well in advance: ¡°The mainstream media has been consistently comparing Trump supporters to Brexit supporters, and Trump himself has hitched his political wagon to the Brexit. This fits perfectly with the globalist narrative that populists and conservatives are killing the global economy and placing everyone at risk. ¡° 
Then he accurately predicted a Trump win ¡­ but not because voting actually matters: ¡°U.S. elections are indeed controlled, and have been for decades, primarily through the false left/right paradigm. However, as I have been pointing out since I correctly predicted the success of the Brexit referendum, I don¡¯t think that Clinton is the choice of the elites.¡± ¡°To be clear, my position is that Trump is slated to take the White House and that this is by design. This has been my position since before Trump won the Republican Primaries, it was my position when the election cycle began, it has never changed, nor have my views on the reasons for this outcome ever changed¡­¡± 
Smith says regardless of whether or not Trump is a legitimate anti-establishment candidate, his win means the global economic collapse the system has been holding off on will finally come to pass ¡ª as planned ¡ª under Trump¡¯s watch: ¡°¡­Even if Trump is a legitimate anti-establishment conservative, his entry into the Oval Office will seal the deal on the economic collapse, and will serve the globalists well. The international banks need only pull the plug on any remaining life support to the existing market system and allow it to fully implode, all while blaming Trump and his conservative supporters¡­¡± 
He will be the perfect scapegoat for something the alternative media have known is coming for a long, long time. 
Now Smith is spelling it out : The bottom line is, Trump is on the way to the White House because the elites WANT HIM THERE. Now, many liberty proponents, currently in a state of elation, will either ignore or dismiss the primary reason why I was able to predict the Brexit and a Trump win. These will probably be some of the same people that were arguing with me only weeks ago that the elites would NEVER allow Trump in office. So, to clarify: Trump may or may not be aware that he and his conservative followers have been positioned into a a trap. We will have to wait and see how he behaves in office (and he WILL be in office, despite the claims of some that the elites will try to ¡°stop him¡± before January). My primary point is THAT IT DOES NOT MATTER, at least not at this stage. The elites will initiate a final collapse of the global economy under Trump¡¯s watch (this will probably escalate over the course of the next six months), and they WILL blame him and conservatives in general. This IS going to happen. The elites play the long game, and so must we. 
And there you have it. 
It¡¯s not much of a secret that the economy is being artificially propped up. The Fed¡¯s QE stimulus programs are no longer working. We know it can¡¯t remain this way forever. 
And even though everyone just feels so much relief that we¡¯ve all been spared the nightmare of Hillary Clinton climbing into yet another seat of even more power, we can¡¯t just assume we¡¯re all going to skip off into happy magical fairy sprinkle land unscathed. 
Sure, the people have spoken, but it¡¯s only the illusion of power that we¡¯re seeing play out now. The Powers That Shouldn¡¯t Be running this insanity circus always have a plan¡­ how else have they gotten away with controlling the globe for at least the past century? 
While millions of Americans are celebrating Trump¡¯s win today, I will remain even more vigilant. The party is just getting started, folks. Don¡¯t get too comfortable. Sadly, we can¡¯t ignore decades of New World Order history here just because we¡¯re relieved a psychopath like Hillary lost the election.

ERIC CANTOR , Republican politician, and LISSA MUSCATINE, Hillary Clinton¡¯s former speech writer, were two of the many Jews given free rein to reflect on Donald Trump a few days ago before millions of BBC viewers. 
¡°In the end one could not help noticing one interesting if rather awkward fact about that edition of BBC Newsnight. The editor, two out of three of the main presenters, and all seven of the main interviewees in Washington and London were JEWISH. Not bad for a group said to represent less than 0.4% of the British population.¡± ¡ª Francis Carr Begbie 
You might think that after a disaster as humiliating as the election of Donald Trump that our anointed elites would take this opportunity for a bit of humility ¡ª that this would be an opportunity for introspection and some soul-searching self-reflection. 
Well, the good news is that you would be wrong. For this would involve a level of self-awareness far beyond our narcissistic elites. All around they are demonstrating a complete inability to understand the forces behind their humiliation at the hands of a man they dismissed as a joke from day one and whose demise they predicted every inch of the way. 
This self-deception was wonderfully on display in an immediate post-election edition of the BBC¡¯s flagship current affairs programme Newsnight , broadcast to the nation the day after and including a number of American interviewees. In a specially extended version of the show, programme editor Ian Katz dispatched Emily Maitlis , Mark Urban and David Grossman to find answers on the day after the result. 
In both London and Washington a stellar line up of the finest brains from the media and the academy were assembled to help them chew it over. 
Entertainingly, the vanity, narcissism and entitlement of the BBC presenter-ocracy was fully on view, proud and undented. To the accompaniment of the Beatles tune ¡°Fool on the Hill¡± anchor Emily Maitlis could barely contain her rage and sputtered about how ¡°a game show host and someone who owned a beauty pageant¡± could become president. 
Populism, uprising, nationalism versus globalism; as with former President Bush¡¯s puzzlement over ¡°the vision thing,¡± they seemed to be able to mouth the words but comprehension was lacking. 
With every guest, Emily Maitlis showed that old habits die hard or not at all. She dripped condescension from the outset, snapping at immigration traitor , pro-Israel fanatic former US Congressman Eric Cantor who was perhaps trying to redeem himself given the new winds in the Republican Party: ¡°We talked about the vulgarity of this man ¡­ This is a man who talked of grabbing women by the pussy. Is that a man you are proud [of]?¡± An angry school teacher furious with the behaviour of her immature, irresponsible charges. 
Easily the funniest moment in the programme came during a virtuoso splenetic performance from historian Simon Schama who seemed to think it was Germany in 1933 all over again. Race, he said, was more important factor in the election than the economic arguments. SIMON SCHAMA, ASHKENAZI JEW 
Wriggling in his seat, as if it was subjected to regular electric shocks, he said. 
¡°It is really weird to me how we pussyfoot around the toxic malodorous element of race which has played an important part of this. Anti-semitism has long been part of populism¡­ [beginning] in the early twentieth century. Even today there were sinister references by the likes of senator Jeff Sessions to George Soros who was singled out as a particularly odious figure in this international banking conspiracy.¡± 
(To which many people in the Alt Right might have replied: ¡°couldn¡¯t have put it better myself.¡±) 
Schama almost lost it completely when co-interviewee and neocon stalwart Melanie Phillips told him to calm down a bit. 
¡°It is not a moment for calm, it is not a moment for calm.¡± he screeched. MELANIE PHILLIPS, ASHKENZI JEW AND VIRULENT ZIONIST 
Melanie knows very well what these anti-semitic dog whistles are like. This too is part of populism. We are facing a cataclysmic moment. Melanie is right to say it is a populist revolt. It is nothing to do with conservative republican politics. It amuses me to hear that Eric Cantor imagines that things are going to go on as they always did in the Republican party ¡­ [that they] will restrain Donald Trump. They won¡¯t. George Washington warned about despotism and that is what we are facing. 
Melanie Phillips, for her part, agreed the most important problem was anti-Semitism, but she saw it coming from a completely different quarter. 
There are noxious elements around. ¡­ Clearly some of the people supporting Trump are anti-semitic and racists but that is also true of people on the left. There is no sign that he (Trump) personally is anti-semitic or racist. People call people racist when they want to restrict as he does, legal immigration. Anti-semitism is now at record levels at liberal universities overseen by liberal professors and liberal vice chancellors. 
Studio presenter Evan Davies muttered about how they had to give up something to people worried about the loss of their traditional societies and really act on illegal immigration. But Schama wasn¡¯t listening. He was worried about David Duke. 
Donald Trump re-tweeted a neo-Nazi tweet. It is not a coincidence that David Duke, KKK Imperial Wizard, is exhilarated and rejoicing with the advent of Trump who is his man. We will see race crimes, hate crimes explode now. We will have a far-right supreme court which will reverse Roe [v.] Wade. 
As a glimpse into the fevered imagination of at least one strongly identifying Jew, it could not have been more revealing. Before Schama actually self-detonated on air, the programme moved on to more heavyweights. 
Neoconservative think tanker Danielle Pletka , senior vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, complained she had no idea what Trump¡¯s policies were. Which was not very helpful. 
Mary Kaldor , professor of global governance at the London School of Economics, complained that Trump was ¡°wildly unpredictable¡± in his stated foreign policies. ¡°He says ¡®I love Israel,¡¯ then he says he wants to be neutral between Israel and Palestine.¡± For her the real danger seemed to be peace. Or as she framed it, Trump getting friendly with Putin to create an ¡°alliance of authoritarian right wing leaders.¡± 
But it was the Pulitzer prize-winning historian of communism Anne Applebaum who painted the most apocalyptic scenario. Applebaum, who has never seen a ¡°Deep State¡± she didn¡¯t like, said that Trump had been disdainful for NATO and cannot understand why America needs to be in Europe. His admiration for Vladimir Putin as an ideal was very worrying. ANNE APPLEBAUM . . . ANOTHER ASHKENAZI JEW 
Europeans need to start from the assumption that United States is not a reliable partner. We need to keep repeating that until it sinks into people¡¯s brains. 
She really said that. 
Applebaum said Trump sees no need for a relationship with the UK. He said that Trump, who has spent millions developing his two golf courses, which include Turnberry, is, apparently, ¡°not an anglophile and has no interest in Britain. Hillary Clinton does.¡± Surely, asked presenter Grossman, the Brexit referendum puts Britain and the USA on the same page? Applebaum: ¡°No, no, no.¡± 
Both these women think it makes the election of Marie le pen more likely. Likely correct, and thank god for that! 
Alan Greenspan , former chairman of the Fed, was wheeled on to say that he, a lifelong Republican had not voted. He also explained that Trump would not be able to get rid of the current Federal Reserve Bank chair Janet Yellen without a complicated impeachment process. 
Earlier in the show, Maitlis tried to get Republican Eric Cantor to condemn Trump but got no change. Cantor responded lamely about Trump¡¯s promise to build a border wall. ¡°I¡¯m not so sure that is going to happen¡± ¡ª showing (not surprisingly) that he remains an immigration traitor at heart. And he continues to show his allegiance to Israel. Cantor said he was less interested in Trump¡¯s immigration policies than his Middle East policies, including his intention to get rid of ISIS. 
Lissa Muscatine , Hillary¡¯s former speech writer, assured Maitlis that her old college friend had bounced back as strong as ever. 
Elsewhere David Grossman did a breakdown of the vote to show that women and Hispanics had leaned to Trump in far greater numbers that anyone thought possible. (In fact, a solid majority of White women voted for Trump, proving Schama right: Trump voters are racists.) In the end one could not help noticing one interesting if rather awkward fact about that edition of BBC Newsnight . The editor, two out of three of the main presenters, and all seven of the main interviewees in Washington and London were Jewish. Not bad for a group said to represent less than 0.4% of the British population. 
I should note, however, that there were a smattering of Vox pop style three-second sound-bite interviewees of men in baseball hats celebrating in bars and so on. There was also an abortive panel of a Hispanic man, black woman and Jewish New York Times reporter, and there was a Latvian politician down the line. But otherwise it was an extremely Kosher programme. 
The BBC operates one of the most aggressive affirmative action policies in the Western world. In keeping with its position as the Vatican of political correctness, a finger is kept on the scales of employment opportunity to ensure that jobs are skewed heavily for favoured groups. 
But given that self-awareness is one area where the elites are notably deficient, it might be s good idea to remind them of the massive Jewish overrepresentation on display here. This is one very privileged group indeed. Overrepresented and overprivileged, one might say. Like this?

They just wanted to give the ¡°liberal elites¡±¡ªor the Establishment¡ªthe middle finger. ¡®Take that, you bastards!¡¯ 
As the articles rain down from liberals explaining how Trump won his astonishing, appalling plurality, we can at least give thanks that we¡¯re spared the canard that all of his supporters are racists, xenophobes, and misogynists. Neo-Blackshirts, of course, make up a frighteningly large share (sixty percent? seventy? eighty?) of his supporters, but thanks to months of Brexit analysis and now days of exit interviews here at home, it¡¯s clear that a great many Trump voters aren¡¯t monsters. They merely voted with the monsters because they saw no other way to give the establishment a proud, powerful middle finger. 
The non-monstrous supporters of Trump mystify liberals. How could people who are not depraved, people who have a measure of decency, choose to align themselves with America¡¯s Mussolini and his hordes, no matter how deep and well-placed their grievances against neoliberalism, greed, and corruption, which is to say grievances against Clintonism? 
This liberal bewilderment bewilders me. 
One dear friend in particular comes to mind¡ªa brilliant fortysomething progressive of uncommonly sound judgment who voted for Ms. Bombalot. My friend was not among the liberal dupes who saw in Clinton a pantsuit paladin. She knew, for instance, that Hillary was the supreme embodiment of the American killing machine, a cowboy Crusader who, in the words of rightwing blowhard ¡°Morning Joe¡± Scarborough, was ¡°the neocon¡¯s neocon. . . . more of a sabre-rattler and more of a neocon than¡± any of the Republicans contenders for Slayer-in-Chief. 
My friend knew that not only did Clinton lustily back the wars that killed hundreds of thousands in Iraq and Afghanistan but that she also bayed for expanding the slaughter years after anyone with a few neurons or a hint of morality knew we should get our troops the hell out of there. My friend has expounded with eloquence on the idiocy of Clinton¡¯s push for imperial adventures in Syria, Lybia, and beyond, and she speaks just as fluently about the big fat kiss that Clinton slobbered all over the brutal right wingers who overthrew the elected government of Honduras. 
Matters domestic outrage my friend no less. 
Hillary¡¯s role in the awesome expansion of our Orwellian surveillance state is a horror to her, as is her incomparable whoring for big banks and fat cats. (I use the word ¡°whoring¡± androgynously: Clinton is outdone in financial hooking only by our current POTUS, the Prostitute of the United States.) Then there is Hillary¡¯s stalwart opposition to the Fight for $15, to Medicare for All, to forgiveness of college debt, to free tuition, and, companion to these, her ruthless despoliation of the working class via free-trade agreements (so called, of course, because they make labor free for the industrialists who own our country). 
The long memory of my friend holds a special place for Clinton¡¯s support of her husband¡¯s ravaging of black America¡ªthe punitive drug sentences, the broader war on crime, the evisceration of welfare. Nor has she forgotten Hillary¡¯s ridicule of the women who accused her sweet Willy not merely of serial philandering but of sexual harassment. (Do you recall Hillary¡¯s charming comments about, say, Gennifer Flowers: ¡°trailer trash,¡± ¡°I would crucify her¡±?) Few liberals could tell you, but my friend could, that as senator, Clinton herself once voted to wall off the better part of 1,000 miles of our southern border and that she declared herself ¡°adamantly against illegal immigrants.¡± And my friend has been near tears when holding forth on the greatest issue of our time, the devastation of our climate, on which Clinton has proven herself a vandal¡ªleading the sabotage of our last best chance, at Copenhagen, to mitigate our climactic disaster, nestling ever deeper into the cozy pocket of Big Oil, from which she peeks out now and again to ferociously defend the interests of the oilmen, the fracking barons, and the oil-soaked sheikhs who¡¯ve lavished her with money¡ªrapists and pillagers all, Kochs in all but name. And yet, knowing all this, my friend still voted for Clinton. 
She sympathized with the argument that the only chance for the Left to rise again is to kill off the rightwing imposter called the Democratic Party and replace it with a leftist party, perhaps a reincarnated Democratic Party, perhaps something else altogether. She saw the logic of denying Clinton her vote and giving it, as I urged, to Jill Stein or another protest candidate. But she could not abide throwing the election to Trump and so aligned herself with someone she knew to be vile on most issues of importance but who might once in a while do good on a few big issues like abortion and other women¡¯s rights. Millions of nose-holding liberals made the same choice Tuesday. 
Why then is it a mystery to them that other decent-ish people, people with no more hate in their hearts than the rest of us, allied themselves with foul Trump? Is it so hard to see in these members of the Trump Nation the other side of the same coin, voters who swung to a different brute because Clinton was more dreadful on issues of importance to them? 
The stocker at Safeway may loathe Trump¡¯s vilification of Latinos, Muslims, women, and on and on, but it was Hillary, not Donald, who shipped his $60,000 unionized factory job to Ju¨¢rez. For that matter, although she has no vote, try convincing the Pakistani mother whose child was murdered by a Clinton-backed drone that Trump is worse because he wants to ban Muslims from America. 
The prescription for understanding how non-racist, non-sexist, non-xenophobic men and women¡ªwomen, for Christ¡¯s sake¡ªmade themselves Trump¡¯s willing executioners, is simple:

¡°If we don¡¯t understand why that choice was made, we will all get fucked, soon, and not only in North America, but also all over the world!¡± ¡ª Andre Vltchek 
Since the results of the latest Presidential elections were announced, I am longing for silence, while the overwhelming cacophony of deafening noises is assaulting my ears, and in fact all my senses. 
Suddenly everyone around me wants to speak, to shout, and to declare. Lately, people who are surrounding me, as well as those who are far away from me are frantically watching the news, reading newspapers and browsing through countless political websites. 
My friends and comrades all over the world are poking jokes at the US political establishment, or trembling in anticipation of something terrible, even apocalyptic. 
Many are just having fun. Even some thoughtful and educated individuals are behaving like obsessive football fans: analyzing, passing judgments, and spending countless hours on the couch, in front of their television screens. 
Of course there are also many gigantic protests in countless American cities against the President-elect, Donald Trump, the 45th leader of the mightiest nation on Earth. There are some massive protests, desperate protests, and hopeless protests. There are also personal protests, resigned shrugs of shoulders and downcast glances. 
Overall there is a lot of noise. Everyone is speaking from the top of his or her lungs. Actually, people are shouting over each other. They want to be heard, desperately. While very few are listening. Very few also appear to be reflecting on what is being said by the others, on what is truly happening, on what has happened. 
Despite millions of words and images assaulting our brains from all directions, I know that something is definitely missing, something important, and even something essential. It is not just my analytical mind that comprehends this; it is also my intuition. 
As a result, I want to smash those television sets in my vicinity, I want to throw newspapers into the garbage bin, and I want to go away, far away, from all my politicizing friends and comrades. 
But what is it that is being omitted in the official and even in the alternative narrative? What is it that I want to hear, longing to hear so much ¡­ longing with such force, even with such desperation? 
Am I desperate for some precise analyses, for exact numbers, for revealing facts? Am I yearning for one brilliant study, for a report? Do I want to hear from someone why on earth did the American people elect someone like him, like Donald Trump? Or is it all actually much more simple and selfish: do I expect those wise words to come from my own brain, typed into my computer with my own fingers? 
How did it all really come to this? And why? What will happen now? What will happen to them (to the voters), what will happen to America, the country, which despite everything used to be my home for many years? What will happen to America which took so much, but which also gave me plenty? I kept asking, above all, what will happen to the world, to the entire world, which is now my true home, and which is also their true home (home of the American voters), although perhaps they do not fully comprehend it yet. 
No, I did not want to hear the facts! I couldn¡¯t care less about the numbers. I was not longing for analyses, and I felt absolutely no desire to speak! 
Suddenly, there was only one longing left in me: to listen, to hear, to absorb the millions of voices of those who just recently went to the polls and stuck those pieces of paper into boxes, most likely changing the destiny of the world. And since I knew I wouldn¡¯t be able to absorb millions of testimonies, I wanted to listen to at least a few hundred or even thousands of them if possible. 
I wanted to hear the stories of those men and women from the Rustbelt states, from the Deep South, from isolated farms and exhausted mining towns. I wanted to put my glass of beer next to theirs, in some god-forsaken bar, and just nod and whisper what so many storytellers before me, have done for millennia, and what they will be saying for many centuries to come: ¡°Please tell me your story¡­¡± 
I want to hear their stories so I can collect them, arrange them, and pass them onto the world. 
I want the people who voted for Donald Trump to speak to me, to explain, to let me into their thoughts and emotions. I want to understand what occurred through their stories. 
I don¡¯t want to judge. I am usually very judgmental, very political, and very ideological. This time I have no desire to be ¡­ This is too serious; too damn serious! 
I owe America that much. That is the least I can do. To return there, to fly there all the way from Asia, to rent a car, and drive from coast to coast, for long weeks, and to finally listen to people, trying to understand who they are, what they did, and why? 
¡°I am what I am because I am a passionate listener,¡± I was once told by one of the greatest Latin American writers, Eduardo Galeano. ¡°People always know what goes on. All we have to do is to listen to them. And we have to lead them only when they ask us, when they order us to do so.¡± 
There is no doubt in my mind that now is the time to attentively listen to the American people; to fill newspapers and websites with their words. But almost no one seems to be doing that. 
All we hear is ¡®why they voted as they did¡¯. How they voted: women, minorities, particular classes or states ¡­ We read about numbers. But we don¡¯t hear people speaking! We don¡¯t hear them formulating the words. 
And that is what I am longing for: to shut up, to be silent, and to listen. And I want other intellectuals to shut up and to humbly listen too, finally! 
Not because I agree with what they, the voters, have done. Not because I want Donald Trump to lead the country and the Empire. Not because I suddenly ¡®fell in love with the small people¡¯. 
It is simply because the people of the most powerful country on Earth have spoken, because they made their choice. And because, if we don¡¯t understand why that choice was made, we will all get fucked, soon, and not only in North America, but also all over the world! 
I want to listen and to understand so the course of action can be determined, so that we know where all this will lead ¡­ because this is not the end, just the beginning¡­ of something¡­ Because not only people in the United States, but also in Europe want something, and listening to the analysts from both parts of the world, and by just ¡®reading facts and numbers¡¯, I have absolutely no clue what it is! 
Do voters want some new form of participatory democracy? Do they want neo-fascism? Are they thoroughly selfish or is there at least some internationalist essence in their souls? 
We can only find out if we let them speak. And that is why I am longing for silence, and then for their voices to resonate, so we know, we know now, before the thunder and flames swallow our Planet, and before it is too late.",english,2016-11-17T14:27:48.133+02:00,darkmoon.me,ME,,Why Did They Vote For Trump?,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

JAGGERS LD: We discussed yesterday the various reasons why Trump won the election. Mr Jaggers thinks Trump won because he promoted the interests of the vast underclass of disenfranchised Whites who were sick to death of the (((neoconservative liberal elites))), as typified by the loathsome Hillary Clinton. It is in Trump¡¯s own interests, Jaggers believes, not to betray the Whites who voted for him by reneging on his promises. There must be no U-turns, no cuddling up to the Zionist enemy, no wishy-washy compromises or backslidings. Trump is now expected to ¡°make America great again¡± ¡ª or else. A tall order? We¡¯ll see. [LD] 
: In certain times, there is a surreal feeling of ¡°being a part of history,¡± which is perhaps to say, we are living in a time period of dynamic change. However unthinkable for the left it may be, Trump has been elected. We can add this to Brexit and other ¡°unthinkable¡± events to come. To contemplate the details of what this may entail, such as the selection of cabinet members and policy priorities , which do indeed include ¡°building that wall,¡± has something of a Christmas morning feeling¡ªeveryday. 
To paraphrase an from Die Welt , in Western Democracies, the status quo seems stable, and it is not generally considered possible for ¡°extremes¡± to transpire. But that is what we have seen, however we may want to quibble about what exactly is ¡°extreme.¡± Can Donald Trump, or the Alt-Right for that matter, be considered ¡°extreme¡± after that electoral show of consent? Regardless, when there is an endless back and forth between stultifying, uncourageous Republicans and the frankly anti-White agenda of the Democrats, ¡°extreme¡± does not carry such a negative connotation, but instead implies a kind of deliverance. 
We have been locked in a middle-class complaisance, and that is precisely why societies such as ours ¡°are often surprised by the foreseeable and obvious.¡± And alas, though it may be ¡°unspeakable¡± to liberals, and though he was the object of such ridicule in our media, Trump is now ¡°the most powerful man in the world,¡± as Die Welt puts it, perhaps with some apprehension. Just let that sink in. Explanatory Factors 
Trump¡¯s appeal may have been equally a reaction to Black Lives Matter protests as to immigration. According to exit polls, 74 percent of Trump voters feel that Blacks are treated fairly by the criminal justice system, which by definition means that these voters are not sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Overall, half of White voters (Democrats and Republicans) opined that Blacks are treated fairly by police. Likely most of us will have anecdotal evidence that our non-Alt-Right family members and acquaintances were not amused by Black Lives Matter. Trump voters were especially unamused. 
Of Trump supporters, 86 percent favor building the wall on the southern border, compared to less than half of all voters (54 percent oppose, 41 percent favor). So antipathy towards both Black Lives Matter and immigration can be said to have catapulted Trump to the presidency , in part by turning off mainstream middle-class White people, who are normally content with the status-quo. Moderates may not want a wall per se , but they also may not complain too loudly when it¡¯s being built. And again, Trump¡¯s actual voters want it built¡ªunequivocally. 
While losing some steam amongst college-educated Whites, Trump won the White working class by 39 points , an increase from Romney¡¯s 26 point spread. Ultimately, there is no simple narrative that emerges; Trump increased White support in different key swing states from different rural and suburban demographics in order to dominate the electoral college. I won¡¯t pretend to be Nate Silver, so let¡¯s just say he won because of White people. 
¡°Among his supporters,¡± opines Thomas Friedman on Real Time with Bill Maher , ¡°this was 80 percent about race, and the other 20 percent was about race.¡± 
Good then, let¡¯s accept the premise of liberals and draw the necessary conclusions. If Trump triumphed on the basis of race issues, he now has a mandate on immigration, law and order, the wall, etc. 
For the NYTimes David Brooks holding forth on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), Trump voters are ¡°just going with their gene pool ,¡± a rather bald statement that Trump voters are voting their ethnic interests. After the election, Brooks predicted that the country would be split into two factions, with one faction advocating ethnic separatism, what many on the Alt Right are already advocating. Would that it were so. 
Nixon became known to history as the ¡°law and order¡± candidate, which accurately characterized his proclivities vis-¨¤-vis crime. Trump, on the other hand, to leave no doubt, self-identified as the ¡°law and order¡± candidate. As liberals will complain, and as the alt-right will readily admit, ¡°law and order¡± is understood to mean that we will not tolerate Black violence and civil unrest. Trump¡¯s support, therefore, was premised on his intolerance for the very violence which his election has provoked (once again) from Blacks and other malcontent minorities, in the protests following his victory, which continue as I write this. 
It is ironic that Blacks report feeling ¡°scared¡± at the prospect of the Trump presidency, while they are in fact the progenitors of violence, and so far as I know, Trump never made any negative statements explicitly about Blacks. Their violence and disorder has indeed ¡°scared¡± the rest of civil society, contributing to Trump¡¯s election. Perhaps Blacks are expressing their fear by attacking innocent Whites, in this inverted reality. How can we assuage these sensitive Blacks¡¯ sense of fear? Shall we become human punching bags? You Can¡¯t Always Get What You Want 
If there is one thing that minorities have learned over the last eight years, it is that they get what they want, and Whites (perhaps as a natural corollary) do not. Hence the indignation following this surprise victory. 
Some journalists noted with amusement that Trump often played the Rolling Stones¡¯ ¡°You Can¡¯t Always Get What You Want¡± at his campaign rallies. I hypothesized that Trump liked the song for its beautiful choral section, which has a celestial quality that built anticipation for his arrival on stage. Surely he paid little heed to the message of the lyrics, which discordantly seemed to suggest he was voters¡¯ second choice. But now it all makes sense. I suggest that for our ¡°underprivileged¡± people of color, it¡¯s time you learned: you can¡¯t always get what you want. 
Not only is the People of Color (POC) attitude of entitlement and aggrievement ridiculous, it is also presumptuous. 
While the MSM claims that the onus is now on Trump to reach out to those who didn¡¯t vote for him; i.e., Blacks and Hispanics, it would seem that he was given a mandate to serve the interests of those who did vote for him . It follows logically that he would now carry that project through and enact the policies which mobilized his base and put him in the Oval Office. Sourced from the Occidental Observer Like this?

Problem has been favouring certain ethnic groups beyond reasonability. People are people. For example, employment should go to the best qualified candidate regardless of race or ethnic creed. An assumption is made on the government¡¯s part, that an employer will unfairly select Anglo Saxon over other races, which is wrong. Therefore, the employer must use race based quota agendas to effect equality. 
This is a form of dictating morality by an amoral government. This is one area that Mr. Trump ought to behove.",english,2016-11-18T14:09:52.817+02:00,darkmoon.me,ME,,Trump won because of White people,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Positive

FORGET IT! ¡°If that¡¯s what you think,¡± Kaminski says, ¡°you¡¯re kidding yourself!¡± 
President-elect Donald Trump¡¯s claim he is reinvestigating 9/11 is just so much meaningless hot air ¡ª more neocon crapola ¡ª if he intends to solve the greatest crime in American history by including two of the event¡¯s participating perpetrators ¡ª Rudy Giuliani and Lewis Eisenberg ¡ª on his team of detectives. 
What kind of truth can we expect from this kind of sandbagged scrutiny? None at all. Once again our government is investigating itself with predictable results. It will do no better than the first time ¡ª which was a total whitewash, because it is the very system itself that all these political functionaries are trying to defend which bears responsibility for this event and its impact on history. 
Hiring the people who played minor supporting roles in the 9/11 bloodbath to identify its architects and actors may yield a few sacrificial scapegoats like Cheney and some generals, but the top of the line power structure will remain solidly in place, hidden from view and utterly in control of world events. 
That Trump has surrounded himself with the tainted players who have carried out all these wars for Israel augurs for a dark future in which the militarization of America will further shrink individual rights, and the harsh crackdown on legitimate dissent ¡ª which will soon be banned ¡ª plainly signals the end of free speech as we have known it in the United States. 
Recall Thomas Jefferson¡¯s dictum: ¡°Freedom of the press cannot be limited without being lost.¡± Today, it is long gone. The press prints only what the government allows it to print. 
For Trump to hire such rancid refugees from the Bush administration means that he won¡¯t be investigating 9/11. Instead he will be crafting a new more realistic coverup that lambastes Saudi renegades and totally omits the overwhelming presence of Israeli Jews in all aspects of the tragedy ¡ª the same presence that now dominates the U.S. government and its criminal activities throughout the world. 
Preemptive war is criminal activity, in case you didn¡¯t know. The U.S. is practicing it everywhere under the cynical guise of fighting terror, which it itself creates by hiring thugs from around the world to fit into the proper terror slots and become believable enemies for the press to vilify and our military to bomb. 
The U.S. has literally slaughtered millions of people around the world at the behest of a small group of mostly Jewish men (and the gentiles they have bought) who control not only virtually all the money of the people in the world, but also control their thoughts as a result. 
Mayor Giuliani ran the command post in Building 7. You remember Building 7, that building that was knocked down by not being hit by an airplane. Giuliani knows everything that happened, and who did what. 
Eisenberg, one of the world¡¯s foremost financiers, was the head of the New York Port Authority who leased the Twin Towers to Silverstein. Silverstein, who spoke frequently with top Israeli leaders, wound up with $4.55 billion. 
The question with regard to Trump¡¯s integrity kind of splits down the middle since he seems to have a genuine desire to succeed and restore the peace, but he is indebted to forces far larger than himself, which he is now trying to placate by surrounding himself with the traditional pseudo Republican goons like Gingrich and Romney. 
If only they were genuine Republicans it wouldn¡¯t be so bad, but they¡¯re poseurs, all ultimately working for the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds. 
Business as usual in the Jewish American empire, gnawing on the fatted calf while   bleeds. 
Trump¡¯s choices reveal a desire to continue the swashbuckling sadism of the Bush Administration. Throughout his campaign I always shuddered when Trump would proclaim that we needed a stronger military, and I thought, tell that to the people beneath the bombs because they want no part of any of this. 
As a newspaper blows trivial events into earthshaking issues, so politicians identify all manner of enemies that demonstrate the desperate need for them to be elected. 
Like the Boston Marathon bombing that turned a mercenary drill into a region wide suspension of freedom of movement, the worst story possible is presented even as inconvenient facts are left behind. 
Think about the atrocities and false flag shockers that have been foisted on us since 9/11. Statistics reveal that more than 90 of significant terror incidents began life as FBI sting operations manipulating low IQ bigmouths into capital crimes. 
Why is it the cops can commit crimes against the people but the people can¡¯t commit crimes against the cops? This is not the kind of freedom we thought we¡¯d get while growing up. 
Trump certainly is not addressing any of these issues, and a Trump administration will merely continue the clumsy depredations and smokescreen lies that have exemplified the utterly corrupt and criminal nature of the United States as it is run by Jews bankers holed up in the City of London, and wreaking havoc throughout the world by their control of everyone¡¯s money. 
What is really needed is a full accounting of what the Jews have done to the United States, and restitution to United States citizens over moneys illegally stolen by the Federal Reserve Corporation to be taken from its stockholders immediately. 
Of course this is impossible because the Jews own the government and all the corrupt minions within it. One word from them and you¡¯re out of a job. 
The avaricious Jews are really only a reflection of the darker side of humanity. Like good sociopaths, they learned everything they know by mimicking others, and have become better than everyone else at what they do simply by practice and cooperation. 
They have never once considered that the fate of the world ultimately depends on treating everyone in the world as members of your own family, even as that becomes impossible on a continent overrun by hungry savages who were put there by these very same sadists who control the United States and its fearsome war machine.

In a November 2015 post on Breitbart News, Solov describes the conception of the news site in 2007. It happened, Solov writes, during a trip to Israel with Andrew Breitbart, the Jewish founder and namesake of the website. 
The site was born to defend the Jewish state. 
¡°One thing we specifically discussed that night was our desire to start a site that would be unapologetically pro-freedom and pro-Israel,¡± Solov wrote. ¡°We were sick of the anti-Israel bias of the mainstream media.¡± 
Solov and Breitbart were ¡°blown away by the spirit, tenacity and resourcefulness of the Israeli people on that trip,¡± Solov wrote. 
Breitbart died in 2012 and Bannon became editor of the site. 
Under Bannon¡¯s leadership, the site became one of the best known platforms and gateways for the alt-right, a diverse group that traffics in white nationalism and racism. Richard Spencer , a founder of the political movement who advocates for the creation of a ¡°white ethno-state,¡± called Breitbart a ¡°gateway¡± to alt-right ideas and writers. 
During Trump¡¯s campaign, the site became particularly enamored with the Republican candidate and lampooned and attacked his opponents. 
For Ben Shapiro, a former writer at Breitbart News, Bannon betrayed the original vision of the site¡¯s founder. 
¡°Andrew Breitbart despised racism,¡± Shapiro wrote on Monday. ¡°With Bannon embracing Trump, all that changed. Now Breitbart has become the alt-right go-to website ¡­ pushing white ethno-nationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness, and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers.¡± 
But even as the site may have appealed to anti-Semites, it retained its Zionist bona fides under Bannon. 
In 2015, Bannon launched a Jerusalem branch of Breitbart News, which covers events in Israel. It is edited by Israel-based American reporter Aaron Klein, another Bannon advocate. Klein, a Yeshiva University graduate, is also a columnist for the Jewish Press, a weekly newspaper with a conservative bent. 
Klein recently called the anti-Trump protests across the country a product of ¡°professional agitators¡± who are seeking the ¡°downfall of the U.S. capitalist system.¡± 
The activist Pamela Geller, known for her anti-Islamic campaigning, also counts herself among Bannon¡¯s Jewish allies. On Twitter, Geller defended Bannon recently, dismissing those who were characterizing Bannon as an anti-Semite. 
¡°He partnered [with] Breitbart ¡ª a Jew,¡± she wrote. ¡°He partnered [with] Larry Solov (after Breitbart died) a Jew. He worked [with] me ¡ª a Jew.¡± Then she added: #Zionist. 
David Horowitz, founder of the conservative think tank David Horowitz Freedom Center also came to Bannon¡¯s defense, saying Bannon does not have an ¡°anti-Semitic bone in his body.¡± 
¡°As a Jew who has worked for years with Steve Bannon,¡± Horowitz wrote in an email to the Forward, ¡°I can tell you he is not an anti-Semite or a white nationalist.¡± LD : For further proof that Steve Bannon is not going to do anything to challenge Jewish power in America or stand up to Israel, see this thought-provoking article in the Occidental Observer : Anti-Semitism as Political Assassination: The Smearing of Steve Bannon. I really do feel at this stage, though of course I could be wrong, that diehard anti-Semites and ardent White Nationalists are most unlikely to see any of their dreams come true in the foreseeable future. That¡¯s what makes anti-Semites and White nationalists the angriest people on earth: their dreams are constantly being shattered as they see the Jews becoming more powerful and tyrannical at their expense. Constant defeat leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. Like this?

Today Dr. Duke and Dr. Slattery talked about Hillary¡¯s clear acts of treason against the United States by providing massive shipments of weapons to Saudi Arabia at a time that she knew they were providing support to ISIS. Dr. Duke, if elected to the Senate, would be in a position to expose Hillary and push for her impeachment should she win (steal) the election. BLOOD ON THE TRAITOR¡¯S HANDS! 
Dr. Slattery discussed post-election scenarios. He noted that if Trump wins in a close election, a small number of Republican electors could be bribed to vote for Hillary, throwing the election to her, or even vote for Pence, throwing the election to the House of Representatives to decide from amongst Trump, Hillary, and Pence. Should Hillary win and Trump supporters feel the election was illegitimate, impeachment would be more likely.

(Photos by AFP) 
US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton¡¯s policy towards Syria would ¡°lead to World War III¡±, arguing that the Democratic nominee would drag the US into an armed confrontation with Russia. 
Trump made the warning in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, following Clinton¡¯s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ¡°safe zones¡± in Syria earlier this month. 
¡°What we should do is focus on ISIL (Daesh). We should not be focusing on Syria,¡± Trump said. 
¡°You¡¯re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton,¡± he said. 
On October 7, the Democratic nominee said a no-fly zone was required inside the war-ravaged country to stabilize fighting, a move that was opposed in Congress due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia, since a US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down Russian fighter jets should they enter Syrian airspace. 
Clinton also described the situation in Syria as ¡°incredibly complex¡± since the intervention of Russia. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at an early vote rally at Broward College in Coconut Creek, Florida, on October 25, 2016. 
¡°You¡¯re not fighting Syria anymore; you¡¯re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,¡± Trump said. 
The Republican nominee also referred to the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power as a second-level priority to defeating Daesh. 
¡°Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIL,¡± Trump said. 
Russia might down US planes 
Meanwhile, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also warned about the consequences of Clinton¡¯s push for a no-fly zone in Syria that could spark a conflict with Russia. 
Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, Clapper said Clinton¡¯s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria could lead to Russia shooting down American planes there. James Clapper, the US director of National Intelligence, speaks at the Council of Foreign Relations, on October 25, 2016 in New York City. 
¡°I wouldn¡¯t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they ¡ª if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,¡± he said. 
¡°I take stock in the nature of the weaponry that they deploy and why they ¡ª why they did that,¡± Clapper said of Russian weapons recently deployed to Syria. ¡°The system they have there is a very advanced air-defense system. It¡¯s very capable. And I don¡¯t think they¡¯d do it and deploy it unless they had some intent to use it.¡± 
During the third and final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her remarks on a no-fly zone that could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict in Syria. 
A foreign-backed militancy has been going on in Syria since March 2011, with a plethora of armed groups ¡ª each supported by one foreign country or another ¡ª fighting the Assad government. 
Since 2014, the United States, along with a number of its allies, has been leading a so-called anti-terror campaign in Syria and neighboring Iraq. 
Instead of helping to rein in the Takfiri terrorists, the air raids have killed many civilians, and caused extensive damage to the country¡¯s infrastructure. 
Iran has been offering Syria advisory military help. Russia, another Syrian ally, has also been conducting an aerial bombardment campaign against militant positions in Syria at a request from Damascus.

How they could steal the election from Trump even if he is announced the winner next Tuesday 
By Dr. Patrick Slattery ¡ª There has been a great deal of talk recently about the ¡°rigging¡± of elections. Trump talks about it, and then the media accuses him of being a threat to democracy by refusing to accept the will of the voters. Nobody asks Hillary if she will accept the will of the voters¡­ 
Of course, we know that our electoral system is unfair, biased, and even rigged at a variety of levels. Without going into detail, the media, which plays an absolutely crucial role in staging our elections, has abandoned even the pretense of neutrality. Ballot access is unfair. Campaign finance is corrupt. Electronic voting machines are vulnerable. Voting by foreigners and dead people exists, as does multiple voting by individuals. 
But one massive threat has so far gone completely unmentioned: the vulnerability of the electoral college to post-election shenanigans. 
What people are not aware of is that, under the Constitution, the president is not elected on November 8. The Tuesday after the first Monday in November is designated for Congressional elections. It just so happens that over the years all the states decided to have their electors to the Electoral College selected by the voters on that day. In the early days of the Republic, it was actually more common for state legislatures to select the electors, and the Constitution allows the state legislatures to determine how the electors are selected. 
It is actually the Electoral College that elects the president, and that happens on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, which this year will be December 19. On this day, the electors will meet in their respective state capitals to cast their ballots, which will then be sent to Washington to be opened by Vice President Biden before a joint session of Congress on January 6 of next year. Some of you may remember the scene from Michael Moore¡¯s Fahrenheit 911 showing Vice President Gore reading votes that elected President Bush, ironically denying the objections raised by some Congressmen to Florida¡¯s electoral votes, which Bush won over Gore amidst the greatest of controversy. 
So if this system is enshrined in the Constitution, what could possibly go wrong? Plenty. 
Unless Hillary goes into complete meltdown over the next week, a Trump victory on November 8 will likely be a narrow one in terms of the electoral college map. One very plausible scenario has Trump losing Pennsylvania but winning the rest of the main battleground states plus one of Maine¡¯s congressional districts. (Maine, along with Nebraska, allow for electors to be elected on a congressional district basis rather than winner-take-all.) Under this scenario, 270 Republican electors would be elected, a bare majority, while 268 Democrat electors would be elected. 
Notice I did not say ¡°Trump would get 270 electoral votes,¡± which is what we are used to hearing. The fact is that the electoral votes are not cast until December 19, and there is no guarantee that every single one of the 270 Republican electors would actually vote for Trump. Do you remember a few months ago how alarmed we were at the prospect of supposed Trump delegates to the Republican National Convention deserting Trump and voting for Cruz? It was only that Trump piled up such large victories in the final primaries that he had big enough majority of delegates to cause the Never Trump people in the Republican establishment to give up on rigging the convention. 
So who are these electors? Just as the method of electing the electors is left up to the states, the method for nominating the candidates for the electoral college is also left up to the states. Some states allow the presidential candidates to nominate their own slate of electors. Presumably, these people could be counted on to be loyal. But in other states the party¡¯s slate of electors is chosen at state party conventions and even electoral district conventions. 
As a young man I attended one such convention and had my name put into nomination as a Democratic elector. Myself and the other three contenders then made short speeches to the convention. The other three talked about being precinct captains or hard-working party volunteers. Then I gave a speech calling for the direct election of the president and the abolition of the electoral college. I got a huge round of applause. I would have easily won, but as a matter of principle I withdrew my name from nomination. 
The point of the story is that most of the electors are unknown to the public, typically cogs in the party apparatus, and not even necessarily high-level ones, and some of them may even be smooth-talking slicksters like me, unknown to the party itself. 
So how likely is it that one or more Republican electors would betray Trump? Such a person is known as a ¡°faithless elector,¡± and while faithless electors have never ultimately altered the outcome of a presidential election, there have been 179 faithless electors in our history. In fact, faithless electors caused the Congress to have to decide the 1836 election for Vice President. 
It is true that about half the states have laws punishing faithless voters, but in all but a few states the votes of faithless electors would still count. 
The nightmare situation would be after a close election the Hillary people, or the Never Trump people, could bribe or pressure Republican electors, some of whom may not like Trump anyway, not to vote for Trump. They could vote for Hillary, they could vote for Pence, they could vote for anyone else, or they could even abstain from voting. 
Then what happens? If enough Republican electors are cajoled into voting for Hillary (in the above 270-268 scenario, it would only require two), then Hillary gets inaugurated on January 20. If it¡¯s a tie, then the House of Representatives breaks the tie. Obviously, there have been Republican members of the House that say they won¡¯t vote for Trump for president in November, so there is no reason to assume they would vote for him in January. 
However, not only are Republicans likely to retain a significant majority in the House, but the voting for president by the House is not one vote for each representative, but one vote per state. This means that California, which currently has 39 Democratic representatives, would get only one vote, while Alaska¡¯s single representative, who is a Republican, would also get one vote. This heavily favors the Republicans and means that if Hillary cannot flip enough Republican electors to herself to win a majority of the electoral votes, she is finished. There is no real prospect of the House of Representative electing Hillary. 
But what if enough Republican electors vote for other people, Paul Ryan for example, so that no candidate gets a majority? Then the House of Representatives gets to choose between the top three vote finishers in the electoral college vote. You could get a coalition between Democrats and Republican defectors that would deny Trump the presidency and give it to someone like Ryan. (The same applies in the case that Mormon ex-CIA operative and never-Trump independent presidential candidate Evan McMullen wins Utah , which some polls predict is possible.) 
While none of the above scenarios may come to pass, we do have to face the fact that the establishment has so far stopped at nothing to try to defeat Trump, and so it is not too far fetched to think that they would try these tactics, especially if the November 8 voting produces a very narrow victory for Trump. The media could start inventing more reasons why Trump is uniquely unfit to become president and claim that the Constitution allows for these scenarios (which is the case), and that this in fact was why the framers of the Constitution created the Electoral College (which is not the case). 
It would then be incumbent on us to make it clear to the members of the Electoral College and the Congress that any violation of the people¡¯s will would not be tolerated.",english,2016-10-31T10:59:32.036+02:00,davidduke.com,US,,How they could steal the election from Trump even if he is announced the winner next Tuesday,0,https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,hate,Neutral

He also seemed to prioritize tightening the immigration law over immediately deporting all illegal aliens, which Doctors Duke and Slattery agreed was the proper strategy.

Dr. Duke and Pastor Dankof on Trump¡¯s America First Foreign Policy 
Today Dr. Duke had Pastor Mark Dankof as his guest for the hour. They talked about Donald Trump¡¯s appointments to his new cabinet. They gave low marks to Representative Mike Pompeo as the new CIA director for his past policy positions, although they noted his loyalty to Trump as a potential silver lining. They also panned Nikki Hailey as the UN ambassador, which however does allow Trump supporter Henry McMaster succeed her as South Carolina governor. 
The most hopeful prospect is Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii, who is a potential secretary of state. She has supported Trump¡¯s desire to reconcile with Russia, and has been the most vocal opponent in Congress of the Obama administration¡¯s efforts to overthrow Syrian President Assad. Her appointment would go a long way towards wresting control of American foreign policy from Jewish neocons and putting America¡¯s interests first again.

It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. Reports are circulating that the Clintons have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank , via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. 
This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself, Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn¡¯t plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. 
The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States , thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. 
Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office, he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server. All the way to gun running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi . 
President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million dollar seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016 , another non extradition country. 
Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama¡¯s purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams. However, over the last several months, these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true . Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has. 
The Bush family has been quietly buying property, as well with the purchase of 100,000 acres in Paraguay in 2006, yet another country good for the Bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime. If the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the Bush Administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on 9-11 , the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request. Apparently, if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous, the Bushes plan on getting out of the country as well.

Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote. 
Most Americans don¡¯t realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney¡¯s chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state. 
Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a quote from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times ¡­ 
¡°I don¡¯t know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,¡± said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens. 
Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney . 
¡°I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney¡¯s name,¡± Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House. 
She said that the first time she pushed ¡°Romney,¡± the machine marked ¡°Obama.¡± 
So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time. 
¡°Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,¡± she told Fox News. 
And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago. 
For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012. 
If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren¡¯t even worth mentioning. 
And of course this didn¡¯t just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country . 
The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again. 
In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper ¡­ 
Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes ¡°switched.¡± The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday. 
And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas ¡­ 
Gary and I went to early vote today¡­I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn¡¯t get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don¡¯t hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed. 
I don¡¯t know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that. 
A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas ¡­ 
Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone¡¯s vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit! 
And of course they weren¡¯t the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon ¡­ 
So is there a serious problem with the voting machines ? 
According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots¡­ 
Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters . 
Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a ¡°software update¡± on ES&S machines that otherwise ¡°omit one race¡± when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch. 
Let¡¯s keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump¡¯s column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done. 
But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else. 
Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are ¡°no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate¡°¡­ In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country: Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote Close to 3 million registered in multiples states Approximately 24 million¡ªone of every eight¡ªvoter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state 
But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled ¡° Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead ¡°¡­ 
Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. 
Americans overall are more confident that the nation¡¯s votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner. 
Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media. 
And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up ¡­ 
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia¡¯s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud. 
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. 
But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. 
Now that is a real ¡°conspiracy theory¡±, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn¡¯t so serious. 
During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it. 
The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us. 
And let¡¯s watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.

But beneath the cheering, a new emotion is taking hold among some Trump supporters as they grapple with reports predicting that he will lose the election: a dark fear about what will happen if their candidate is denied the White House. Some worry that they will be forgotten, along with their concerns and frustrations. Others believe the nation may be headed for violent conflict. 
Jared Halbrook, 25, of Green Bay, Wis., said that if Mr. Trump lost to Hillary Clinton, which he worried would happen through a stolen election, it could lead to ¡°another Revolutionary War.¡± 
¡°People are going to march on the capitols,¡± said Mr. Halbrook, who works at a call center. ¡°They¡¯re going to do whatever needs to be done to get her out of office, because she does not belong there.¡± 
¡°If push comes to shove,¡± he added, and Mrs. Clinton ¡°has to go by any means necessary, it will be done.¡±

At this point, no one can say for certain what will happen in the aftermath of November 8, but it is clear that millions and millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the status quo, troubled about the economic realities perpetuated by the Fed and angry that Hillary may be put in the Oval Office rather than a jail cell, despite a trail of corruption with virtually no end. 
How far will things go?

But beneath the cheering, a new emotion is taking hold among some Trump supporters as they grapple with reports predicting that he will lose the election: a dark fear about what will happen if their candidate is denied the White House. Some worry that they will be forgotten, along with their concerns and frustrations. Others believe the nation may be headed for violent conflict. 
Jared Halbrook, 25, of Green Bay, Wis., said that if Mr. Trump lost to Hillary Clinton, which he worried would happen through a stolen election, it could lead to ¡°another Revolutionary War.¡± 
¡°People are going to march on the capitols,¡± said Mr. Halbrook, who works at a call center. ¡°They¡¯re going to do whatever needs to be done to get her out of office, because she does not belong there.¡±

Nauseating. 
You should know that in 2011, Allen, then a 4-star general in the U.S. Marine Corps, was nominated to be NATO¡¯s Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, pending confirmation by the Senate. On November 13, 2012, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta suspended Allen¡¯s confirmation hearing, pending investigations into the general¡¯s ¡°inappropriate communication¡± with a woman named Jill Kelley. Gen. John Allen (l); Jill Kelley (r) 
As part of the fallout of the Gen. David Petraeus -Paula Broadwell affair, the FBI uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of correspondence ¡ª mostly email ¡ª between Allen and Kelley from 2010 to 2012. Reportedly, their correspondence was ¡°flirtatious¡± and ¡°inappropriate¡± as Allen and Kelley were both married at the time, but not to each other. 
Seriously, how can a 4-star general even have so much free time as to write 20,000 to 30,000 emails in the space of two years to ANYONE? 20,000 emails mean an average of 28 emails a day exchanged between Allen and Kelley; 30,000 emails mean an average of 42 emails a day. There is no one with whom I¡¯ve exchanged 28 emails a day, even less 42 emails. 
The upshot: Not only did John Allen lose his confirmation as NATO¡¯s Supreme Allied Commander, he also lost his job as Commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan ¡ª a post to which he was promoted to replace the disgraced Gen. Petraeus. (See ¡° Obama purges U.S. military command (Part 1) ¡±) 
Allen retired from the military in February 2013, but was appointed Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL (or ISIS) ¡ª a post and title created for Allen by Obama, which Allen held for about a year from September 2014 until October 23, 2015. 
Allen was a featured speaker at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. He criticized Donald Trump and endorsed Hillary Clinton ¡ª who abandoned four Americans to die in Benghazi ¡ª for President. 
Like the New Yorker that he is, Trump fired back, calling Allen ¡°a failed general.¡± 
Trump does have the endorsement of 184 non-failed and non-disgraced U.S. generals and admirals, including at least four 4-star and fourteen 3-star flag officers, as well as the endorsement of 14 Medal of Honor recipients. 
The endorsements began with an open letter on Sept. 6, 2016, from 88 retired U.S. general and admirals : ¡°The 2016 election affords the American people an urgently needed opportunity to make a long-overdue course correction in our national security posture and policy. As retired senior leaders of America¡¯s military, we believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world. For this reason, we support Donald Trump¡¯s candidacy to be our next Commander-in-Chief. For the past eight years, America¡¯s armed forces have been subjected to a series of ill-considered and debilitating budget cuts, policy choices and combat operations that have left the superb men and women in uniform less capable of performing their vital missions in the future than we require them to be. Simultaneously, enemies of this country have been emboldened, sensing weakness and irresolution in Washington and opportunities for aggression at our expense and that of other freedom-loving nations. In our professional judgment, the combined effect is potentially extremely perilous. That is especially the case if our government persists in the practices that have brought us to this present pass. For this reason, we support Donald Trump and his commitment to rebuild our military, to secure our borders, to defeat our Islamic supremacist adversaries and restore law and order domestically. We urge our fellow Americans to do the same.¡± 
Two days later on Sept. 8, another 21 retired U.S. generals and admirals joined the list, followed by 31 more the next day, on Sept. 9, and another 44 on Sept. 16, bringing the total number of flag officers who have endorsed Trump to 184.

Friday, newly surfaced video shared by one of Hillary Clinton¡¯s Hillbullies shows an Hispanic thug lay his hands on the brave woman and steal her signs, all while shouting ¡°GET YOUR ASS OUTTA HERE, B*TCH!¡± 
Other Hillbullies are then seen spitting on her signs and stomping them with their feet. 
As the innocent woman is seen frantically trying to protect herself from the terrorist thug, he violently trips her to the ground. 
Hillary supporting onlookers are then seen chastising her and as she lay motionless. 
¡°Didn¡¯t I tell you, about five minutes ago, that somebody was going to walk by here ¡ª and no I won¡¯t defend you ¡ª because you spewed hate, and you got hate,¡± one Hillbully says. ¡°You got exactly what you were dishing out, I told, I warned you on that, didn¡¯t I?¡±

Nauseating. 
You should know that in 2011, Allen, then a 4-star general in the U.S. Marine Corps, was nominated to be NATO¡¯s Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, pending confirmation by the Senate. On November 13, 2012, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta suspended Allen¡¯s confirmation hearing, pending investigations into the general¡¯s ¡°inappropriate communication¡± with a woman named Jill Kelley. Gen. John Allen (l); Jill Kelley (r) 
As part of the fallout of the Gen. David Petraeus -Paula Broadwell affair, the FBI uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of correspondence ¡ª mostly email ¡ª between Allen and Kelley from 2010 to 2012. Reportedly, their correspondence was ¡°flirtatious¡± and ¡°inappropriate¡± as Allen and Kelley were both married at the time, but not to each other. 
Seriously, how can a 4-star general even have so much free time as to write 20,000 to 30,000 emails in the space of two years to ANYONE? 20,000 emails mean an average of 28 emails a day exchanged between Allen and Kelley; 30,000 emails mean an average of 42 emails a day. There is no one with whom I¡¯ve exchanged 28 emails a day, even less 42 emails. 
The upshot: Not only did John Allen lose his confirmation as NATO¡¯s Supreme Allied Commander, he also lost his job as Commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan ¡ª a post to which he was promoted to replace the disgraced Gen. Petraeus. (See ¡° Obama purges U.S. military command (Part 1) ¡±) 
Allen retired from the military in February 2013, but was appointed Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL (or ISIS) ¡ª a post and title created for Allen by Obama, which Allen held for about a year from September 2014 until October 23, 2015. 
Allen was a featured speaker at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. He criticized Donald Trump and endorsed Hillary Clinton ¡ª who abandoned four Americans to die in Benghazi ¡ª for President. 
Like the New Yorker that he is, Trump fired back, calling Allen ¡°a failed general.¡± 
Trump does have the endorsement of 184 non-failed and non-disgraced U.S. generals and admirals, including at least four 4-star and fourteen 3-star flag officers, as well as the endorsement of 14 Medal of Honor recipients. 
The endorsements began with an open letter on Sept. 6, 2016, from 88 retired U.S. general and admirals : 
¡°The 2016 election affords the American people an urgently needed opportunity to make a long-overdue course correction in our national security posture and policy. As retired senior leaders of America¡¯s military, we believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world. For this reason, we support Donald Trump¡¯s candidacy to be our next Commander-in-Chief. 
For the past eight years, America¡¯s armed forces have been subjected to a series of ill-considered and debilitating budget cuts, policy choices and combat operations that have left the superb men and women in uniform less capable of performing their vital missions in the future than we require them to be. 
Simultaneously, enemies of this country have been emboldened, sensing weakness and irresolution in Washington and opportunities for aggression at our expense and that of other freedom-loving nations. 
In our professional judgment, the combined effect is potentially extremely perilous. That is especially the case if our government persists in the practices that have brought us to this present pass. 
For this reason, we support Donald Trump and his commitment to rebuild our military, to secure our borders, to defeat our Islamic supremacist adversaries and restore law and order domestically. We urge our fellow Americans to do the same.¡± 
Two days later on Sept. 8, another 21 retired U.S. generals and admirals joined the list, followed by 31 more the next day, on Sept. 9, and another 44 on Sept. 16, bringing the total number of flag officers who have endorsed Trump to 184. 
Below is the list, as of Sept. 16, 2016, of the retired U.S. generals and admirals, who are endorsing Trump for President and Commander-In-Chief: General Burwell B.

I am not doubting these examples of vote changing, but I am at a loss on how one ¡®knows¡¯ their vote was changed. Is there a tally on the machine? My township¡¯s machines have a paper ballot that feeds into a machine that reads the marked boxes. Not sure how I can tell if the machine is operating as it should or not. lloyd Lisco 
Touch screen voting. Terry 
Touch screen voting is heavily protected against these voter cause errors. When you get to the final page you may review your entire ballot, when you see the error it clearly tells you what to do to correct it. 
Generally these issues happen because the voter isn¡¯t focused on what they¡¯re touching on the screen and it¡¯s most often with first time voters or those who have difficulty using an electronic tablet. misterdawg 
This isn¡¯t BS, It happen to me when John McCain was running against Obuma. I voted a straight GOP ticket and when it came up to vote, It was changed to all Democrats, I had it changed and when we got home, I told my wife that I guess I had made a mistake and she told me that our son¡¯s vote had been changed also and he had caught it to, before he had push the vote button. They have stole the last two elections I believe and are trying to steal this one too. The corrupt News Media, is in the tank for the crooked Democrats. Terry 
How could they steal that which by your own admission you corrected? Where is the proof to your conviction of stolen elections or are you just ranting because the internet is free!

When you have 130% voters to number registered, Does that raise any questions in your small mind? Terry 
If they¡¯re not on the registered voter list, depending on the state they are generally given a provisional ballot that only gets counted IF it is found their voter registration was being processed or delayed because of a correctable error or need for verification.

On Monday, a man who voted for Donald Trump was arrested for wearing a T-shirt that referenced Hillary Clinton ¡®s comments about Trump supporters being ¡° deplorables ¡± to the polls. 
Brett Mauthe, 55, was arrested after he went to the polls wearing a pro-Trump hat and a shirt that read, ¡° basket of deplorables .¡± 
According to KSAT 12, Mauthe removed his hat at the request of those who were overseeing the polls. However, since the t-shirt did not violate the election code, he refused to turn it inside out nor remove it. 
Subsequently, he was arrested and charged with electioneering. 
KSAT 12 reports : 
Bulverde police Chief Gary Haecker confirmed the arrest but declined to release details. Instead, he deferred to Comal County¡¯s election coordinator, Cynthia Jaqua. 
Jaqua said the offense of electioneering isn¡¯t limited to people who stand outside polling places holding signs. Violations can be committed by voters as well. 
¡°It can mean a T-shirt, a button, a hat, you know?¡± she said. ¡°Anything related to the voting, the party, the candidate.¡± 
Jaqua declined to release specific details about Mauthe¡¯s arrest. 
Jaqua is quoted by My San Antonio : 
It¡¯s in the election code. Electioneering is prohibited within a 100-foot marker. You cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons, T-shirts, hats, whatever else or carrying signs,¡± she said. 
Most people who make the mistake manage to avoid going to jail, she added. 
¡°Every election we have to advise people. Even if it¡¯s a school bond issue. They wear candidates¡¯ shirts and we just have to remind them. ¡®Please go into the restroom and turn it inside out.¡¯ This is the first time I recall someone getting arrested,¡± she said, during two decades working at the county election office. 
¡°A gentleman did walk in a little while ago with a slogan for Trump, and when I asked him to please take it off, he was real nice, and took it off,¡± she added, while working a polling site Thursday afternoon in New Braunfels. 
So, according to this nonsense, a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day, but if a politician makes reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day? This is utterly ridiculous. 
My question on all of that is, what happened to free speech? Is that recognized as a God-given right in the First Amendment? I mean, I realize that the Constitution is to restrict the federal government, but honestly, shouldn¡¯t the states recognize the right of free speech, even in a polling place? Seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected. 
Other voters agree with me. 
¡°I don¡¯t feel like you should be preaching to anybody, but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate,¡± Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote. ¡°I¡¯m kind of shocked, because I think that¡¯s part of the freedoms that we¡¯re voting for.¡± 
Jose Tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are 18 and vote. Again, I ask, why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech? It¡¯s not inflammatory. It isn¡¯t a lie. It isn¡¯t slander. What¡¯s illegal about it? 
I¡¯ll tell you, politicians want to control people, and this is one of many means they use to do that. This is what happens when you don¡¯t hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose. 
Mauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media. 
¡°The reason I¡¯m not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around, and I don¡¯t want to give you any comment,¡± he said . 
The charged of electioneering is a class C misdemeanor.

So, according to this nonsense, a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day, but if a politician makes reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day? This is utterly ridiculous. 
My question on all of that is, what happened to free speech? Is that recognized as a God-given right in the First Amendment? I mean, I realize that the Constitution is to restrict the federal government, but honestly, shouldn¡¯t the states recognize the right of free speech, even in a polling place? Seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected. 
Other voters agree with me. 
¡°I don¡¯t feel like you should be preaching to anybody, but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate,¡± Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote. ¡°I¡¯m kind of shocked, because I think that¡¯s part of the freedoms that we¡¯re voting for.¡± 
Jose Tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are 18 and vote. Again, I ask, why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech? It¡¯s not inflammatory. It isn¡¯t a lie. It isn¡¯t slander. What¡¯s illegal about it? 
I¡¯ll tell you, politicians want to control people, and this is one of many means they use to do that. This is what happens when you don¡¯t hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose. 
Mauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media. 
¡°The reason I¡¯m not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around, and I don¡¯t want to give you any comment,¡± he said . 
The charged of electioneering is a class C misdemeanor.

Taking states that the media has tried to downplay as if Trump has no chance to win them, DML shows how Trump not only has a chance, but predicts he WILL WIN these states, and he backs up his prediction with solid data and facts. 
DML also clarified that the polls are extremely misleading. He said Trump has lit a spark in people who have not voted in decades ¨C some who have never voted ¨C but now they are embracing Trump. These people are not being included in the polls. 
Early voting is also not a true representation of what¡¯s about to happen, because more Democrats tend to show up for early voting, while the majority of Republicans wait until election day. 
WATCH THIS EYE-OPENING VIDEO for a critical state-by-state analysis that proves Trump can easily win the election ¨C then SHARE IT EVERYWHERE! 
**Note: In the video when DML talks about PA voting for Trump, he forgot to mention 100k Democrats in PA switched parties over the past year. In addition, PA saw an eye-popping number of new voters register as Republicans. Combined, PA in this election has 240,000 more Republicans than it did in 2012.

After it was announced that Donald Trump would be the 45 th president of the United States, Miley Cyrus posted a video online of her crying over the results. 
With tears rolling down her face Cyrus says, ¡°So, probably like most people¡ªwell, maybe not, because given the result¡ªmaybe I really am different and maybe a lot of people that I¡¯m surrounded by think with open minds and open hearts like I do. And I do want to say that I¡¯ve been very vocal for my support for everyone besides Donald Trump. Heavily supported Bernie. Heavily supported Hillary. And I still think that in her lifetime she deserves to be the first female president, and that¡¯s what makes me so sad.¡± 
¡°I just wish that she had that opportunity. Because she fought for so long and because I believe her when she says that she loves this country. This is all she¡¯s ever done. She¡¯s given her life to make it better. But, like Donald Trump so ironically played after his speech, it said, ¡®You can¡¯t always get what you want.¡¯ And happy hippies, we adjust and we accept everyone for who they are. And so Donald Trump, I accept you,¡± she said. ¡°And this hurts to say, but I even accept you as the President of the United States, and that¡¯s fine¡­because I think now I want to be hopeful.¡± 
She then went on to thank Barack Obama for ¡°everything he has done the past eight years,¡± and thanked Hillary ¡°for inspiring us.¡±

Angel Gilberto Garcia-Avalos is an illegal alien living in America who has been reported FIVE TIMES. 
He recently caused $61 million in damage after setting fire to a National Forest in California. 
This is the reason Donald Trump will win on November 8th. 
People are fed-up with these illegal criminals! 
From Washington Times: 
Angel Gilberto Garcia-Avalos had been deported five times in just the past four years, yet each time he has managed to sneak from Mexico back into the U.S., where he ended up in more mischief: driving without a license, attempted burglary and felony weapons charges. 
In August, he graduated to full-fledged mayhem, sparking a fire in the Sequoia National Forest that has already cost the government $61 million and left some of the country¡¯s most beautiful landscape scarred for years to come. 
Garcia, who pleaded guilty last month and faces 13 months in prison, had only recently been released from the Kern County Jail. He likely would have been deported again, but local authorities were unable to report him to immigration authorities because of California¡¯s new sanctuary city law, which prohibited the sheriff from communicating with federal agents. 
Thanks a lot, sanctuary cities! 
When Trump wins, these cities that protect illegals from the feds will not receive funding. 
Liberal policies harm us all. This is proof.

But no matter what happens on election day (Nov. 8), Trump will not win the majority of the black vote. Many of them are expected to heed the message of president Obama who has warned that the Republican candidate will undo his administration¡¯s legacy. But Trump ¡¯s message¡ªto make America great again¡ªmight still draw an unlikely group of supporters from within the black community: African immigrants. Foreign-born Africans make up a small share of the US immigrant population, but their numbers have been doubling every decade since 1970. African immigrants living in the US grew from 80,000 in 1970 to 1.8 million as of 2013, according to a study from the Pew Research Center. This group of voters say they are supporting Trump because of a blend of ideals that his candidacy represents: as the new flag bearer for conservative, traditional politics; a political outsider who has chipped away at political correctness; a successful businessman who has consistently reinvented himself to achieve the American dream; and a man sure to deliver them from what they see as the disappointing presidency of Barack Obama . Despite Trump ¡¯s anti-immigrant rhetoric, some African immigrants have been dissatisfied with Obama ¡¯s middling Africa policy and think real change from an outsider like themselves could make a positive difference for America their own fortunes. Leading this pack is none other than president Obama ¡¯s Kenyan half-brother, Malik. The 58-year-old naturalized US citizen, has spoken about his own brother¡¯s leadership as ¡°deep disappointment,¡± and said that Trump was ¡°providing something new and something fresh¡± to the American people. Some of the African Trump supporters like Malik have also voiced their concerns about the moral relativism that has pervaded US politics, from abortion rights to marriage equality, to the current debate on transgender bathroom use.

These days it has most certainly become chic for the modern liberal to throw about accusations of racism. Although this type of race-baiting has been going on for a number of years now, it became more noticeable during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. When these liberals accuse Donald Trump of being racist, they had better be careful for one specific reason: 
A leaked video from 2008 shows that during President Obama ¡¯s first campaign, he was also concerned about border security, and he even suggested a wall! Now, there is just one dominant question anti- Trump individuals need to digest: 
Is Obama a racist too? Because he was talking about some things you could easily accuse Trump of. Let¡¯s play a quick game. If you didn¡¯t know who said this, would you think it was Donald Trump in 2016 or Barack Obama in 2008? 
This man¡¯s core goal was to ¡°preserve the integrity of our borders to reduce illegal immigration.¡± Does this sound like Trump or Obama ? 
How about this one? This man said, ¡°additional fencing could help get our border under control.¡± Definitely sounds more like a GOP candidate than a Democrat one, that¡¯s for sure. 
Finally, this man also supported ¡°additional personnel, infrastructure, and technology on our border and at ports of entry.¡± Liberals would love to claim these quotes came from Donald J. Trump , especially considering he is the villain du jour in their lives at the moment. 
I hate to steal their thunder, but these quotes did indeed come from a young Barack Obama in 2008. Even he understood the need for a controlled border before the special interests in this country got to him. 
So, it is one thing when leaked videos show Hillary Clinton believed border security was important. It was entirely another when they showed that her husband thought it was important, but when liberal idol Barack Obama says it? Say it isn¡¯t so! Liberals just can¡¯t handle that. 
But anyway, folks, it is all about platforms. I¡¯m sure you have learned by now that Donald Trump doesn¡¯t get the free pass other politicians in this country enjoy. First of all, he is a conservative, so he is already someone every liberal loves to hate. 
Republicans have been so badly demonized in this country simply for desiring to get it under control. Luckily, people saw through the propaganda and decided that Obama ¡¯s brand was simply not working any longer. 
People are fed up with politicians who say one thing and do another. If you are looking for a reason why Donald Trump is the new president and not Hillary Clinton, there you go.

After a busy weekend interviewing job candidates, President-elect Donald Trump prepared Monday to begin filling out his economic and national security teams and outline his emerging White House agenda. 
¡°We¡¯ve made a couple of deals,¡± Trump told reporters after a weekend of meetings with with no less than 21 job candidates at his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J. 
Transition aides said they would release a video Monday in which the president-elect discusses plans and ¡°legislative priorities¡± for the Trump administration that begins Jan. 20. 
Topics include trade, notably Trump ¡®s opposition to the now-probably-defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership with Asian nations; energy development and ¡°job-killing¡± regulations governing shale and clean coal; national security, with an emphasis on cybersecurity; and immigration, including alleged abuse of visa programs to undercut American workers, said transition aide Jason Miller. 
Trump has more meetings on Monday, including one with Rick Perry. The former governor of Texas and ex-rival in the Republican primaries has been mentioned for a number of slots in Trump ¡®s Cabinet, including the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Energy, and Agriculture. 
The president also met with a fairly prominent Democrat: U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who backed Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primaries. A military veteran, Gabbard has been a vocal critic of VA medical services. 
In a statement released Monday Gabbard said ¡°while the rules of political expediency would say I should have refused to meet with President-elect Trump , I never have and never will play politics with American and Syrian lives. 
¡°President-elect Trump and I had a frank and positive conversation in which we discussed a variety of foreign policy issues in depth,¡± Gabbard said. ¡°I shared with him my grave concerns that escalating the war in Syria by implementing a so-called no fly/safe zone would be disastrous for the Syrian people, our country, and the world,¡± Gabbard continued. 
Also Monday Trump met with former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown. After the meeting Brown told reporters that he spoke with Trump about being head of the VA. 
¡°He¡¯s obviously going to take my application, or interest, under consideration. I¡¯m glad that he called. He¡¯s going to obviously meet other folks, and we should know, I would think, probably after Thanksgiving,¡± Brown said. ¡°I think I¡¯m the best person, but there are some tremendous people out there and I don¡¯t look at it as a competition.¡± 
Trump also met with Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin who said she was not offered a position but that the meeting was just a start.

Meine Tic-Tac-Packung von letztem November ist immer noch nicht aufgebraucht, weil ich so wenig gek¨¹sst habe. Was bin ich froh, wenn das alles endlich vorbei ist!"" Dabei kann Trump auch einer m?glichen Niederlage positive Aspekte abgewinnen. ""Selbst wenn ich die Wahl verlieren sollte, bin ich immerhin wieder frei"", erkl?rte er. ""Ob ich dann so richtig vom Leder ziehe und das Land in einen B¨¹rgerkrieg st¨¹rze oder einfach wieder wie fr¨¹her die nackten Kandidatinnen meiner Sch?nheitswettbewerbe ausspanne, wei? ich nocht nicht. Ich w¨¹rde aber auf jeden Fall das beste aus der Zeit machen und meine Freiheit genie?en."" Am liebsten w¨¹rde er jedoch die Wahl gewinnen. ""Selbst als ber¨¹hmter Milliard?r kann man sich nicht so austoben wie als US-Pr?sident. Das wird ein Feuerwerk!

Am Ende einer historischen Wahl in den USA steht Donald Trump als Sieger fest. Damit zieht erstmals in der Geschichte ein Clown ins Wei?e Haus ein. Demografen hatten zuvor angezweifelt, ob die amerikanische Bev?lkerung wirklich bereit f¨¹r einen Clown als Pr?sident ist. Mit seiner lustigen Clown-Per¨¹cke, seiner bronze-roten Nase und zeitlosen Slapstick-Einlagen bringt Trump schon seit Jahren Gro? und Klein zum Lachen. Vielleicht auch deshalb wurde seine Ank¨¹ndigung, Pr?sident der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika werden zu wollen, zun?chst von vielen als weitere brillante Performance des liebensw¨¹rdigen Milliard?rs betrachtet. Doch nun konnte der Spa?macher der ganzen Welt beweisen, wie ernst es ihm ist. Nicht zuletzt dank der Unterst¨¹tzung der US-Clown-Community. Fizbo Simmons, der Vorsitzende der amerikanischen Clown Society ist immer noch wie im Rausch. ""Wir haben das geschafft, was Comedians schon im Jahr 2000 mit George W. Bush geschafft haben. Jetzt wird niemand mehr ¨¹ber uns lachen!"", so Fizbo begeistert. ""Wollen Sie mal an meiner Blume riechen?"" Hart trifft Donald Trumps Sieg seine unterlegene Widersacherin Hillary Clinton.

November 2016 10 radikale Vorhaben, die Donald Trump sofort nach Amtsantritt durchsetzen wird Er wird der m?chtigste US-Pr?sident seit Jahren: Mit republikanischen Mehrheiten im Repr?sentantenhaus und im Senat kann Donald Trump die n?chsten vier Jahre praktisch durchregieren. Doch welche Pl?ne will der sympathische Milliard?r eigentlich genau umsetzen? Hier erfahren Sie, was Pr?sident Trump in den ersten 100 Tagen seiner Amtszeit vorhat: 1. Wei?es Haus zu Wei?em Hochhaus ausbauen ""Make America Great Again"" ¨C so lautete Trumps Wahlslogan. Anfangen mit der Greatmakerei will der neue Pr?sident direkt bei seinem Amtssitz. Das Wei?e Haus, auf dem k¨¹nftig in gro?en, goldenen Lettern ""Trump White Tower"" stehen wird, soll direkt nach Trumps Amtsantritt im Januar 2017 um 345 Etagen aufgestockt werden. Den lukrativen Auftrag zur Errichtung des Wei?en Hochhauses soll Trumps eigene Baufirma erhalten. 2. Austritt aus der EU (USAxit) Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten schnellstm?glich aus der EU austreten lassen. ""Es kann nicht sein, dass irgendwelche B¨¹rokraten in Br¨¹ssel dem kleinen Mann diktieren, welche Kr¨¹mmung sein Gewehrlauf maximal aufweisen darf! Ich sage raus aus dieser EU!"", so Trump im Wahlkampf. 3. Alles, was Obama je getan oder gesagt hat, r¨¹ckg?ngig machen Darauf haben Republikaner lange gewartet: Trump will alle Gesetze und jede einzelne Amtshandlung Obamas so schnell wie m?glich r¨¹ckg?ngig machen. Doch nicht nur das: Auch Barack Obamas private Leistungen sollen nachtr?glich revidiert werden, darunter auch seine Doktorarbeit aus dem Jahr 1991. Zudem soll eine im Jahr 2005 von Obama gerettete angefahrene Katze ausfindig gemacht und get?tet werden. 4. R¨¹ckzug aus Krisengebieten Donald Trump will, dass die Vereinigten Staaten aufh?ren Weltpolizei zu spielen und sich mehr auf sich selbst konzentrieren. Hierzulande wird das zur Folge haben, dass unsere Politiker behaupten, Deutschland m¨¹sse nun international mehr Verantwortung ¨¹bernehmen, was zu mehr Aufr¨¹stung und Kriegseins?tzen f¨¹hren wird. Ganz anders s?he es aus, h?tte Hillary gewonnen: Sie h?tte Deutschland zu mehr internationaler Verantwortung gedr?ngt, woraufhin deutsche Politiker bereitwillig aufger¨¹stet h?tten, um mehr Kriegseins?tze bew?ltigen zu k?nnen. 5. Burkapflicht f¨¹r alle Frauen, die keine Sieben oder h?her sind Diese Ma?nahme liegt Donald Trump besonders am Herzen: Alle Frauen, die von dem Milliard?r visuell weniger als sieben von zehn m?glichen Punkten erhalten, sollen dazu verpflichtet werden, ihre unf?rmigen K?rper k¨¹nftig unter einer Burka zu verstecken. Wer der Verh¨¹llungspflicht entgehen will, kann mit Sch?nheitsoperationen auf der Skala nach oben klettern. Verwechslungen mit Frauen aus der Gruppe der 3,3 Millionen in den USA lebenden Muslime sind ausgeschlossen, da sie am ersten Tag nach Amtsantritt geschlossen in Guantanamo interniert werden. 6. Alaska an Wladimir Putin abtreten Donald Trump will kein Kalter Krieger sein: Als Zeichen des guten Willens und der Zusammenarbeit mit Wladimir Putin will Trump den Bundesstaat Alaska an Russland abtreten. Trump ist an Alaska ohnehin nicht viel gelegen, weil die Frauen aufgrund des k¨¹hlen Klimas dort so gut wie nie sexy Klamotten tragen. Im Gegenzug wird Putin dann die L?sung s?mtlicher Krisen im Nahen Osten ¨¹bernehmen. 7. Umbau des Yosemite-Nationalparks in einen Luxus-Golfplatz Mit der Umweltpolitik seines Vorg?ngers Barack Obama hat Donald Trump nichts am Hut. Das erkennt man auch daran, dass er den ¨¹ber 3000 Quadratkilometer gro?en Yosemite Nationalpark in einen Luxus-Golfplatz mit dem Namen Trumpemite National-Golfplatz umwandeln wird. Den lukrativen Auftrag zur Errichtung des Golfplatzes soll Trumps eigene Baufirma erhalten. 8. Waffenpflicht f¨¹r alle Als kleines Zugest?ndnis an seine Unterst¨¹tzer von der NRA plant Trump schon in den ersten 100 Tagen seiner Amtszeit die Einf¨¹hrung einer Waffenpflicht (""mandatory right to bear guns"") f¨¹r alle US-Amerikaner, die imstande sind, eine Waffe zu halten. S?uglinge unter 6 Monaten sind ausgenommen, m¨¹ssen aber eine Kuschelwaffe besitzen. Durch die Waffenpflicht sollen Amokl?ufe und Schie?ereien in den USA endg¨¹ltig der Vergangenheit angeh?ren, da bewaffnete Wahnsinnige sofort erschossen werden k?nnen. 9. Steuersenkung auf 0%, um den verdammten Staat endlich auszubluten Um die amerikanischen B¨¹rger endlich vor der Tyrannei des raffgierigen Staates zu befreien und ein angenehmes Investitionsklima f¨¹r Unternehmen zu schaffen, hat Trump angek¨¹ndigt, alle Steuern auf 0 Prozent zu senken. Statt von einer milliardenschweren B¨¹rokratiemaschinerie sollen alle Staatsgesch?fte dann von einem B¨¹ro mit maximal drei Mitarbeitern bew?ltigt werden, das sich ¨¹ber einen eigenen Limonadenstand in der Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington finanziert. 10. Mauer um die USA Eine Mauer zu Mexiko reicht Trump schon lange nicht mehr, seit er geh?rt hat, dass Fl¨¹chtlinge auch ¨¹ber das Meer oder Kanada in die USA einwandern k?nnen. Darum will er das gesamte Land entlang der Grenzen und der K¨¹stenlinie mit einer 32.143 Kilometer langen und f¨¹nf Meter hohen Mauer umgeben. Das hat noch einen weiteren Vorteil: Nicht nur kann niemand mehr rein, es kommt auch keiner mehr raus. Den lukrativen Auftrag zur Errichtung der Mauer soll Trumps eigene Baufirma erhalten. ssi, dan; Fotos: Meistens Shutterstock; Foto Trump: Gage Skidmore , CC BY-SA 2.0 Artikel teilen:",german,2016-11-10T18:04:15.963+02:00,der-postillon.com,US,22680,"10 radikale Vorhaben, die Donald Trump sofort nach Amtsantritt durchsetzen wird",0,https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-15DfZsvC74w/WCSSs86vC6I/AAAAAAAAmDU/U69a4ShlNP496TPkIxyNqxDSbpSQ9aMogCLcB/w1200-h630-p-nu/100tage.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

November 2016 Vorbild Trump: AfD fordert ebenfalls Mauer an Grenze zu Mexiko Berlin (dpo) - Haben sie sich da etwa Donald Trump zum Vorbild genommen? Die AfD hat heute ebenfalls den Bau einer Mauer an der Grenze zu Mexiko gefordert. Offenbar hofft die Partei im Hinblick auf die Bundestagswahl im n?chsten Jahr, bei einwanderungskritischen W?hlern noch st?rker zu punkten, indem sie antimexikanische Ressentiments bedient. ""Die Mexikaner senden uns nicht ihre besten Leute"", hei?t es in einem AfD-Positionspapier unter dem Titel ""Deutschland wieder gro?artig machen"", das vorsieht, die Kosten f¨¹r den Mauerbau an der deutsch-mexikanischen Grenze vollst?ndig von Mexiko tragen zu lassen. ""Sie bringen Drogen. Sie bringen Kriminalit?t. Sie sind Vergewaltiger. Und manche, nehmen wir an, sind gute Leute."" Hat sich die AfD von ihm inspirieren lassen? Zwar betont die Partei in dem Schreiben, dass es sich bei dem Plan, eine Mauer zwischen Deutschland und Mexiko zu errichten, um ein v?llig eigenst?ndig entwickeltes Konzept handelt. Doch viele Beobachter hegen den Verdacht, dass die AfD vor allem deshalb mexikanische Einwanderer ins Visier nimmt, weil Donald Trump im US-Wahlkampf damit so beachtliche Erfolge erzielte. Auch wenn die AfD es offiziell abstreitet: Insidern zufolge ist die Forderung nach einer Mauer an der deutsch-mexikanischen Grenze nur ein erster Test, um herauszufinden, ob die Partei mit Trumps Methoden erfolgreich um W?hlerstimmen werben kann. Im Optimalfall st¨¹nden dann bald weitere Wahlversprechen zur Diskussion wie etwa die Abschaffung von Obamacare, eine strafrechtliche Verfolgung von Hillary Clinton oder die Neuverhandlung des Atom-Deals mit dem Iran. ssi, dan; Foto [M]: Shutterstock, Foto unten: Gage Skidmore , CC BY-SA 2.0 Artikel teilen:",german,2016-11-24T18:36:23.960+02:00,der-postillon.com,US,22680,Vorbild Trump: AfD fordert ebenfalls Mauer an Grenze zu Mexiko,0,https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-izpoEWVeKm8/WDcTXKjV9EI/AAAAAAAAmP0/Qjc_qIGtYI07lyB_wA1IPNqxpF8UvwsfgCLcB/w1200-h630-p-nu/AfDMauer.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

For weeks now all that has been posted with regards to the Presidential election is the lead that Hillary Clinton holds against Republican challenger Donald Trump. The mainstream press leads each day with an article or two on how Donald Trump has no electoral path to the White House. Could the political predictors working for the major networks and newspapers all be wrong? 
Yes, they are completely wrong, and wrong based on a basic and simple fact not being factored into their forgone conclusion. The fact being ignored is Donald Trump is winning the battle fought on the social media battleground. When 
Analyzed properly, it is clear that Donald Trump is getting all the attention on Facebook. Granted about half the comments he receives are positive, but Hillary Clinton's comments are almost entirely on the negative end of the commentary spectrum. 
Based on a thorough analysis of the Facebook chatter, it is predicted that Donald Trump will win 42 of the 50 states, including New York. This outcome is not only a landslide but an outright slaughter. Also understand that much of this data has been accrued before Hillary Clinton's current issues surfacing such as the Project Veritas Videos showing the DNC cheating machine in motion, the Wiki-leaks revelations, and the FBI reopening of the investigation of Hillary Clinton passing classified information on her private email server. All these scandals combined will only further erode any support she might find among the truly undecided . 
Another factor not being widely explained is that many of the polls affording Hillary Clinton her huge lead are also over sampling both Democrats and Independents. It is also not clear with regards to the learning of the Independents which is more likely than not, left of center. It will take a lot of dead voters and stuffed ballot boxes to bring Hillary Clinton close to the victory predicted by the mainstream media.

(New York Times Results by County) 
The media won¡¯t tell you this but Donald Trump CRUSHED Hillary Clinton in the recent election in three key areas: 
For one, the above results by county show that he picked up a significant amount of the counties in the US. The picture is clear that most counties in America voted for Trump . 
Secondly, the media is also hiding from you that Trump CRUSHED Hillary in the Electoral College (EC). As of today, most if not all media outlets show that Trump won the election with only 279 EC votes. But the truth is Trump also won Michigan with 16 EC votes and Arizona with 11 EC votes for a total of 306 EC votes. Hillary only won 228 EC votes but it looks like she barely won New Hampshire which should put her at 232 EC votes. As a result, Trump won 57% of all EC votes.

¡ª Dan O¡¯Donnell (@DanODradio) November 9, 2016 
Thirdly, in total states it was a landslide. Trump won 31 states to 19 states won by Hillary or 62% of the states. 
The mainstream will argue that Hillary beat Trump in the popular vote which appears accurate. According to the NYT she won 59,923,027 to Trump¡¯s 59,692,974 for a difference of only 230,053 or 0.4%. But in California and New York Hillary beat Trump by a combined 4 million votes. If not for these two huge liberal states, Hillary would have gotten shellacked in the popular voting as well.

Ford¡¯s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. 
That¡¯s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. 
It¡¯s also good publicity for Ford ( F ), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. 
Ford¡¯s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. 
The Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford¡¯s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. 
¡°Our investment¡­reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,¡± said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. ¡°Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.¡± 
The move comes at a delicate time for Ford. 
The United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. 
The union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasn¡¯t said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. It¡¯s also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs. 
¡°We¡¯re actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We haven¡¯t decided what will go there,¡± said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski. 
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if he¡¯s elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. 
¡°How does that help us?¡± Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. ¡°Mexico is becoming the new China.¡± ",english,2016-11-15T15:49:04.900+02:00,donaldtrumpnews.co,CO,,BREAKING: Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency Ford Shifts Truck Production From Mexico To Ohio,0.233,http://donaldtrumpnews.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/trump-ford.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Donald Trump hizo historia el martes al convertirse en el primer presidente naranja de Estados Unidos, con una rotunda victoria sobre Hillary Clinton impulsada por un mensaje de renovaci¨®n pol¨ªtica y social. 
El candidato republicano, de 70 a?os, hijo de una mujer blanca de Kansas y de un padre naranja del Condado de Orange (California), prometi¨® una nueva era de cambio y esperanza. Muchos de sus partidarios, como el reverendo naranja Jack Jessenson, dejaron caer l¨¢grimas de color zanahoria por sus mejillas melocotonadas.

El magnate asumir¨¢ la presidencia el 20 de enero, 51 a?os despu¨¦s de que se sancionara una ley que imped¨ªa votar a la poblaci¨®n naranjoamericana en muchos estados sure?os. 
El 45o presidente estadounidense ha afirmado que luchar¨¢ por los derechos de los ciudadanos naranjas. ¡°Racismo, no nos hemos curado de ello¡±, dijo en un programa de radio. ¡°A¨²n es com¨²n escuchar en la calle expresiones ¡®orangger¡¯ (¡®naranjucho¡¯, en espa?ol) con total impunidad¡±, constat¨®.

Positive Trump polls are coming all the time, so it¡¯s all hands on deck from the Democrats to do whatever it takes to hand the election to Hillary. Obama¡¯s latest move involves registering immigrant voters who will most likely be voting for Hillary in November and he¡¯s spent TONS of your taxpayer money doing it. From Judicial Watch : Months after the Obama administration spent $19 million to register new immigrant voters that will likely support Democrats in November, it¡¯s dedicating an additional $10 million in a final push as the presidential election approaches. The money is distributed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Homeland Security agency that oversees lawful immigration, to organizations that help enhance pathways to naturalization by offering immigrants free citizenship instruction, English, U.S. history and civics courses. Officially, they¡¯re known as ¡°citizenship integration grants.¡±[¡­] Judicial Watch went on to say¡­ The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been aggressive in promoting its citizen integration grant program this year, offering large sums to recruit new groups that can offer immigrants the services they need to become citizens. Clearly, the ultimate goal is qualifying as many immigrants as possible to vote since they tend to cast ballots for Democrats. ¡°We intend to award about $1 million to first-time recipients in the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program for fiscal year 2016,¡± the agency¡¯s grant announcement states. ¡°If you represent one of these organizations, or know of an interested organization, we strongly encourage that organization to consider applying. Additionally, another $9 million will fund programs that provide both citizenship instruction and instruction and naturalization application services.¡± Some might consider this a cash giveaway.[¡­] Practically every federal agency is participating in the effort by contributing resources and creating programs to help immigrants. For example the Department of Labor (DOL) is implementing ¡°new workforce programs¡± for the ¡°new Americans¡± and the Department of Education is promoting ¡°funding opportunities¡± to assure that the immigrants ¡°are provided the tools they need to succeed.¡± The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is collaborating with other agencies to release a career and credentialing toolkit on ¡°immigrant-focused career-pathways programs.¡± The Department of Justice (DOJ) and USCIS are making sure the new Americans have worker rights and protections and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is launching a two-year pilot to assure that non English speakers have ¡°meaningful access to housing programs¡± subsidized by American taxpayers. Obama likes to pretend that he¡¯s doing this for the greater good of America, but the truth is it¡¯s just part of the overall agenda to do whatever it takes to make sure Democrats run Washington and continue to drive our country into the ground.

Clinton campaign spokesman Jennifer Palmieri didn¡¯t mince words in describing how brutal Clinton¡¯s upset defeat was, according to The Hill. ¡°Thirty-six hours after the most devastating loss in the history of American politics, we¡¯re looking at a white board right now with lots of ideas,¡± said Palmieri said. ¡°We¡¯re sort of figuring out what we need to do this week, and what we need Democrats to do in the next two months ahead of the inaugural.¡± Other aides, meanwhile, tried to shift blame for the shocking defeat away from the campaign and onto the media. ¡°The media always covered her as the person who would be president and therefore tried to eviscerate her before the election, but covered Trump who was someone who was entertaining and sort of gave him a pass,¡± said Podesta. ¡°We need to reflect and analyze that and put our voices forward.¡± Podesta also pointed a finger at FBI Director James Comey, who resurrected the matter of Clinton¡¯s private email server in the final weekend. Podesta said the ¡°dominance of the way [the media] covered the emails¡± caused them to drown out issues like Trump¡¯s income taxes or his alleged links to Russia. The campaign¡¯s explanations apparently didn¡¯t do much to remedy the agony of defeat. Black began crying during the call, according to The Hill.

He has several names in mind, names that will literally change America and CNN doesn¡¯t like this at all. Well, too bad! VIA Conservative 101 According to Politico , some of those names include Gingrich for Secretary of State, Mnuchin, a 17 year veteran of Goldman Sachs for Treasure Secretary and Mayor Giuliani for Attorney General. And of course Sheriff David Clarke as the Homeland Security Secretary. He has been an incredible patriotic American and leader in Blue Lives Matter. CNN was terrified by this. ¡°I think the one major flag I have is that someone like Sheriff Clarke would be considered as his Homeland Security secretary? Someone who I very much see as if he¡¯s not a terrorist inciting terrorism?¡± said CNN commentator Angela Rye. ¡°If people are afraid of Sheriff Clarke, afraid of the policies which he represents, I think that¡¯s terrorism,¡± she said. This of course, makes no sense. You can¡¯t just call people who disagree with you terrorists. Check out the video below and see for yourself. 
Now, this makes me wonder¡­ what gives Angela the right to call an honest person like Sheriff Clarke a terrorist? Is it jealousy? 
You can¡¯t call someone a terrorist just because you don¡¯t agree with them. It¡¯s absurd!

That¡¯s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. It¡¯s also good publicity for Ford ( F ), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. Ford¡¯s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford¡¯s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. ¡°Our investment¡­reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,¡± said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. ¡°Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.¡± The move comes at a delicate time for Ford. The United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. The union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasn¡¯t said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. It¡¯s also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs. ¡°We¡¯re actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We haven¡¯t decided what will go there,¡± said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if he¡¯s elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. ¡°How does that help us?¡± Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. ¡°Mexico is becoming the new China.¡±

The fired staffers have gotten so desperate about their employment situation that Obama has brought in representatives from Facebook, Instagram and other companies to offer insights into the job market.

What happens when you get thousands of lawyers involved in the craziest election in modern American history? Unfortunately, we may be about to find out. We all remember the legal tug of war between Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000, and with each passing day it is becoming more likely that we could see something similar (or even worse) in 2016. In a brand new article entitled ¡° Clinton, Trump Prepare for Possibility of Election Overtime ¡°, Bloomberg discusses the armies of lawyers that Clinton and Trump are both assembling for this election. It would be nice if it was the American people that actually decided the outcome of this election, but if things are very close on November 8th it may come down to what the courts decide. 
Traditionally, there has been a lot of pressure on the losing candidate to concede to the winning candidate before election night is over. 
However, in recent elections this has begun to change. I already mentioned what took place in the aftermath of the 2000 election, and in 2004 John Kerry did not concede to George W. Bush until the next morning. 
And looking back at the numbers from the 2012 election, it is clear that Mitt Romney should not have conceded the race to Barack Obama so early. There was evidence of election fraud in key battleground states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado and Virginia , and many people out there still believe that Mitt Romney would have won if the election would have been conducted fairly. 
So when Donald Trump says that he may not immediately concede the election if the results are tight, I think that there is wisdom in that. 
A couple of weeks ago, it looked like we may have had a situation where Hillary Clinton could have won by a landslide . But the FBI changed everything when they announced that they were renewing their investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s emails. Since that announcement, the poll numbers have been rapidly shifting and now Trump has all of the momentum . 
For example, the ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll had Hillary Clinton up by double digits not too long ago, but now it is showing a one point lead for Trump . 
The race is very close at this point, and if the race to 270 electoral votes is razor tight on election night, I don¡¯t anticipate that either candidate will be eager to concede. We could see a prolonged legal battle ensue, and that could mean that we don¡¯t have a new president until long after election day is over. 
Already, both campaigns are assembling large armies of lawyers. In fact, Bloomberg is reporting that Clinton already has ¡°thousands of lawyers¡± that have donated their time to her campaign¡­ 
Clinton is assembling a voter protection program that has drawn thousands of lawyers agreeing to lend their time and expertise in battleground states, though the campaign isn¡¯t saying exactly how many or where. It is readying election observers in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada and Arizona to assess any concerns ¡ª including the potential for voter intimidation ¡ª and to verify normal procedures. 
The Republican National Lawyers Association, which trains attorneys in battleground states and in local jurisdictions where races are expected to be close, aims to assemble 1,000 lawyers ready to monitor polls and possibly challenge election results across the country. Hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, one of Trump¡¯s biggest backers, has sunk $500,000 into the group, its biggest donation in at least four presidential elections, Internal Revenue Service filings show. 
And most Americans don¡¯t realize this, but Reuters is reporting that the Democrats have already filed election-related lawsuits in four key swing states¡­ 
Democratic Party officials sued Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in four battleground states on Monday, seeking to shut down a poll-watching effort they said was designed to harass minority voters in the Nov. 8 election . 
In lawsuits filed in federal courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona and Ohio, Democrats argued that Trump and Republican Party officials were mounting a ¡°campaign of vigilante voter intimidation¡± that violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and an 1871 law aimed at the Ku Klux Klan. 
Meanwhile, the legal challenges for the Clinton campaign continue to mount. The renewed investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s mishandling of classified documents is just one of five FBI investigations that are currently looking into the conduct of ¡°Clinton¡¯s inner circle¡± ¡­ 
There are, in fact, not one but five separate FBI investigations which involve members of Clinton¡¯s inner circle or their closest relatives ¨C the people at the center of what has come to be known as Clintonworld. 
The five known investigations are into: Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin¡¯s estranged husband sexting a 15-year-old; the handling of classified material by Clinton and her staff on her private email server; questions over whether the Clinton Foundation was used as a front for influence-peddling; whether the Virginia governor broke laws about foreign donations; and whether Hillary¡¯s campaign chairman¡¯s brother did the same. 
Despite everything that we already know about Hillary, about half the country still plans to vote for her. 
If the American people willingly choose to elect the most corrupt presidential candidate in our history, it may be a sign that the events that I talk about in my new book are a lot closer than many people had originally been anticipating. 
But the good news is that a Clinton victory is looking a whole lot less likely than it was just a week or two ago. 
Could it be possible that the FBI has just delivered the ¡° miracle ¡± that Donald Trump desperately needed? 
Americans are more emotionally invested in this presidential campaign than they have been in any presidential campaign since at least 1980. Many of those that are backing Trump will be emotionally devastated if he does not win on November 8th, but if Trump does win we are likely to see the radical left throw a political temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. 
Earlier today, I shared with my readers the amazing fact that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old during his first full day in the White House if he wins the election. 
Many conservatives are fully convinced that it is Donald Trump¡¯s destiny to be president. 
Personally, I do not know what is going to happen. But with a race this close, it may be the courts that end up deciding who our next president is, and that is an outcome that none of us should want to see.

May 21st, 2015 
All over the globe, people are recording extremely loud sounds coming from the sky. In many instances, these ominous noises sound like someone is blowing a trumpet. So what are we supposed to make of these ¡°apocalyptic¡± sounds? Should we be concerned? Well, what we do know is that this is truly a global phenomenon. In addition to being heard at locations all over the United States and Canada, these sounds have also been recorded in Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Sweden, England, Costa Rica, Ukraine and France. If you go to YouTube and type in ¡°strange sounds¡±, you will literally get hundreds of results from all over the planet. Of course there are many scientists that insist that there must be a ¡°rational explanation¡± for these strange sounds. Some theories have suggested fracking, ¡°rock bursts¡±, venting of high-pressure gas, atmospheric pressure or the natural ¡°background noise¡± of our planet as the causes of these sounds, but so far none of those theories have been proven. But two things seem certain ¨C these noises sure are creepy, and they just keep on happening. 
And this phenomenon is now really starting to get a whole lot of attention. Just within the last month, there have been headlines about it in major new sources all over the planet. For instance, the following is a brief excerpt about this phenomenon from an article in the New York Post ¡­ 
Video clips from around the world have captured an evil-sounding ¡®trumpet¡¯ noise coming from the sky ¡ª but no one can explain exactly what it is. 
A number of people have filmed the bizarre sound over the past 10 years with the latest coming from Germany. 
Video of this most recent incident that happened in Germany is posted below. What do you think could possibly be making this noise? ¡­ 
As I discussed above, similar sounds have been recorded all over the globe in recent years. Very quickly, let me share four examples with you that were recently included in an article by Melissa Dykes . 
This first one comes from British Columbia, Canada ¡­ 
This next one was recorded in Allen, Texas ¡­ 
Similar sounds have also been heard all the way on the other side of the planet. This example comes from Queensland, Australia ¡­ 
Lastly, this next remarkable video comes from Melbourne, Australia ¡­ 
Personally, I have no idea what is causing these sounds. But so many people around the world are experiencing them that it seems to rule out a hoax. 
So how can we explain them? 
The following theories were put forward by the Daily Mail ¡­ 
Tectonic plates grinding ¨C Tectonic plates are pieces of the Earth¡¯s crust and uppermost mantle, together referred to as the lithosphere. The plates are around 100 km (62 mi) thick and consist of two principal types of material: oceanic crust (also called sima from silicon and magnesium) and continental crust (sial from silicon and aluminium). 
Atmospheric pressure ¨C Atmospheric pressure is defined as the force per unit area exerted against a surface by the weight of the air above that surface. 
Trains shunting ¨C Self explanatory ¨C noise comes from trains in reaction to the track and overhead wires. 
Construction ¨C Building works, especially if going on at the same time across a specific area, can led to similar sounds. 
Aliens ¨C Can this be an alien lifeform in the sky, perhaps scouring out Earth? 
HAARP weapon ¨C Rumours persist that the U.S. government uses secret weapons in the sky for defence and weather modifying, the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP). This wouldn¡¯t explain the sounds in other countries however¡­ 
The Apocalypse and the Seven Trumpets of Heaven ¨C Seven trumpets are sounded, one at a time, to cue apocalyptic events that were seen in the vision of the Revelation of Christ Jesus, by John of Patmos. Somewhat more worrying as it would signal the end of the world¡­ 
The scientists at NASA have a different explanation. What they think is being heard is simply the natural background noise that our planet is constantly producing¡­ 
According to NASA, it could be the earth¡¯s ¡®background noise¡¯. 
A statement from the agency said: ¡®If humans had radio antennas instead of ears, we would hear a remarkable symphony of strange noises coming from our own planet. Scientists call them ¡°tweeks,¡± ¡°whistlers¡± and ¡°sferics.¡± 
¡®They sound like background music from a flamboyant science fiction film, but this is not science fiction. Earth¡¯s natural radio emissions are real and, although we¡¯re mostly unaware of them, they are around us all the time.¡¯ 
To me, that explanation by NASA doesn¡¯t really ring true, but I don¡¯t have a really good explanation either. 
So what do you think? 
Do you believe that you know what is causing these strange sounds? 
Please feel free to share your thoughts by posting a comment below¡­ 
Effing creepy at that. Just Truth 
The article that said that HAARP can be ruled out isn¡¯t correct. It says: ¡°This wouldn¡¯t explain the sounds in other countries however¡­¡± 
HAARP was developed to advance nonlethal weapons in other countries, and works by bouncing frequencies off the ionosphere, thus being able to direct them to any part of the globe. naked swimmer 
Also all the millions of other energies going into the air could be causing noises. Just think of all the antennas going up every year & satellites being launched !! 
In the book Toxic Electricity 2nd ed. it says that one thing that could be causing colony collapse disorder is wireless energy. Visible light is way less than 1% of the spectrum. 
Toxic Electricity & Dirty Electricity are interesting books. People don¡¯t realize how much impact electricity & wireless is having on the environment. kfilly 
I believe this is a sign of the end times. There are too many things that seem to be lining up with the book of Revelations (global government, wars/rumors of wars, disease, famine, and the proposed digital currency by Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase). The bible was written way before this, and events are mirroring what has been predicted a very, very long time ago. jaxon64

The number one sign is Israel becoming a nation again in 1948, after years of being dispersed all over the World, the Jews are gradually returning home; And they are speaking their Hebrew language again after 2,000 years. One major sign that this is the last days is that the World is turning against Israel and what for: Because they will not give up that little tiny speck of real estate that you have to get a magnifying glass to see it on the Middle East map, that is IF you can find a Middle East map with Israel listed on it anymore. I have posted the land owners in the Middle East many times for ALL to see; But the Anti-Israel Haters will not admit the TRUTH when it is before them. I am posting it one more time below: 
Square land 0.6 of 1.0% 8,059 Million Arabia¡¯s 756,981 29.2 Million Iraq¡¯s Iran¡¯s land 636,374 76 Million There has never been a Palestinian people. This is something that the Romans did when they conquered Jerusalem from the Jews. These so called Palestinians are Arabs; They are not Jews and do not belong in Israel or Jerusalem. They belong with their own people. folgers22 
This story is spooky, but when I listen to the sounds on the videos, they don¡¯t really sound like trumpets to me. I would love to hear majestic music from the skies, because I know what that would mean, but what I hear sounds more like industrial equipment or slow-moving trains and other man-made noises.¨C I wouldn¡¯t want to stampede to an assumption on this one. Did anyone see that movie, Red State, where a group of Christians stops dead in their tracks when they hear a booming trumpet from the skies and assume it¡¯s the end of the world, not realizing some college kids down the road are fooling around with an iPod full of trumpet mp3s and a firestation siren horn? (There¡¯s a lot more to the plot, but that twist at the end seems oddly apropos here.)¨C My town is a nexus point for several different railroad lines and several switching yards and a commuter rail line. I hear a lot of trains during the day and night. Some of these sounds remind me of the sounds I hear when they¡¯re shunting trains back and forth and moving the big heavy cargo trains through slowly, especially at night when there aren¡¯t as many competing sounds.¨C I am not an expert on the atmosphere and what it might be able to do with sound, but I do know it can have an effect on sound. For instance, I¡¯ve always heard you can hear noises easier across open water than through the woods.¨C It also has an effect on radio waves. Folks who know radio know the layers of the atmosphere can do strange things with radio waves. For instance, when the weather is right, you can pick up an AM radio station transmitting hundreds or thousands of miles away when the signal bounces off the troposphere down to you somewhere over the horizon.¨C Last year, I read an article explaining how changes in temperature at different altitudes can warp visible light. The article explained the Titanic might have sunk within visual range of the Carpathia, but due to the effects of cold and warm layers of air, witnesses saw something totally different from the largest cruiseship in the world sinking 5 miles away.¨C So I wonder if sound can react the same way; originating from one point, bouncing around from one temperature layer to another, then coming down elsewhere distorted and unrecognizable as these sounds? Sandbagger 
You have the best explanation I¡¯ve heard. Trumpets from God it¡¯s not. Do I believe God when he says he will use trumpets? Yes. But I believe what another poster said¡­there will be NO DOUBT as to them BEING TRUMPETS. 
The wild-eyed proclamations that these sounds are THOSE final trumpets only serve to make Christians look nutty. Perhaps that is one interpretation of the scripture: 
Ephesians 4:14 (KJV) That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; folgers22 
Thank you! I feel exactly the same way-if it really happens, it will be incontrovertible, unarguable, definite 100% honest-to-goodness trumpets. If this were truly the work of God, why would it be spread out over the course of years in different places and why would it sound so mundane?¨C You would think an omnipotent omniscient being would be able to sound real trumpets simultaneously everywhere worldwide and ensure not one of us would be able to miss it.¨C I wouldn¡¯t be surprised if/when the day comes that you even hear the trumpets inside, even over your iPod. I don¡¯t think He would let a single one of us escape the message.¨C I think if you go with Occam¡¯s Razor and look for the most likely explanation, peculiar atmospherics+terrestrial sound makes the most sense.

Until something actually happens, they¡¯re just noises. Was looking for Jesus in the clouds, but he didn¡¯t return, again! In current news, a major oil spill in California, 9 miles of a beach covered. So we¡¯ll see if gas prices go up. It¡¯s about time for a gas spike. Mike 
Well, if you read the book of Revelation, you¡¯ll see that Jesus comes back at the end in an event called the Day of Lord or the Second Coming. Before Jesus returns you will see the rise of the Antichrist and a one world government. And when all nations go to attack Jerusalem under the antichrist¡¯s rule, Jesus will return. No pretribulation rapture is coming. We¡¯re all going to go through it (Christian and Non-Christian) if indeed we are in the last of the last days. HumbleAmerican 
As I stated below, I apologize for bringing Jesus in to the conversation. It has nothing to do with the article, and was wrong of me. 
I would agree. We are all in this sh** storm together. Hold on tight, endure to the end and PRAY! uisconfruzed

This topic is so touchy but my husband and I were just discussing this earlier this evening so here goes. My husband contends that if one of the major goals of the anti-christ is to kill Jews and Christians, how is it possible for the catching up to happen before the anti-christ comes on the scene, who would he kill if we were all gone? Why are there so many warnings and signs described in the Bible if there were no Christians left here to heed them? Is our catching up in the clouds going to happen simultaneously to Christ¡¯s coming to defeat anti-christ or prior to that time. Sheesh, I have been studying the bible for almost 40 years and I still can¡¯t definitively say anything other than Pre-Wrath rapture. algol2000 
There isn¡¯t going to be any rapture. He who endures to the end shall be saved. Joe Woolf 
I agree¡­.. We¡¯re all going at the 7th trump together. ( that¡¯s the last trump ) 
It¡¯s a touchy topic around many Christians but, I don¡¯t believe there will be any ¡°rapture¡± happening before the last trump. David 
You know, for having the Screen name ¡®HumbleAmerican¡¯ you could sure use some humbling. What I mean by that is, if all you¡¯re worried about is gas prices than you need a major wake-up call, brother! Just look around what¡¯s going on in the world today, and you¡¯ll see that there are Volcanoes erupting, along with Earthquakes and diseases, wars AND rumors of more wars to come. 
I also heard the sound, what I believe is a Trumpet blasting off. It was the 19th of April, and I was discussing with my daughter about how so many people aren¡¯t considering the facts that are being presented right in front of them; ignoring what may be to ensure their own happiness, and self-security. We may soon be at Civil or Foreign or BOTH in this country! Soon after I had gotten done telling it to her, the trumpet sound was coming from outside. She walked to the door and opened it up more, and said silently, ¡°It sounds like there¡¯s a war going on right now.¡± That¡¯s when I got up and walked to the door to hear it sounding off.

This is NOT what most social conservatives were expecting. Like millions of other Americans, I greatly celebrated when Donald Trump pulled off a miracle on election night. But within a week of his stunning election victory, many social conservatives already feel like they are being stabbed in the back. On Sunday, 60 Minutes aired a post-election interview with Trump in which he explained that his stance on gay marriage is that it is ¡°settled¡± and that he has no plans to try to overturn the Supreme Court decision legalizing it. According to CNN , this answer ¡°could leave conservatives worried¡±¡­ 
For the first time since winning the election, Donald Trump has weighed in on two of the most controversial social issues the Supreme Court has taken on ever: gay marriage, and abortion. 
His answers could leave conservatives worried. 
Trump indicated he¡¯s ¡°fine¡± with the high court¡¯s opinion legalizing same-sex marriage and called it ¡°settled,¡± but committed to appointing justices who want to change the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling affirming abortion rights. 
CNN¡¯s article didn¡¯t fully capture the flavor of what Trump actually said. A Mediaite article contained more extended quotes¡­ 
¡°It¡¯s irrelevant because it was already settled. It¡¯s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court,¡± Trump said bluntly on 60 Minutes . 
¡°I mean, it¡¯s done¡­¡± he continued. ¡°These cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They¡¯ve been settled, and I¡¯m fine with that.¡± 
You can see Trump making these comments for yourself right here . It is simply not accurate for Trump to say that gay marriage is ¡°settled¡± while Roe v. Wade is not. In the legal world, nothing is ever really ¡°settled¡±. 
Just like Roe v. Wade, Trump could publicly commit to appointing Supreme Court justices that would overturn the legalization of gay marriage. 
And without a doubt, the people that elected him were counting on him to do something about it. 
But the truth is that he doesn¡¯t want to do something about it. 
Donald Trump is ¡°fine¡± with gay marriage, and so that political battle is now officially over. 
For social conservatives, gay marriage is one of the Big Three. Abortion and Israel are the other two ¡°red line issues¡±, and since the election Donald Trump has also had some extremely disturbing remarks about Israel. 
In fact, Trump just told the Wall Street Journal that a peace agreement that would permanently divide the land of Israel into two states would be ¡°the ultimate deal¡± and that he is very interested in trying to make that happen ¡°for humanity¡¯s sake¡± . 
Could it be possible that social conservatives have been betrayed again? 
Could it be possible that Donald Trump was just another politician that was willing to say anything to get elected? 
So far Trump has not appointed any prominent evangelical Christians to any important posts, but it is being reported that Trump is considering ¡°an openly gay man to represent the US at the United Nations¡±¡­ 
  is considering a woman to run the Republican Party and an openly gay man to represent the US at the United Nations, moves that would inject diversity into a Trump team. 
The incoming president is considering Richard Grenell as United States ambassador to the United Nations. If picked and ultimately confirmed by the Senate, he would be the first openly gay person to fill a Cabinet-level foreign policy post. Grenell previously served as US spokesman at the U.N. under former President George W. Bush¡¯s administration. 
And let us not forget that Trump has already publicly sided with the transgender community in the bathroom wars ¡­ 
Trump, who has spent his life in liberal New York City, referred to LGBT Republicans at the Republican National Convention and said during his campaign that transgender people should use whatever bathroom they feel comfortable using. 
So did Trump just use social conservatives to get elected just like George W. Bush did? 
Now that the election is over, Trump is even calling the Clintons ¡°good people¡± ¡­ 
Clinton ¡°did some bad things,¡± he said, but added that ultimately the Clintons are ¡°good people.¡± 
¡°I don¡¯t want to hurt them, I don¡¯t want to hurt them,¡± he said. ¡°They¡¯re, they¡¯re good people. I don¡¯t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.¡± 
Is he serious? 
That is like calling the Nazis ¡°good people¡±. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt politician that   seen, and no politician in America has done more to promote abortion than she has. 
Perhaps he has a different definition of ¡°good¡± than the rest of us do. 
Of course a whole lot of social conservatives will get really upset when they read this article and at least a few will post comments staunchly defending Donald Trump and his positions on these issues. 
I don¡¯t care who it is ¨C when our politicians come out in favor of gay marriage, men using women¡¯s restrooms or permanently dividing the land of Israel, they deserve to be rebuked. 
Let¡¯s see if all of Donald Trump¡¯s new evangelical friends are willing to challenge him on these things. 
My guess is that they will not be. 
This is yet another sign that ¡°social conservatives¡± and evangelical Christians have fallen into great apostasy. These days people just believe whatever they want to believe, and they are doing whatever is right in their own eyes. 
On Monday, we learned that one of the most popular Christian bloggers in the entire country has come out as a lesbian. 
Doyle Melton¡¯s brand new book is an Oprah Book Club selection, and she separated from her husband not too long ago. And of course it turns out that there was a very good reason for separating from her husband. She has decided that she is no longer a heterosexual at all, and she has just announced that she is now dating female soccer star Abby Wambach ¡­ 
A Christian mommy blogger has announced she is dating retired soccer star Abby Wambach. 
Glennon Doyle Melton posted a smiling picture of herself and Wambach on Sunday, with the caption: ¡®Oh my God, she is so good to me. She loves me for all the things I¡¯ve always wanted to be loved for. She¡¯s just my favorite. My person.¡¯ 
Both are newly single. 
But of course Donald Trump is ¡°fine¡± with that, and so is much of the evangelical Christian world. 
In my new book , I warned about the great apostasy that is coming, and the election of Donald Trump is not going to change that. In fact, there is no possible way that America will ever be ¡°great again¡± until we turn from our evil ways . 
If we continue to murder millions of babies in our abortion mills, judgment will come to America. 
If two-thirds of all Christian men continue to look at pornography on a regular basis, judgment will come to America. 
If we continue to greatly celebrate things that God says are an abomination, judgment will come to America. 
If divorce rates in the church continue to be about the same as they are in the world, judgment will come to America. 
If we continue to have 20 million new cases of sexually-transmitted disease   every year, judgment will come to America. 
The name of God is blasphemed in almost all of our movies and television shows, and yet Christians still sit there and watch them every night. America is among the world leaders in adultery, drug addiction, alcoholism, registered sex offenders and teen pregnancy, and we produce more pornography than the rest of the planet combined. 
America is not great right now, and it never will be again unless we get our hearts right with God. 
And at this moment, there are very serious doubts about whether Donald Trump is going to take us in the right direction as a nation.",english,2016-11-15T07:16:09.458+02:00,endoftheamericandream.com,US,,Comment on What Donald Trump Just Did Is Going To Have Social Conservatives In A State Of Complete Shock by live in the light,0,http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Donald-Trump-Thumbs-Up-Trump-Presidential-Transition-Team-460x311.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

The election of Donald Trump has brought a giant wave of optimism to conservative America unlike anything that we have seen since probably the days of Ronald Reagan. Millions of Americans that were once deeply pessimistic about the future of this country now have hope again thanks to what many consider to be the greatest miracle in the history of U.S. politics . And just like so many of the pre-election polls, the predictions about how the nation would immediately respond to a Trump victory have turned out to be completely wrong as well. 
Instead of a historic stock market crash as many in the mainstream media were projecting, we have seen an unprecedented stock market rally in the days following Trump¡¯s win. 
Instead of an immediate economic downturn, many economic indicators have surged to their highest levels in quite some time in recent weeks. 
And instead of feeling gloomy about the future, many Americans are feeling really good about what is ahead for the first time in a very long time. 
The following are 12 signs of extreme optimism in America now that Donald Trump has been elected¡­ 
#1 The U.S. dollar is once again the strongest currency in the world. It has soared in value since Trump¡¯s stunning election victory and on Wednesday the U.S. dollar index hit the highest level that we have seen since March 2003 . 
#2 Stocks continue to skyrocket in the aftermath of Trump¡¯s win. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a brand new all-time record closing high of 19083.18 . 
#3 The University of Michigan¡¯s consumer expectations index has hit the highest level in 18 months . 
#4 The percentage of Americans that believe that the U.S. will experience ¡°continuous good times¡± over the next year has risen to 46 percent , which is up 11 percent from the reading in October. 
#5 Some other newly released numbers show that U.S. consumers are the most optimistic that they have been in a decade ¡­ 
According to the latest report , in some cases, Americans are the most hopeful they have been in more than a decade. For the first time since 2006, 37 percent of households said they expect their personal finances to improve in 2017. Also hitting decade highs: real income expectations, as wage growth continues to gain strength in a broadening swath of the economy. 
#6 Investor optimism about stock prices has risen to the highest level in 21 months . 
#7 U.S. manufacturing PMI has hit the highest level in 13 months . 
#8 The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation has hit a 10 month high . 
#9 The Federal Reserve appears to think that the U.S. economy is now ¡°strong enough¡± for a hike in interest rates in December . 
#10 Now that Trump has won, gun stores are reporting that sales are down significantly as Americans embrace a more positive outlook regarding the future. 
#11 A new Gallup poll has found that 51 percent of Americans have become ¡°more confident¡± in Trump¡¯s ability to lead the country since the election, and only 40 percent have become ¡°less confident¡±. 
#12 As I discussed just a few days ago , Gallup has also found that the percentage of Republicans that believe that the U.S. economy is ¡°getting better¡± jumped from 16 percent just prior to the election to 49 percent after the election. 
Now that Donald Trump has been elected, many Americans are convinced that the U.S. economy will become stronger than ever before. 
Now that Donald Trump has been elected, many Americans are convinced that the U.S. military will be rebuilt and will become so strong that nobody will ever dare to mess with us. 
Now that Donald Trump has been elected, many Americans are convinced that the United States will once again become the most loved and most respected nation on the entire planet. 
Now that Donald Trump has been elected, many Americans are convinced that relations with Russia, China and other major foreign powers will significantly improve. 
Now that Donald Trump has been elected, many Americans are convinced that we are on the verge of a ¡°financial harvest¡± unlike anything we have ever seen before. 
Now that Donald Trump has been elected, many Americans are convinced that honor and integrity will be restored throughout our judicial system. 
Now that Donald Trump has been elected, many Americans believe that ¡°law and order¡± will be restored to our cities. 
Now that Donald Trump has been elected, many Americans are convinced that we are entering a new golden age of peace and prosperity for the United States. 
None of those things are true. 
You may not believe me right now, and that is okay, but ultimately all of the things that I have been warning about are going to hit America. We are headed for the worst times that this nation has ever experienced, and in the end it isn¡¯t going to make a difference whether Donald Trump is in the White House or not.

By Dave Robbins 

As we approach the presidential election on November 8, 2016 I don¡¯t think the candidates could be more divided. 

One is pro-life, the other is pro-choice. One is pro-gun, while the other is anti-gun. One believes global warming is a hoax, and the other claims the science is settled. One wants to build a wall, while the other is essentially for opening the borders. One believes in a traditional marriage between one man and one woman, while the other supports same-sex marriage. And the list goes on and on. 

Each of these issues is certainly important and should be considered before making a final decision on who to vote for in November. 

However, for those who follow prophecy, this upcoming election goes beyond that. Knowing that a world government is prophesied for the near future, one area that we are following closely is the ongoing process of globalization. (moving toward a global governing system) 

It is possible that this upcoming election will set the course of the United States of America on a path toward either full involvement or total dissention from this prophesied world government. If everyone understood the prophecies concerning the future global political authority, the entire election would be determined on that issue alone. That is why we chose to devote an entire article to that subject in this magazine. 

And yes, one candidate is vehemently opposed to globalization, while the other supports it in every way. 

Since the next President of the United States will serve at least a four-year term, and quite possibly eight, we thought it would be important to let you see where each candidate stands on the important issues. 

Why? With all the prophecies converging at the same time, it is likely that the next president will be in office during some of the most significant prophetic fulfillments concerning the end time. 

Although there are more technical issues at hand (i.e. taxes, infrastructure, job creation, etc.), these do not necessarily show the character of an individual. That is why we have chosen the more defining topics which let us see the person behind the persona. In our opinion, these are the most critical. 

Therefore, instead of giving you my opinion, I will let the candidates speak for themselves¡­ Abortion 
Trump: Pro-Life 

Are you pro-life? Mr. Trump, ¡°Yes¡­It¡¯s an issue. I mean it¡¯s an issue, and it¡¯s a strong issue¡­What I am saying is this: With caveats ¨C life of the mother, incest, rape. That¡¯s where I stand. So, I¡¯m pro-life, but with the caveats. You have to have it with the caveats.¡± Pregnancy outside of those caveats? Mr. Trump stated, ¡°It depends why?¡± ¡°I¡¯m, pro-life¡­very simple, pro-life.¡± [i] 

¡°¡­friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn¡¯t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child. And I saw that. And I saw other instances. And I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life.¡± [ii] 

Clinton: Pro-Choice 

¡°Politicians have no business interfering with women¡¯s personal health decisions. I will oppose efforts to roll back women¡¯s access to reproductive health care, including Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. As president, I¡¯ll stand up for Planned Parenthood and women¡¯s access to critical health services, including safe, legal abortion,¡± [iii] 

¡°The unborn person doesn¡¯t have constitutional rights.¡± [iv] 

¡°I believe we need to protect access to safe and legal abortion, not just in principle, but in practice.¡± [v] Climate Change 
Trump: ¡°It¡¯s a Hoax¡­¡± 

On December 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., ¡°Obama¡¯s talking about all of this with the global warming and¡­a lot of it¡¯s a hoax. It¡¯s a hoax. I mean, it¡¯s a money-making industry, okay? It¡¯s a hoax, a lot of it.¡± [vi] 

In an ¡°Energy Policy¡± speech in North Dakota on May 26, 2016 Trump stated, ¡°¡­rescind all the job-destroying Obama executive actions including the Climate Action Plan¡­We¡¯re going to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.¡± [vii] 

¡°There has been a big push to develop alternative forms of energy¨Cso-called green energy¨Cfrom renewable sources. That¡¯s a big mistake. To begin with, the whole push for renewable energy is being driven by the wrong motivation, the mistaken belief that global climate change is being caused by carbon emissions. If you don¡¯t buy that¨Cand I don¡¯t¨Cthen what we have is really just an expensive way of making the tree-huggers feel good about themselves.¡± [viii] 

Clinton: The Science is Settled. 

¡°It¡¯s hard to believe that people running for president refuse to believe the settled science of climate change.¡± [ix] 

¡°I believe in science. I believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.¡± [x] 

¡°Go talk to a scientist!¡± she said. ¡°I really am tired of the debate, which is a phony debate. Climate change is real. It is here. It has to be dealt with.¡± [xi] Gun Control 
Trump: Pro-Gun 

¡°The Second Amendment to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Period¡­The Second Amendment guarantees a fundamental right that belongs to all law-abiding Americans. The Constitution doesn¡¯t create that right ¨C it ensures that the government can¡¯t take it away. Our Founding Fathers knew, and our Supreme Court has upheld, that the Second Amendment¡¯s purpose is to guarantee our right to defend ourselves and our families. This is about self-defense, plain and simple¡­It¡¯s been said that the Second Amendment is America¡¯s first freedom. That¡¯s because the Right to Keep and Bear Arms protects all our other rights. We are the only country in the world that has a Second Amendment.¡± [xii] 

Clinton: Anti-Gun 

George Stephanopoulos asked, ¡°Do you believe that an individual¡¯s right to bear arms is a constitutional right; that it¡¯s not linked to service in a militia?¡± Mrs. Clinton replied, ¡°I think that for most of our history there was a nuanced reading of the Second Amendment until the decision by the late Justice (Antonin) Scalia. And there was no argument until then that localities and states and the federal government had a right ¨C as we do with every amendment ¨C to impose reasonable regulations. So I believe we can have common-sense gun safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment¡­But I¡¯m going to continue to speak out for comprehensive background checks; closing the gun show loophole; closing the online loophole; closing the so-called Charleston loophole; reversing the bill that Sen. (Bernie) Sanders voted for and I voted against, giving immunity from liability to gun makers and sellers. I think all of that can and should be done, and it is, in my view, consistent with the Constitution.¡± [xiii] 

¡°When it comes to guns, we have just too many guns,¡± Clinton said. ¡°On the streets, in our homes, in our neighborhoods.¡± [xiv] 

¡°I am not here to make promises I can¡¯t keep. I am here to tell you I will use every single minute of every day, if I am so fortunate enough to be your president, looking for ways that we can save lives, that we can change the gun culture¡­It is just too easy for people to reach for a gun to settle their problems. It makes no sense.¡± [xv] 

¡°I was proud when my husband took [the National Rifle Association] on, and we were able to ban assault weapons, but he had to put a sunset on so, 10 years later, of course [President George W.] Bush wouldn¡¯t agree to reinstate them¡­We¡¯ve got to go after this¡­And here again, the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. And I am going to make that case every chance I get.¡± [xvi] 

¡°I don¡¯t know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work, but certainly the Australia example is worth looking at,¡± Clinton said at a New Hampshire town hall¡­The Australian program reduced the number of firearms in circulation by implementing a gun buy-back plan for citizens. [xvii] Immigration 
Trump: ¡°I will Build a Great, Great Wall¡­¡± 

¡°You cannot have¡­illegal immigration. You don¡¯t have a country if you have that¡­As has been stated continuously in the press, people are pouring across our borders unabated. Public reports routinely state great amounts of crime are being committed by illegal immigrants. This must be stopped and it must be stopped now.¡± [xviii] 

¡°I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.¡± [xix] 

Mr. Trump responded to a question on mass deportation: ¡°No, I would not call it mass deportations¡­We¡¯re going to do it (deport illegals) in a very humane fashion. Believe me. I have a bigger heart than you do. We¡¯re going to do it in a very humane fashion¡­I want terrorists out. I want people that have bad thoughts out. I would limit specific terrorist countries, and we know who those terrorist countries are.¡± [xx] 

Clinton: ¡°We will not Build a Wall.¡± 

¡°We will not build a wall. Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good paying job can get one. And we¡¯ll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy¡­I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to kick them out.¡± [xxi] 

¡°In 2003, I sponsored the DREAMER (sic) Act. I sponsored I think in every Congress after that. I have been consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.¡± [xxii] 

Mrs. Clinton made this statement concerning Syrian refugees: ¡°We¡¯re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II and I think the United States has to do more¡­I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 (incoming refugees) and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in.¡± [xxiii] 

¡°I would stop (deportations) of the undocumented (illegal) people living in our country,¡± Clinton responded. ¡°I do not want to see them deported¡­I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That¡¯s exactly what I will do.¡± [xxiv] 

¡°You can count on me to defend President Obama¡¯s executive actions on DACA and DAPA when I am president,¡± Clinton said, referring to Obama¡¯s 2012 (DACA) and 2014 (DAPA) executive amnesties, which gave work permits and access to federal benefits to millions of illegal immigrants. [xxv] Obamacare 
Trump: ¡°¡­Repeal and Replace Obamacare¡­¡± 

Speaking at the Iowa Freedom Summit in January 2015, Mr. Trump stated, ¡°Someone has to repeal and replace Obamacare¡­ (Obamacare is) a total catastrophe. It kicks in in 2016 and it will be a disaster. People are closing shops. Doctors are quitting the business. I have a friend who was a doctor and he says he has more accountants than patients. He needs that because it is complicated and terrible.¡± [xxvi] 

¡°We are going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better.¡± [xxvii] 

Clinton: ¡°I will Defend the Affordable Care Act¡­¡± 

¡°I will defend the Affordable Care Act, but as president I want to go further¡­I want to strengthen the Affordable Care Act.¡± [xxviii] 

¡°You know, before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare¡­¡±I am a staunch supporter of President Obama¡¯s principal accomplishment, namely the Affordable Care Act.¡± [xxix] 

Concerning Obamacare for illegal immigrants: ¡°There are two steps here. If someone can afford to pay for an insurance policy off the exchanges that were set up under the Affordable Care Act, I support that. If they can afford it, they should be able to go into the marketplace and buy it. However, it is not going to apply to people who are in need of subsidies in order to afford that¡­What I do want to see is that we have more options for undocumented (illegal) people to be able to get the health care they need¡­It¡¯s not only the right and moral thing to do for them. It¡¯s also important that we keep ourselves healthy, and public health requires that. So I see this as a two-step process.¡± [xxx] Warrantless Surveillance/Database 
Trump: Bulk Data Collection is Fine 

Mr. Trump said that he would be ¡°fine¡± with restoring provisions of the Patriot Act to allow for the bulk data collection. ¡°As far as I¡¯m concerned, that would be fine,¡± Trump said. [xxxi] 

Mr. Trump also told the Daily Signal , ¡°I support legislation which allows the NSA to hold the bulk metadata. For oversight, I propose that a court, which is available any time on any day, is created to issue individual rulings on when this metadata can be accessed.¡± [xxxii] 

Clinton: Does not Regret Her Vote on Patriot Act 

Concerning plans for expanded online surveillance of potential extremist attackers: ¡°We already know we need more resources for this fight. The professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out¡­That¡¯s why I¡¯ve proposed an ¡®intelligence surge¡¯ to bolster our capabilities across the board, with appropriate safeguards here at home.¡± [xxxiii] 

During the Democratic Presidential debate on October 13, 2015 Anderson Cooper asked: ¡°Governor Chafee, you and Hillary Clinton both voted for the Patriot Act which created the NSA surveillance program. You¡¯ve emphasized civil liberties, privacy during your campaign¡­Secretary Clinton, do you regret your vote on the Patriot Act?¡± 

Clinton replied, ¡°No, I don¡¯t. I think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 9/11 to put in place the security that we needed. And it is true that it did require that there be a process. What happened, however, is that the Bush administration began to chip away at that process. And I began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in. We always have to keep the balance of civil liberties, privacy and security.

Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did.
In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC¡¯s activities.
He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars.

A Hillary Clinton goon destroyed Donald Trump¡¯s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
The ¡°peaceful man¡± said that he had 4-5 family members assaulted and that hes terrible upset that he has a presidential nominee who is a ¡°poster child for sexual violence¡±. People were standing around and filming his ¡°brave act¡±, we imagine it took several minutes to accomplish this, yet no one intervened, no one called the cops.
Most of the fake accusers have already been debunked but batshit crazed liberals still push on the narrative that Trump is a rapist.
This is a classic tactic from Saul Alinsky of whom Hillary Clinton idolized and based her college thesis on. Divert attention away from your issues with the same issue but falsely accusing it on your opponent. Nice!
So Hillary wants to divert attention away from her open marriage and from her husband¡¯s rapes of multiple women with false accusations of Trump. Make no mistake about it, this is not a Trump issue. She would have done the same thing with any other opponent. If it were Ted Cruz, same story, if he would have exposed Bill Clinton¡¯s rapes, the next week you would have had multiple women falsely accusing Ted Cruz of raping and groping them. Unbelievable!
The vandal identified himself as James Otis and he removed the emblem from the middle of the star to sell it and donate the money to all the women who were raped by Trump.
You would think that in the light of Project Veritas videos and how they exposed the DNC evil who paid agitators, violence, voter fraud and more they would chill out for a while but nope, the viciousness is going on. These people are pushing the limits of law in this country and as of now its a banana republic led by banana-boy Obama but if Trump gets in, a lot of people are RIGHTFULLY going to be locked up and have the key thrown away for all this chaos, anarchy and lawlessness.
LAPD is currently searching for the vandalism suspect.
Trump received his star in 2007. In July 2016 a protester built a 6-inch wall around the star which is a legitimate form of protest, but destroying the star is just anarchy and that man needs to be locked up for a while along with the Democrats who paid him to do that.
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said they are planning to repair the star. Well at least they have some honor in them.
¡°People can make a difference by voting and not destroying public property¡± the chamber¡¯s president said.
These sort of things are normally expected to happen in poor countries with little to no freedoms where the opposition party is systematically oppressed but in a country like America which brags to the world how it is ¡°the greatest democracy in the world¡± it is surely setting a bad example which no one in its right mind would like to follow.
If it has come to the point that even the communist state press in China is saying that what the media in America is doing to Trump is pure bias, then we know how bad it is in America.
The media people in America are rubbing their hands at this one. They are truly happy and excited this happened.

Donald Trump is warning America that Hillary Clinton¡¯s insane idea to create a no-fly zone over Syria would lead to World War Three with Russia, Syria and Iran.
Setting up a no-fly zone over Syria means telling the government of Syria (as well as Russia) they¡¯re not allowed to fly planes over their own country, even though they¡¯re in the middle of a war with ISIS and other US-backed rebel terrorist groups.
It¡¯s completely psychotic, that¡¯s why even leftists like Green party candidate Jill Stein have said Hillary is ¡°much scarier¡± than Trump and could slide us ¡°into a nuclear war¡± with Russia .
As you¡¯ll see in this article, Reuters asked Hillary to defend her insane plan but she just dodged the question and instead attacked Trump as ¡°unfit to be commander-in-chief.¡±
From Reuters :
U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Democrat Hillary Clinton¡¯s plan for Syria would ¡°lead to World War Three,¡± because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear-armed Russia.
In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State is a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy.
Trump questioned how Clinton would negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin after demonizing him; blamed President Barack Obama for a downturn in U.S. relations with the Philippines under its new president, Rodrigo Duterte; bemoaned a lack of Republican unity behind his candidacy, and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders would support him.
¡°If we had party unity, we couldn¡¯t lose this election to Hillary Clinton,¡± he said.
On Syria¡¯s civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict.
Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ¡°safe zones¡± on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets.
¡°What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,¡± said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. ¡°You¡¯re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.
¡°You¡¯re not fighting Syria any more, you¡¯re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,¡± he said.
Clinton¡¯s campaign dismissed the criticism, noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts have denounced Trump as unfit to be commander-in-chief.
¡°Once again, he is parroting Putin¡¯s talking points and playing to Americans¡¯ fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria,¡± Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said in a statement.
Trump said Assad is much stronger now than he was three years ago and said getting Assad to leave power was less important than defeating Islamic State.
¡°Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,¡± he said.
A memo was leaked earlier this year showing Hillary Clinton¡¯s State Department said on December 31, 2012 that overthrowing Syria was the ¡°best way to help Israel.¡± 

The foreign policy goals in that State Department memo just so happen to align with the goals of this powerful Israeli think tank :

Seeing as how the U.S. just last month conducted an airstrike on a group of Syrian fighters to help ISIS overrun one of their positions , it¡¯s not unreasonable to question what the hell is actually going on here.
Uniting with Assad and Russia to destroy ISIS, as Trump has said he would do, is without a doubt the sane plan in Syria if one wants to pursue America¡¯s interests. Instead, Clinton and Obama are trying to both overthrow Assad by arming ¡°good¡± rebel groups and somehow also kill ISIS on the side ¨C though it just so happens the weapons they¡¯re giving to the ¡°good¡± rebels keep falling into ISIS¡¯s hands.
The result has been what we¡¯re seeing in Syria ¨C an endless, drawn out war leading to untold human misery, suffering, death and the migrant crisis.

This is what we expected all along.
The #NeverTrump independent candidate Evan McMullin is working to eliminate Donald Trump and elect Hillary Clinton.
The #NeverTrump Republican candidate last week told reporters all Republicans are racist.
The #NeverTrump movement hopes McMullin will steal enough votes from Trump for Hillary to win Utah.
McMullin told reporters this week his goal is to take down Trump.
McMullin: What wea?re trying to do is earn enough electoral votes is to block Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump¡­ If not they then we will be happy to have prevented someone who I believe is a true authoritarian from taking power in the United States and that¡¯s Donald Trump.
Now what is it will all those Democrats saying ¡°Trump is dangerous¡±? Dangerous to what? To their nest of corruption of course. Sure he is dangerous to that, they will go to jail most likely. Evan McMullin who looks like an E.T. with that ugly bold head of his used a different wording though, which is basically the same. He said he doesn¡¯t want a ¡°true authoritarian to take power in the US¡±. Umm sure he doesn¡¯t, he doesn¡¯t like the authority, the rule of law. Nope, he likes the rule of jungle where everybody can be corrupt in peace and be left alone.
According to his Wikipedia page, he is a former CIA operative who also worked at Goldman Sachs.
Those Democrats are so despicable. Its as if the USA fell in the hands of the organized Mafia.
Its obvious now this douchebag is a Hillary plant. Perhaps Republicans should have done something similar in California. Have some paid SJW agent trying to steal California away from the Democrats.

Another astonishing Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs (GUVM) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) reported this morning that former Clinton Foundation CEO Eric Braverman, who last week applied for ¡°urgent and immediate¡± political asylum at the Russian Embassy in New York City, failed to keep his scheduled interview yesterday¡ªwith speculation being made by Federation intelligence analysts that his having gone missing is ¡°directly related¡± to the mysterious and sudden death of Donald Trump¡¯s top money guru E. Lee Hennessee. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, Mr. Braverman was scheduled to return to the Russian Embassy in New York City yesterday for an in-depth interview related to the request he made last week for ¡°urgent and immediate¡± political asylum in Russia¡ªand as we had previously reported, sent shockwaves through the Kremlin as some Federation intelligence analysts believed his request was for the purpose of ¡°protection by publicity¡± due to his fears that the Clinton Crime Family wanted him killed.
Fears that he was being targeted for death by the Clinton Crime Family, specifically Hillary Clinton, this report continues, was due to Mr. Braverman¡¯s past association with the Clinton Foundation criminal money laundering organization that he headed as CEO after being installed there by Chelsea Clinton who discovered for herself the massive corruption of this supposed to be charity.
With the American press widely reporting (though skeptically) Mr. Braverman¡¯s asylum request (¡°a simple ¡°here I am¡± could quiet the waters ¨C but there has been none¡±), however, this report notes, Federation intelligence analysts contributing to this report note that not only did he fail to keep yesterday¡¯s interview date at the Russian Embassy in New York City, he has yet to publically deny his actions, and since 12 October has failed to even update his Twitter page account.
To why Mr. Braverman has gone silent and missing, this report continues, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is attributing to yet another Clinton Crime Family related mysterious death¡ªthis one being Donald Trump¡¯s longtime billionaire money guru E. Lee Hennessee, age 64, found dead this past week in her Trump Plaza home, located in West Palm Beach, Florida¡ªwith one media account suggesting it was related to a domestic harm case involving her husband and longtime business partner, and another saying she died of a stroke¡ªbut with no autopsy having yet been performed.
Donald Trump¡¯s money guru E. Lee Hennessee, this report explains, was one of the most powerful women financiers on Wall Street whose company, Hennessee Group LLC, achieved a staggering 2,132% increase of profits between 1987-2015 and was co-run by her husband Charles Gradante.
As to why Hillary Clinton feared and hated E. Lee Hennessee, this report says, is due to her having created for Donald Trump an ¡°extraordinary/unique¡± investment portfolio that, in essence, has allowed him to run his revolutionary presidential campaign entirely debt free costing him virtually nothing as for every dollar he spent, he was able to gain back two more¡ªthus making it the first US presidential election run in history to turn a profit.
With what is infamously called the Clinton Body Count rapidly increasing through this US presidential election cycle, this report concludes, there now appears to be a breaking of support of Hillary Clinton among America¡¯s elites, with even the Chicago Tribune this past week saying Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside as the American political system is breaking down and their warning that it¡¯s been crumbling for some time now, and the establishment elite know it and they¡¯re properly frightened¡ªand is most assuredly going to get worse with the shocking revelation that the FBI has now discovered a staggering 650,000 Hillary Clinton secret emails on the computer of her top aide Huma Abedin¡¯s disgraced pedophile husband Anthony Weiner.

Billionaire venture capitalist and PayPal founder, Peter Thiel spoke at the National Press Club today on his support for Donald Trump.
Most of the media ignored the groundbreaking presser today.
They don¡¯t want Americans to know about this pro-Trump gay conservative from Silicon Valley.
FOX Business Network carried much of the speech live.
Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel took his pro-Trump message to the heart of the media establishment in a major speech at the National Press Club this morning.
¡°We¡¯re voting for Trump because we judge the leadership of this country to have failed,¡± Thiel said to an audience of about 150 members of the press.
¡°The insiders have been getting it wrong for a long time,¡± he added. Establishment politicians ¡°are just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.¡±
During the Q&A session, the moderator inquired about ¡°social blowback¡± Thiel has received for supporting Trump and dwelled heavily on Thiel¡¯s funding of the Hulk Hogan case that brought down Gawker.
Thiel justified funding the lawsuit against a Gawker that he described as a ¡°singular, sociopathic bully.¡± Defending illegal revenge porn under the guise of the First Amendment ¡°is an insult to journalists,¡± he noted.
That comment aroused a scowl in the reporter sitting next to me, who walked out shortly after.
The room was full of about 150 journalists, mostly from mainstream publications. There was a row of cameras filming the event, but only two reporters appeared to be streaming it live through Periscope and Facebook Live. National Press Club Executive Director William C. McCarren treated several members of the press brusquely as they tried to enter the event.
The event highlighted the growing gulf between the establishment and the rest of the country, the mainstream press versus the independent press, and the truth of what¡¯s seen from direct sources and how mainstream reporters often spin it.
At one point during the speech, Thiel directly pointed out the hoaxing and bias within the media. ¡°The Advocate, a magazine which once praised me as a ¡®gay innovator,¡¯ published an article saying that as of now I am, and I quote, ¡®not a gay man,¡¯ because I don¡¯t agree with their politics.¡±
When a high-profile, highly intelligent figure like Thiel supports Trump, who cares about the truth?

CNN (also known as the Clinton News Network) has gone out of its way to try to rig the election for Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton this year. It hasn¡¯t even tried to hide its bias in an attempt to destroy Republican nominee Donald Trump¡¯s chances at becoming president.
Over the weekend, CNN tried desperately to find anything it could to distract the American people from the FBI¡¯s announcement that it was reopening the investigation into Clinton¡¯s use of an email server while she was secretary of state.
CNN ran a story on Sunday about a Trump rally in Colorado, only it blatantly lied about what Trump said at the rally in an attempt to smear him, Mediate reported .
The article in question originally ran with the headline ¡°Trump, skeptical of mail-in balloting, encourages voting more than once if necessary.¡± Here¡¯s a screen grab of the original.
¡°If you go to university center, they¡¯ll give you a new ballot, they¡¯ll void your old ballot, in some places they do that four or five times, so by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in,¡± Trump said at the rally, according to CNN¡¯s original article.
However there was more to that quote, which CNN decided not to run with.
¡°If you go to university center, they¡¯ll give you a new ballot, they¡¯ll void your old ballot. They¡¯ll give you a new ballot, and you can go out and make sure it get¡¯s in. Now in some places, they do that four or five times, but we don¡¯t do that. So by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in,¡± is the full quote of what Trump said.
By selectively editing the quote, CNN made it appear that Trump was encouraging voter fraud.
After publishing the original story, CNN changed the headline, and the content, to actually reflect what Trump actually said. Initially, the network did not indicate it had done so. However, a line was later added at the end of the article to indicate it had been changed.
The new headline can be seen below:

CNN also took down the tweet that had the incorrect headline.
Maybe next time CNN will think twice before publishing such blatant lies. Instead of trying to cover up Clinton¡¯s corruption, maybe the network should just to its job and report on the news.
This is what the media is doing these days, they chop speeches, edit them, falsify them! Let this be a warning to you for any future BS that may come out from the media. No matter how much they hype it. Do NOT believe anything the media tells you!
You know what you have to do, go out and vote for Trump! Avoid electronic voting because the machines are owned by George Soros, a Clinton donor, request paper ballot because they are obligated by the law and if they refuse to give you a paper ballot, make a scene, call the cops on them.

FBI officials say their investigation into links between US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Russia has been unable to uncover any so far, according to the New York Times.
The bureau has been trying to find evidence showing that the Russian government is trying to influence the US presidential campaign since the beginning of summer. FBI agents have put advisers close to GOP candidate Donald Trump under close scrutiny, searching for financial connections that some have alleged exist between the nominee and Russian financial figures. They even followed up on a lead hinting that there had been a secret email correspondence between Trumpa?s Organization and Russiaa?s Alfa-bank. All the while, the bureau has been searching for the hackers that breached the computers of the Democratic camp and leaked emails that became the source of many scandals damaging to Democratic candidate Hillary Clintona?s campaign.
Nonetheless, the FBI still cannot say that any of its investigations have uncovered direct links between Trump and Russian authorities, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing recent interviews and its own bureau sources.
a?No evidence has emerged that would link [Trump] or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russiaa?s election operations,a? writes the NYT.
Officials also anonymously told the NYT that whoever the hackers were, the attacks were aimed at disrupting the presidential race on the whole, and not boosting Trumpa?s chances of getting into the Oval Office, as the Western media and Democrats have been claiming.
In explaining why Russia would want to interfere in the campaign, one senior official was cited as saying, a?It isna?t about the electiona? Ita?s about a threat to democracy.a?
The FBIa?s inquiries will continue, however. In interviews over the past several weeks, intelligence officials have signaled that they have opened a larger probe to look into suspicions over connections between Trump aides and Moscow.
In the most recent lead, an anonymous computer scientist going by the name Tea Leaves found some 2,700 a?look-upa? messages that tied a server being used by one of Donald Trumpa?s companies to those of Russiaa?s Alfa Bank.
Still, the FBI found that there was no two-way communication, and these messages could have been marketing emails or spam. Both the Trump campaign and Alfa Bank issued statements denying that they had been in communication.

The FBI is also probing Trumpa?s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose foreign business and political dealings have come under scrutiny since reports surfaced claiming he was involved with a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, NBC reported, citing intelligence sources.
a?Russia hackinga? vs Clinton emails 
A separate report from CNBC citing a former FBI official claims that the bureaua?s director, James Comey, was privately reluctant about naming Russia as the entity responsible for meddling in the US election campaign, reportedly saying it was too close to the November 8 Election Day.
In the beginning of October, Comey allegedly concluded that a?a foreign power was trying to undermine the election,a? but arguing against putting it out before the election itself.
He also allegedly made sure that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was not mentioned in the document compiled by the US government on October 7, which officially accused Russia of a?authorizinga? the hacking of emails accounts of US officials and organizations, out of concern that the FBI would be seen as interfering with the election if it was included.
However, last Friday, with the election mere days away, Comey announced that the bureau was reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton because several hundred thousand new emails that may be related to the private server used by the Democratic nominee had allegedly been discovered.
The announcement, which left many in the government puzzled, has already resulted in official complaints and attacks from the entire US political spectrum. On Monday, some 100 former federal prosecutors and senior Department of Justice officials, including Attorney General Eric Holder, signed a letter expressing concern over Comeya?s decision to reopen the case a?on the eve of a major election,a? as a?the mere disclosure of information may impact the electiona?s outcomea? at this stage.
Clintona?s supporters have accused Comey of deliberately hiding a?explosivea? information about Trumpa?s alleged ties to Russia, demanding that he discuss them publicly, just as he did with the new batch of Clinton-related emails.
Hillary Clinton and her supporters have repeatedly criticized Trump for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Trump has retorted that he has a?nothing to doa? with Russia and doesna?t know its leader personally.
Putin on accusations of meddling: a?rubbisha? 
Russia, in turn, has denied having any links to the Trump camp on numerous occasions, while refuting accusations that it had been behind the hacking attacks on the Democrats, with Russian President Vladimir Putin calling them a?rubbisha? last week.
a?The image [that Russia supports a candidate in the US presidential election] was created by the media,a? Putin said at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi last Thursday, stressing that this had been done deliberately.
a?This is complete and utter rubbish, and it is just a method of internal political struggle, as well as a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential elections,a? he added, while explaining that Russia does not prefer any particular candidate and is ready to work with either of them. Russiaa?s president also stressed that friendly words and intentions to normalize relations between the US and Russia are always welcome, a?whoever expresses them.a?

Republican nominee Donald Trump won the US presidential vote among American citizens voting from Israel, according to an iVoteIsrael exit poll taken this week, but in an election plagued with low favorability ratings for both candidates, he had a far less impressive showing than past Republicans have in Israel.
As The Jerusalem Post exclusively reported on Wednesday, Trump received 49% of the Israeli-American vote, while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton got 44%, according to the poll conducted by get-out-to vote organization iVoteIsrael and KEEVOON Global Research.
The majority of voters in Israel viewed the candidates unfavorably, with Trump receiving a 65% unfavorable rating and 32% favorable, and Clinton seen as 64% unfavorable and 34% favorable.
In fact, 49% of voters in Israel said the main reason they chose their candidate was because of the ¡°danger of electing the other candidate.¡± More Trump voters (60%) chose this reason than Clinton voters (39%).
Despite Trump winning among Americans in Israel, more of them are registered Democrats (33%) than Republicans (27%). Of Trump¡¯s votes in Israel, 25% came from Democrats, and 10% of Clinton¡¯s votes came from Republicans.
iVoteIsrael¡¯s poll found the states evenly split between the two major-party candidates, with New York, New Jersey, California, Maryland and swingstate Florida going to Trump, and Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois and swing-state Pennsylvania choosing Clinton. The votes from Ohio, another swing state, were tied at 44%.
Trump¡¯s margin of victory was larger among men only, 59% of whom voted for the Republican, while 52% of female voters chose Clinton.

CNN asked the Democratic National Committee to prepare questions for Wolf Blitzer¡¯s interview with Donald Trump, according to emails released by Wikileaks.
In an April 25 email entitled ¡°Trump Questions for CNN,¡± the DNC¡¯s Lauren Dillon asked fellow Democrats for questions Blitzer could ask Trump.
¡°Wolf Blitzer is interviewing Trump on Tues ahead of his foreign policy address on Wed,¡± she wrote. ¡°Please send me thoughts by 10:30 AM tomorrow. Thanks!¡±
The DNC came up with a lengthy set of questions for CNN :
¨C Who helped you write the foreign policy speech you¡¯re giving tomorrow? Which advisors specifically did you talk to? What advice did they give you? Did they give you any advice that you chose not to take?
¨C CIA Director Brennan and former CIA Director Hayden have both said that our military and intelligence officers might refuse to follow some of your orders if you were president. What would you do if the military refused to listen to you? Should they be court-martialed if they refuse to follow orders?
¨C You¡¯ve said you look to Ambassador John Bolton for military advice and called him ¡°terrific,¡± but he was one of the architects of the Iraq war. How do you explain your praise for Bolton if you also claim the war was a mistake? What advice have you taken from him?
You can read the rest here , but there¡¯s a few other gems:
¨C Do you think American victims of 9/11 should be able to sue Saudi Arabia in court? What role, if any, do you think Saudi Arabia had in the 9/11 attacks?
¨C You¡¯ve said we should have bombed the ¡°right people¡± after 9/11 and have suggested that the government has evidence Saudi Arabia was involved. Do you think we should have instead bombed Saudi Arabia?
This is smoking gun, undeniable proof that CNN is in the tank for Hillary Clinton ¨C and the rest of the mainstream media is no different.
In fact, the Clinton campaign is acting as an assignment editor for the establishment media by telling reporters what to cover ¨C and what to bury from public view that would otherwise hurt Hillary.
Previous Wikileaks emails revealed that campaign staffers are directly working with mainstream ¡°journalists¡± to develop news stories favorable to the campaign ¨C before they¡¯re published!
¡°Huffington Post is doing a piece on our treasurer Jose Villareal ¡ª will likely focus at least partially on him sitting on the Walmart board,¡± said campaign communications staffer Jesse Lehrich in a 2015 email , which reads like a reporter assignment list at a major newspaper. ¡°Other outstanding stories include: [Buzzfeed correspondent] Ruby Cramer on our grassroots organizing, Anita Kumar (McClatchy) on where we have organizers and how we¡¯ve spent our money during Q2, and [Washington Post reporter] Phil Rucker on HRC talking about gun violence prevention.¡±

A gravely written Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) report circulating in the Kremlin this morning is warning the Security Council ( SC ) that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) has now placed upwards of 300,000 of its military forces on ¡°high alert¡± that this Western alliance¡¯s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg claims is due to growing tensions with Russia ¡ªbut that Federation intelligence analysts state are intended to be used, instead, for a full-scale invasion of the United States to prevent Donald Trump from assuming the presidency. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, MoD intelligence analysts became ¡°concerned/alarmed¡± over a 25 October US military joint air defense exercise in the Arabian Sea that coordinated US Navy aircraft carrier defense of US Air Force transport and refueling aircraft¡ªbut that further analysis revealed was but a precursor to a much larger planned American military ¡°event¡± scheduled for 14 December as part of the Pentagon¡¯s planning for the upcoming inauguration of their next president.
The Pentagon¡¯s planning for their 14 December ¡°event¡±, this report continues, involves the Atlantic Ocean deployment between the United States and European Union of the aircraft carriers USS George H.W. Bush , USS George Washington and USS Abraham Lincoln whose fighter aircraft will be defending the US Air Forces¡¯ Air Mobility Command¡¯s ( AMC ) staggering deployment of 200 KC-135 Stratotanker air-to-air fueling aircraft, 150 C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, 150 C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and 75 C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft¡ªall of which are ¡°planned/scheduled¡± to leave the US empty, and return fully loaded.
Raising MoD ¡°fears/concerns¡± even more about this planned Pentagon ¡°event¡±, this report notes, is all of the US military commanders involved in it being given copies of a cryptically written Executive Order signed by President Obama 3 days ago (4 November) that states ¡° global health security is a core tenet of our national strategy for countering biological threats ¡± and directs the US Defense Department and US Secretary of State to cooperate, coordinate and communicate with unnamed foreign defense ministries .
With relations between the United States and the equally globalist European Union hanging in the balance as the majority of the EU¡¯s leaders fear a Donald Trump presidency , this report continues, many in the US are openly warning that Hillary Clinton, and the leftist forces loyal to her, are preparing to stage a ¡° false flag ¡± attack to regain their hold on power¡ªincluding one of the most feared and powerful American political operatives named Roger Stone who is, likewise, openly warning it could very well happen.
As to why Hillary Clinton fears a Donald Trump presidency, MoD intelligence analysts in this report explain, is due to the massive exposure to the American public of her many crimes¡ªincluding her cover-up of child rape and sex trafficking.
Making Hillary Clinton¡¯s dire situation even worse, this report continues, was FBI Director James Comey, yesterday, basically informing her that he wasn¡¯t prepared to indict her for her email crimes¡ªbut that US government ¡°deep state¡± sources are now leaking was a ¡°ploy/gambit¡± to keep President Obama from pardoning her before Donald Trump could assume the presidency.
With Hillary Clinton having disgraced the entire journalism profession in America for decades to come, this report says, these propagandists crimes against the citizens of US continue to astound the whole world¡ªincluding the once respected television news network CNN now being proven to have colluded with Clinton to destroy Donald Trump.
But to one of the greatest crimes against the American people these Hillary Clinton propagandist journalists are responsible for, this report says, is their failing to tell them that her top aide, Huma Abedin, is, in fact, an imbedded spy bought and paid for by Saudi Arabia that the Federation has warned the US government about for decades.
But to the shockingly worse crime being committed against the American people, this report concludes, is President Obama himself now openly calling for all illegal immigrants in the United States to vote for Hillary Clinton, and pledging that the corrupt government he now controls will do nothing about it.
And though not mentioned in this MoD report, there are no greater examples of how corrupt the Obama-Clinton regime has made America then the cases of a young California single mother named Mariza Reulas who is facing years in prison for the crime of selling a single supper to a member of her ladies food club and the destruction of MIT professor Cesar Hidalgo for daring to tell to the truth about Clinton¡¯s emails¡ªboth occurring while Hillary Clinton, and all of the criminals associated with her, are still able to walk free¡ªbut if Donald Trump is allowed to survive he may be able to save, along with the United States itself.

IRAQI Christians will pray for Donald Trump¡¯s election victory after they condemned US Government for ¡°abandoning¡± them to the barbaric terror of Islamic State.
The Christian community in the latest Iraqi town to be freed from ISIS have opened up about how they were terrorised at the hands of the twisted jihadi militants.
The once-bustling Qaraqosh, which boasted of more than 50,000 Christian residents, was recaptured from the jihadis last week.
Residents who stayed in the town have described how ISIS told every Christian to pay a massive tax, convert to Islam or face execution.
Those who survived the terror have now voiced their outrage that President Obama refused to protect them when Iraq¡¯s largest Christian city fell to ISIS more than two years ago.
A man in the village said he hopes Donald Trump ¨C a widely favoured candidate in the town ¨C will bring a different approach to Iraqi Christians.
He told the camera: ¡°Obama has never helped the Christians. In fact, he despises them. In the last 26 months, he has shown he despises all of them.
¡°But we have hope in the new president, Trump.¡±

Donald Trump has previously spoken up about how Christians have been left to fend for themselves by the US government.
A Catholic priest in the town said: ¡°The US government led by President Obama could have protected us ¨C or at least helped us to protect ourselves.
¡°But unfortunately Obama abandoned us, and chose not to get involved.¡±
A young girl wearing a crucifix then added: ¡°We hope this new guy called Trump will help us more than Obama did.¡±
Last Sunday, Father Ammar took mass in a shelled-out Church of the Immaculate Conception for the first time in two years.
He said: ¡°Yes, they destroyed and burned some houses and churches, but we can rebuild them.
¡°After being away for exactly 811 days, after being attacked by the forces of evil, we have come back to worship in freedom.
¡°What counts is that we can pray here again¡±
The church, still largely in rubble from the chaotic war, is Iraq¡¯s largest and used to regularly host more than 3,000 people a week to its Sunday mass
The liberation comes as Kurdish-led forces fight to free both of ISIS¡¯ largest remaining strongholds ¨C Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria.

From the National Diversity Coalition for Trump Brunell Donald-Kyei and Bruce Levell break down Donald Trump¡¯s support for minority communities.
Donald Trump said: Look, I¡¯m not Jay-Z, I¡¯m not JayLo, I¡¯m not Trina, I¡¯m not trying to entertain you but what I am saying is look I have a contract with African-American and Latinos, I want to put $100 billion into your communities over the next 8 years and not only that, I¡¯m gonna put $20 billion into School Choice.
So basically what happened is, black people are waking up better hearing Donald Trump¡¯s messages now, you got to remember the mainstream media a lot of them, not FOX, but they been calling him a racist, a the divider and all of these things, in an attempt to walk away from the fact that Hillary Clinton nor does the president have a record of doing anything for our innercities whether be blacks or Latinos.
Brunell Donald-Kyei asked blacks and latinos to try something new this time around, she said: Vote Trump and put that $100 billion dollars, that $20 billion that Donald Trump is offering, make him prove it to you, give him 4 years, give him a chance. We need that money for our communities, we need it!
Trump basically saying: I¡¯m gonna make your communities prosperous.
Donald Trump has a great message.

Hillary Clinton has been caught in yet another dirty trick in Wikileaks latest storm of email leaks.
The Democrats were planning to frame Donald Trump as a KGB-Russian agent and Putin puppet since April 2016.
Here¡¯s what Wikileaks email ID 27381 reveals:
We don¡¯t have a ton on Simes, but the pro-Russia stuff ties in pretty well to idea that Trump is too friendly with Putin/weak on Russia
Now what do you say about that? We always knew the accusations were false but now we have the proof. The Democrats are dirty! She is a disgusting filthy witch and a Soros puppet while we¡¯re at puppets!
Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump during the 3rd debate of being a ¡°Putin puppet¡± but if Trump is a Putin puppet just for wanting to be a friend with Russia and not do war with them, then what is Hillary Clinton to George Soros when she took all those dozens of millions of dollars from him?

Liberals are such disgusting animals. No brains, no empathy, no logic, average 70 IQs, zero political knowledge but who cares? They are famous, they think they get a pass on whatever they do because of that.
They are truly the filth of the earth! Many Americans are struggling with their health plans, jobs, debt, foreclosures and everything but these privileged filthy human wastes are coming to lecture you, to tell you that you are a scumbag redneck for wanting change.
They are privileged wastes, remember that! They are not going through what you¡¯re going, they are tweeting hate from their multi-million dollar mansions while you¡¯re struggling to put food on the table.
They have ruined America. You think America¡¯s $20 Trillion debt is a joke? Who is going to pay it? Will these celebrity wastes pay your debt when the economy implodes? What happens when America will reach Zimbabwe¡¯s hyperinflation rates? You think Hillary will fix the economy? First of all she doesn¡¯t want to fix anything and second she wouldn¡¯t even know how to even if she wanted.
Open your eyes America, this is your last chance to stop your country from transforming into Brazil > Venezuela > Zimbabwe and finally North Korea. It would be a slow painful process but you have the power to put an end to it by voting for Trump today!

The lawyer who organized the event, Lisa Bloom, said Trump¡¯s accuser had received threats and was too frightened to show up.
The accuser¡¯s lead attorney, Thomas Meagher of New Jersey, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He filed a one-page notice dismissing the case Friday evening in federal court in Manhattan. No explanation was given for the action.
Bloom did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.

There was plenty of speculation ¡ª and skepticism ¡ª from social media users about the validity of the charges.

The 2016 US Presidential election has seen a coming together of hard-core Bush-era neocons and the anti-Bush liberal-left in support of the candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton.
The unofficial coalition, which looks likely to help propel the Democratic nominee to the White House (if the polls are to believed), will have surprised many, but it¡¯s not the first time self-identified progressives have ¨C wittingly or unwittingly ¨C aided the cause of the most reactionary people in western politics.
The neocons: a group of ultra-hawkish hard-right imperialists, who are quite happy for the US to illegally invade other sovereign states and drop bombs all over the world. The liberal-left: who profess their support for human rights, internationalism and progressive causes.
At first sight, these two groups don¡¯t appear to have much in common. But the truth is the liberal-left have for a long time been the accomplices of the endless war lobby.
Think back to 1999 and the US-led bombing of Yugoslavia. Never mind that the Balkan state was a multi-party democracy that operated an economy with very high levels of public/social ownership: the liberal-left cheered as bombs rained down on Belgrade, Nis and Kragujevac . Many ¡®progressives¡¯ swallowed hook, line and sinker the lurid claims of a ¡®genocide¡¯ being committed in the province of Kosovo, which were later dismissed by a UN court.
Although it was promoted as a ¡®humanitarian¡¯ venture, the bombing of Yugoslavia was in fact a hard-right project pushed by fiercely anti-socialist/anti-communist Cold War warriors.
It¡¯s worth noting the names on the Executive Committee of the ¡®Balkan Action Committee¡¯ which lobbied hard for war against Yugoslavia in 1999. They included Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld ¨C three men we would all hear a lot more from in the build-up to war with Iraq.
The liberal-left were also broadly on board for the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, an assault we were told would greatly help women¡¯s rights.
However, in 2003, there was a break between most of the liberal-left and the neocons over the invasion of Iraq. This military aggression, unlike the one against Yugoslavia, was led by a Republican president. George W. Bush, the man at the helm, was too much of a Texan ¡®redneck¡¯ for educated liberal-leftists to support.
Progressives who had no problem with backing an illegal war against Yugoslavia, found they did have a problem backing an illegal war against Iraq.
In the end, the only ¡®liberals¡¯ who supported the Iraq invasion were neo-cons masquerading as liberals, and we all saw through their disguise.
In 2011, though it was ¡®business as usual¡¯ for the neocon/liberal-left alliance as a ¡®nice¡¯ Democrat administration helped destroy Libya ¨C the country which had the highest living standards in Africa ¨C and whose ¡®tyrannical¡¯ government provided free health care, education, and electricity to all of its citizens.
Again, this was a military assault which was pushed by neocons, the same crowd who¡¯d lobbied for war against Yugoslavia and Iraq. Once again the liberal-left didn¡¯t seem to notice, or indeed to care, who was behind it.
The toppling of Muammar Gaddafi (the latest neocon-designated ¡®New Hitler¡¯ who was hell-bent on ¡®genocide¡¯), would lead to a more democratic Libya with major advances in human rights, liberal-leftists assured us. In fact, the NATO attack on Libya turned the country into a failed state and a haven for jihadists.
Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State in 2011, played a prominent role in the destruction of Libya ¨C so much so that Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, in a recent interview with John Pilger, has labelled it ¡®Hillary¡¯s war.¡¯
But Libya has been quietly forgotten during the Presidential election campaign, as indeed has the Iraq war.
Liberal-leftists who couldn¡¯t bear the sight of George W. Bush are lining up with pro-Iraq war hawks to try and get HRC elected.
Film-maker Michael Moore, who made the fiercely anti-Bush documentary, Fahrenheit 9-11, finds himself on the same side as Bush¡¯s speechwriter David Frum and Robert Kagan, co-founder of the Project for the New American Century. That would have seemed unthinkable a few years back, but it¡¯s happening today, folks.
Why are America¡¯s liberal-left doing this? It¡¯s not as if Trump or Clinton are the only options: Dr Jill Stein¡¯s policies on social justice, war and peace, and climate change are far more progressive than Clinton¡¯s. Why, instead of backing Stein, are they enabling Washington¡¯s war lobby again, just as they did in 1999 and in 2011 during the bombing of Libya? Don¡¯t they ever learn their lesson? How naive are liberals to be fooled by the sudden neo-con concern for ¡®women¡¯s rights¡¯ and the rights of immigrants and gay people?
Make no mistake, the PNAC crowd are backing Clinton, not because they are appalled at sexist/racist or politically incorrect statements made by Donald Trump, but because they believe HRC will be the candidate who is more likely to continue the policy of endless war. More specifically, in regards to Syria, they want a US President who will prioritize on toppling the secular government of President Assad ¨C not defeating ISIS. Trump¡¯s great ¡®crime¡¯ in their eyes is that he does want to prioritize on ISIS ¨C and horror of horrors ¨C to work with Russia to defeat terrorism.
As America goes to the polls today, the stakes could not be higher. Clinton¡¯s support for the imposition of a No-Fly Zone against Russian and Syrian aircraft risks starting World War Three, and the deaths of potentially hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people.
Is that what the ¡®progressives¡¯ who are lining up with the destroyers of Iraq really want?

RUSSIA 
Russia is ready and looks forward to restoring bilateral relations with the United States, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, commenting on the news of Donald Trump¡¯s victory in the US presidential election.
¡°We heard [Trump¡¯s] campaign rhetoric while still a candidate for the US presidency, which was focused on restoring the relations between Russia and the United States,¡± President Putin said, speaking at the presentation ceremony of foreign ambassadors¡¯ letters of credentials in Moscow.
¡°We understand and are aware that it will be a difficult path in the light of the degradation in which, unfortunately, the relationship between Russia and the US are at the moment,¡± he added.
Speaking about the degraded state of relations between the countries, the president once again stressed that ¡°it is not our fault that Russia-US relations are as you see them.¡±
Earlier today, in a message to Donald Trump the Russian President expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each other¡¯s views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US.
The Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some ¡°burning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,¡± RIA Novosti reported.
On top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that ¡°building a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other¡¯s positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.¡±
Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin has also expressed hope that Trump¡¯s victory in the presidential election will help pave the way for a more constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington.
¡°The current US-Russian relations cannot be called friendly. Hopefully, with the new US president a more constructive dialogue will be possible between our countries,¡± he said.
¡°The Russian Parliament will welcome and support any steps in this direction,¡± Volodin added on Wednesday.
A member of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security, Senator Aleksey Pushkov, has meanwhile noted that Hillary Clinton¡¯s stake on the conflict with Russia has eventually done her a terrible disservice.
¡°[Playing the] ¡®Russian card¡¯ and portraying Putin as a bad guy did not help Clinton. On the contrary, staking on the conflict with Moscow has only caused fear, doing her a disservice,¡± he tweeted.
According to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russia¡¯s relations with the US ¡°was not our choice,¡± however.
For things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russia¡¯s interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month.
The US will have to negotiate with Russia on finding solutions to international issues as no state is now able to act alone, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week, adding that problems in bilateral relations began to mount long before the Ukrainian crisis broke out in 2014.
FRANCE 
In France, Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has said that the election results mustn¡¯t weaken relations between Europe and the US, and assured that France remains an ally of the US, and will have to see what the new president¡¯s policies will be.
The leader of the French ¡°National front¡± party, Marine le Pen, has congratulated Trump on his win over Twitter, posting, ¡°Congratulations to the new US president Donald Trump and the free American people!¡±

The Liberal media just can¡¯t give Trump his due after his historic win yesterday. Still today at 3:30pm ¨C nearly 24 hours since voting stopped ¨C the liberal media will not show Trump¡¯s total winning results.
The New York Times which did a respectable job last night keeping with timely updates still does not show Trump wins in Michigan or Arizona. Yet they report Michigan with 100% reporting with Trump up 48% to Clinton¡¯s 47%.
Arizona is worse. They show Trump leading in Arizona by five points with 100% reporting (50% to 45%).
Trump also nearly won Minnesota and New Hampshire which he lost only by 1437 votes.
Real Clear Politics is still showing Trump with only 225 delegates to date, under reporting his 300+ delegates materially.

All other electoral maps are showing Donald Trump stuck at 279 as we speak. They will eventually update but this is going on for hours now. They are so humiliated and filled with hatred against Trump that they simply delay updating their maps.
The count is over and the only one showing the finalized updated map at this point is Wikipedia which shows 306 electors.
Just a few days ago the media was having wet dreams about a Hillary Clinton landslide. They were fantasizing about Hillary getting 352 electoral votes . What a bunch of pathetic scumbags. Cancel your subscription to them, subscribe to us instead. The EU Times, we have openly supported Donald Trump since he first announced in June 2015! When everybody else was bashing him back in the primaries over bimbo Megyn Kelly, over low-energy Jeb! we were among the few who were bashing left and right everywhere to defend our dear leader of whom we immediately fell in love with just because of his immigration program alone and then more goodies were added to the table as time went on, trade deals, NAFTA, TPP, returning of jobs, industry from China, Mexico, etc. Check our archives, read our older stories, convince yourself that we are 100% Trump authentic and Trump supporters since day 1!

CNN , Washington Post , New York Times , NBC News , Google , absolutely NO ONE has updated their maps to include Michigan and Arizona! Well at least it looks like CNN finally awarded Arizona to Trump which now stands at 290 electors but they are refusing to grant him Michigan despite finishing the count hours BEFORE Arizona. They simply can¡¯t believe that so many blue northern states went to Trump¡­
It is official, it wasn¡¯t just a victory, it was a LANDSLIDE VICTORY, the people have spoken!

Ita?s easy to glance at Tuesdaya?s popular vote a¡± which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 a¡° and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated.
While she underperformed relative to Obamaa?s 2012 totals in several Midwestern states a¡± Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin a¡± Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. Whata?s more, she far surpassed Obamaa?s 2012 vote total in Florida, the countrya?s biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it.
Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college.
The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nationa?s most critical battleground states.
Leta?s look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals arena?t yet final because not all precincts have reported.
FLORIDA a¡± 29 EVs a¡± 98 percent reporting 
Obama 2012: 4,235,270
Clinton 2016: 4,485,745
Romney 2012: 4,162,081
Trump 2016: 4,605,515
Conclusion: Trump beats Obama by some 370,000 votes and wins Florida. (Note: Clinton herself won 250,000 more votes in Florida than Obama did in 2012.)
PENNSYLVANIA a¡± 20 EVs a¡± 97 percent reporting 
Obama 2012: 2,907,448
Clinton 2016: 2,844,705
Romney 2012: 2,619,583
Trump 2016: 2,912,941
Conclusion: Trump squeezes past Obama by a margin of some 5,000 votes and wins Pennsylvania. (Note: Clinton runs about 60,000 votes behind Obama, but woulda?ve had more than enough to defeat Romney in 2012.)
OHIO a¡± 18 EVs a¡° 94 percent reporting 
Obama 2012: 2,697,260
Clinton 2016: 2,317,001
Romney 2012: 2,593,779
Trump 2016: 2,771,984
Conclusion: Trump edges Obama by roughly 75,000 votes and wins Ohio. (Note: Clintona?s worst battleground state showing was Ohio, winning 380,000 [!] fewer votes than Obama.)
Stop right there and crunch the numbers: Florida (29) + Pennsylvania (20) + Ohio (18) = 67 EVs.
Romney finished with 206 EVs. By protecting all of those, and then taking 67 from Obama, Trump would hit 273 and win the presidency.
The question: Did Trump 2016 defeat Obama 2012 in all of the states Romney won? Yes. Herea?s a look at the competitive ones:
a¡° NORTH CAROLINA (98 percent reporting): Trump 2,339,603 a? Obama 2,178,388
a¡° ARIZONA (73 percent reporting): Trump 947,284 a? Obama 930,669
a¡° GEORGIA (93 percent reporting): Trump 2,068,623 a? Obama 1,761,761
a¡° UTAH (78 percent reporting): Trump 360,634 a? Obama 229,463
A review of the Romney 2012 states confirms that Trump, in this hypothetical matchup, would have carried every single one against Obama.
It doesna?t matter that Obama would have trounced Trump by nearly 300,000 votes in Michigan; by more than 200,000 in Wisconsin; by 175,000 in Virginia; and by 160,000 in Colorado. Ita?s similarly meaningless that Obama would have narrowly defeated Trump in Iowa, Nevada, and New Hampshire. The 44th president carried all of those states in 2012, and in this hypothetical contest, he would successfully defend all of them. But it wouldna?t be enough.
The electoral college would produce a razor-thin margin: Trump 273, Obama 265.
Again, this is an apples-to-oranges exercise. Ita?s impossible to know how the Obama campaign might have targeted certain voters in a contest against Trump, or whether Trump would have the same success in the three big battleground states against a more formidable opponent. But thata?s not the point here; the point is that ita?s not entirely fair to blame Clinton for depressing Democratic turnout when she ran even with him in five of the countrya?s most competitive states and ahead of him in a sixth, Florida, the single biggest swing state a¡± and still lost the electoral college.

A grim new Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that intelligence analysts of the System of Forward-looking Military Research and Development ( SFLMRD ) have now placed the United States in the ¡° active zone ¡± of nations currently undergoing a ¡° Colour Revolution ¡± as both US and EU elites have united to topple the soon to come government of President-elect Donald Trump. [ Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, SFLMRD intelligence analysts are tasked with using ¡° modern/sophisticated ¡± technologies to ensure and protect the Federation¡¯s national security interests¡ªand of which the MoD has previously identified ¡° Colour Revolutions ¡± as being one of the gravest threats, not only to Russia, but the entire world.
During the MoD¡¯s 2014 meeting of the Moscow Conference on International Security , this report explains, Federation military commanders labeled ¡° Colour Revolutions ¡± as a new US and European approach to warfare that focuses on creating destabilizing revolutions in other nations as a means of serving their security interests at low cost and with minimal casualties .
The some of first of these Western ¡° Colour Revolutions ¡± to be unleashed on an unsuspecting world, this report continues, was in 2003 when the legitimately elected democratic government of Georgia was overthrown in what was called the ¡° Rose Revolution ¡±¡ªand that turned this once peaceful nation into a Western military puppet who, in 2008, launched an unprovoked attack against the Federation , but that was quickly and decisively defeated.
Next to be attacked by a Western ¡° Colour Revolution ¡±, this report notes, was Ukraine, in 2004, who¡¯s ¡° Orange Revolution ¡± resulted in the 2014 overthrow of that nations legitimately elected government in what the powerful American private intelligence agency Stratfor (aka The Shadow CIA ) called ¡° the most blatant coup in history ¡±¡ªand like Georgia before it, has, likewise, been used by the West as a military puppet against the Federation .
In 2005, this report continues, the West then launched a ¡° Colour Revolution ¡± against Kyrgyzstan called the ¡° Tulip Revolution ¡±¡ªbut that ultimately failed leading that nation, in 2014, to expel the US military from its territory .
Once the subversive tactics of the West in their using their ¡° Colour Revolutions ¡± against other nations was ¡° deciphered/discovered ¡±, this report says, both Iran (2009-¡° Green Revolution ¡±) and Russia (2011-¡° White (Snow) Revolution ¡±) were able to be stop them from being successful and causing great loss of life.
To exactly how the West ¡° engineered/manipulated ¡± their ¡° Colour Revolutions ¡±, this report explains, was through the use of what are called non-governmental organizations ( NGO¡¯s ) using very innocuous sounding names that the United States and European Union would secretly funnel millions-of-dollars into for the purpose of fermenting rebellion¡ªand which, in 2015, President Putin signed a law against preventing their nefarious actions in the Federation .
Heading nearly all of these Western backed and financed ¡° Colour Revolution ¡± NGO¡¯s, this report details, is the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros ¡ªwho has not only fomented rebellions across the world costing thousands of innocent lives, he was, also, recently exposed as being Hillary Clinton¡¯s puppetmaster controlling all of her actions during her failed bid to become the US president .
Unlike the Federation that has protected itself against a George Soros led, and US-EU funded, NGO ¡° Colour Revolution ¡±, this report grimly warns, the United States government has now become the most vulnerable nation in the world to this type of ¡° rebellion/warfare ¡± as he funds hundreds of organizations violently opposed to both America and that nations core moral values .
And immediately upon Donald Trump being elected as the 45 th President of the United States, this report states, these George Soros funded NGO¡¯s launched their newest ¡° Colour Revolution ¡± intended not only to destroy President Trump, but the entirety of America.
Led by the George Soros funded MoveOn.org NGO , this report continues, this new ¡° Colour Revolution ¡± striking American began with tens-of-thousands of protesters striking nearly all of the United States largest cities ¡ªand that was quickly followed with thousands of these revolutionaries calling for the assassination of President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence before they can take office .
To the main ¡° purpose/reason ¡± behind these protests, this report explains, is to initiate a ¡° brutal/violent ¡± response from US government forces seeking to suppress them and reestablish order¡ªwhich in turn these revolutionaries will use as an example of how the American government is no longer legitimate because it¡¯s killing innocent people, and, therefore, must be overthrown.
Not being understood by the American people about how these ¡° Colour Revolutions ¡± work, this report continues, is that they are intended to last for years¡ªlike in Ukraine that took a full 10 years before that government was overthrown.
To the most basic reason why this ¡° Colour Revolution ¡± is now targeting the United States, this report details, are the US-EU elites fear of President-elect Donald Trump whose choice of nationalism over globalism has left European leftist leaders in ¡° complete horror ¡± as the populace revolution he, Trump, is leading is soon to wash ashore in Europe as new elections for nearly all of the continent are nearing¡ªwith Holland being the first fall , and France soon to follow , and whose next leader, Marine Le Pen , just proclaimed: ¡° Congratulations to the new President of the US, Donald Trump, and the American people ¨C free! ¡±
With the US propaganda mainstream media still in denial of what has happened to them because of President-elect Donald Trump¡¯s victory, and Google now reporting that their top search term is ¡° How did Donald Trump win? ¡± , this report further states, it bears notice that the Kremlin and its intelligence analysts were among the only entities in the world who correctly stated Donald Trump would win¡ªand as we had detailed in numerous reports, including Russia Confirms Supercomputer Findings Showing Donald Trump Landslide Victory and Russian Report Warns: American Revolution Has Now Begun, May Last Entire Decade .
But to the most global consequential outcome of Donald Trump becoming the 45 th President of the United States, this report concludes, (and as we had previously alerted you to on 13 May in our report Putin Warns Military Commanders: ¡°If It¡¯s Hillary Clinton, It¡¯s War¡± ) was President Putin¡¯s advisor Sergei Glaziev stating just hours ago how close to catastrophe our world actually was: ¡° Americans had two choices: World War III or multilateral peace. Clinton was a symbol of war, and Trump has a chance to change this course .¡±
Let¡¯s all hope President Trump can, indeed, change this course because the world, literally, now hangs in the balance if he doesn¡¯t.

¡°First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win!¡± Mahatma Gandhi, India¡¯s legendary activist. It is now time for a NEW New World Order! A patriotic and conservative world order because we had enough of what we already experienced for years!
One of the most confounding aspects of Donald Trump¡¯s election as 45th President of the United States is that in the space of a year ¨C indeed less than a year ¨C a man with zero political experience has destroyed two of the most entrenched political dynasties: Bush and Clinton.
Just pause on this for a moment, and place it in the context of someone who in response to his appearance on the political stage as a candidate for the Republican nomination was met with ridicule and scorn. Consequently, a mainstream media and liberal commentators for whom politics is an exclusive club, the preserve of a select group of blessed people who belong to the club as if by divine right, have just been delivered one almighty slap-down The sense of entitlement that emanated from the Clinton campaign during this election was astonishing to behold. Hillary Clinton emitted the demeanour of a woman approaching a coronation rather than an election, disdaining not only on Donald Trump but also his supporters, whom she infamously described as ¡°deplorables¡±. This was her undoing.
One of the most salient consequences of the 2008 global economic crash, which ushered in the worst crisis within capitalism since the 1930s, has been the collapse of the political center ground and with it the dominance of the liberal order.
In this respect, it is just as Karl Marx opined in his Communist Manifesto:
¡°All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of lifea?¡±
The analogy that best describes this process is a battlefield after the smoke has cleared to reveal the ideological right on one side and its left wing counterpart on the other, ready to go to war over the right to shape the future. And as Brexit in the UK and now Trump¡¯s electoral victory in the US leaves no doubt, this is a struggle currently being won by the right.
This is not to suggest the struggle is completely over however. On the contrary, the political, social, economic and constitutional crisis ushered in by Brexit proves that there remains some distance to travel before the matter is settled in Britain, while Trump¡¯s election will inevitably give rise to strong opposition in the streets, perhaps even sparking a much needed revival of the left across the US, which based on the success of the Sanders campaign is far from dead.
Focusing in on Donald Trump and based on statements he made in the course of his campaign, it is interesting to observe that among the many places where you will find the most grievously disappointed people in response to his victory, are NATO headquarters in Brussels and Daesh (also known as ISIL/ISIS) and Nusra headquarters in Syria. It is evidence of the hitherto insurmountable contradiction that has lain at the heart of Washington¡¯s geopolitical priorities and strategy these past few years. Trump, in contrast, laid it out very simply when he said, ¡°Russia is killing ISIS. Assad is killing ISIS. I think it would be a good idea to get along with Russia.¡±
This being said, the acid test is what he does rather than what he has said, which is why it remains far too soon to be complacent in welcoming a new dawn in Washington¡¯s relations with Russia or the rest of the world. Trump also said some harsh things about China and Iran during his election campaign, which taken in conjunction with the fact that as president he immediately becomes the CEO of an empire that is no longer sustainable, requires us to exercise caution rather than celebration at this stage.

Shocking video out of Chicago shows a mob of young black men viciously beating an older white man because he voted for Donald Trump, dragging him through the streets as he hangs out of the back of his car.
The clip shows the thugs repeatedly screaming, ¡°you voted Donald Trump¡± as they assault the victim from every angle while others steal his belongings.
¡°You voted Trump,¡± the mob screams, ¡°You gonna pay for that sh*t.¡±
Another woman shouts ¡°beat his ass,¡± while another man is heard laughing before remarking, ¡°Don¡¯t vote Trump.¡±
A second video of the incident which is dubbed with the ¡°F**k Donald Trump¡± song, a phrase now being chanted by ¡°protesters¡± across the country, shows one of the attackers driving away in the man¡¯s vehicle while his hand is still stuck in the window as the car drags him down the street.
¡°The scene is frankly reminiscent of a lynching,¡± remarks Chris Menahan .
It is not even clear if the victim was a Trump supporter. Presumably, the mob used that as an excuse to beat and rob him.
YouTube quickly deleted the video, but it has been mirrored on numerous different websites.
If the roles had been reversed, and Trump supporters had been caught on tape viciously beating a black Hillary voter, this would be a national news story right now.
This is simply unacceptable 
As it is, you won¡¯t see this on CNN any time soon. Perhaps blacks should also be deported to Africa¡­ they never seem to be satisfied, no one ever seems to make them happy. They even rioted and protested during Obama, with one of their own as president. Black Lives Matter was formed during Obama.
Besides maybe us whites are bad with them and misbehave with them, sometimes willingly and purposefully while other times by mistake. So it would be best if we separate so that we don¡¯t have these ancient conflicts anymore. This man who was beaten so badly never did anything wrong to these people, neither willingly nor unwillingly but these conflicts still happen because we are not compatible with each other.
After all first Republican president Abraham Lincoln believed in separation , he freed them from slavery but he also said:
I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black races ¨C that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything.
Now we do disagree with Lincoln¡¯s idea of superior-inferior relationship. It would however be best to separate though. It just doesn¡¯t work. Despite having almost 2 centuries now since the Emancipation Proclamation, conflicts still run rampant and no real friendship has ever been established. They should be resettled perhaps to Liberia, a plan supported by Abraham Lincoln and be helped financially with billions or even trillions of dollars until they can start their own economy and industry. They do deserve that. Anyone intermarried with them should be free to either stay in the US and divorce or simply go along with their families.

As an advice, avoid provoking these wild beasts unless you want to get beaten down badly, hospitalized or even killed, if they ask you who you voted for, lie to them, tell them Hillary Clinton, Gary Johnson or Jill Stein. We have seen countless aggravated assaults and even down-right murders in the last days against patriotic Americans who voted for Donald Trump. Do NOT engage these wild beasts no matter how much sorrow you may feel in your heart when you see different kind of scenes, such as burning of the US flag, torching stores, cars, chanting hate, etc. Let them go wild and do what they do until January 20th. After that, the law will crack down on them like you never seen before.
The American people have swallowed enough, soon retribution will come and millions upon millions will finally get deported and arrested. These people need to be punished. California in particular is worst. The millions of Mexicans who invaded California are now calling for ¡°Calexit¡±. Sure after illegally invading that state, they now call for it to secede so they can later unite it with Mexico. These people must think the Americans are stupid. Getting their hands on Silicon Valley and Hollywood for free? IT¡¯S NOT GONNA HAPPEN MEXICANS! According to Wikipedia, there are only 38% whites living in California as of 2015 after decades of ongoing invasion. Due to the that the state is permanently locked as a blue Democrat state. Republicans can sit on their tongues and eat their own eyeballs and that state will never go red in the current condition it is. This makes the road for Republicans extremely difficult since California holds the larges number of electors, 55. Non-Hispanic whites decreased from about 76.3 ¨C 78% of the state¡¯s population in 1970 to 38.0% in 2015 making them a minority in their own country. Its not like they committed suicide, they are still there but the number of migrants surpassed them, making them a minority now.
According to a census from 2010 when California had 37.2 million population in total (in 2015 it had 39.1 million) only 15.7 are white and 2.6 mil black. The rest is South American, mostly illegals. Those who are legal, are illegally legal if you understand what we mean. They¡¯ve got their citizenship through Obama¡¯s amnesties. These people will always vote Democrat, riot and demand free stuff. They need to be deported immediately or America will lose California forever which would be a shame! America must not allow Calexist. Imagine losing Hollywood and Silicon Valley! You can¡¯t just immigrate to a foreign nation, then demand secession, then later demand unification with your country of origin.
You think this is a joke? Have a look! The media is telling you however that ¡°Americans are calling to secession¡±. No! These are South American invaders, mostly Mexicans! They need to get deported, all of them! Both LEGAL and ILLEGAL because most ¡°legals¡± obtained their citizenship illegally.

We know for a fact that most of these riots are planned and paid for by globalist billionaire George Soros. He too needs to be arrested along with his entire family and have his entire fortune seized and nationalized into the US federal budget. America could use his money, after all its dead broke! The bastard is already old, 83 years old to be exact and he may not live for much longer but still he should face justice for all the riots, calls to assassinations and violence he is provoking.
See these buses? They brought thousands of protesters to Austin, Texas! Yes, the riots are ORGANIZED, PAID, SPONSORED, etc. George Soros and his entire family needs to be locked up.



They are even running ads on Craigslist searching for more rioters:

Whites who are doing this are suffering from what is known as the Stockholm Syndrome . They do not even realize what they are doing.
These people look like they are straight from Noah¡¯s times, when God flooded the Earth because he had enough:


Man attacked for voting for Trump¡­








Cher! Didn¡¯t this harlot said that she will leave America if Trump is elected? Now she¡¯s pushing for riots and violence?






Look at this sorry retard! She got more votes? So what? He got more electors! Besides she got millions of ILLEGAL votes from illegal border crossers which shouldn¡¯t even be allowed to vote.

Confront whiteness? What if someone would say confronting blackness? Hmm? What about confronting Jewishness? Ahh yeah: dats rayyysist!
And we thought Jews were our friends¡­ perhaps we were wrong!
Look at how this moronic liberal mother is installing fear into this poor child! I bet she told her something similar to this: ¡°There¡¯s a big fat blonde boogieman living in the tower of Sauron, and we here are the warriors of God, we have been sent by Jesus himself to purify America, we need to kill him because he wants to kill us all.¡± Where¡¯s CPS when you need them?


Look at the guts these Mexicans have! Instead of laying low and pretending like they are not even there, look at what they are doing. It¡¯s like basically: look at how disgusting, disturbing and violent I am, don¡¯t you wanna deport me?






To the woman in the left, yes Trump is NOT your president. Pena Nieto is, go back to Mexico.
If you¡¯re Chinese and refuse to acknowledge Trump as your president then go back to your Communist president Xi Kingpin.


Perhaps these Socialists should move to Venezuela or North Korea.



Sure they do! In Mexico! :)
No granny, he¡¯s not YOUR president, but who cares? Hillary wouldn¡¯t have been other people¡¯s president. Trump won despite having your evil which stealing millions of votes. Don¡¯t like it? Pack your bags and get out! It¡¯s time to clean America! Venezuela and Cuba would suit your better, they have multicultural socialist hellholes. Just the way you like it!
The electoral college is part of the Constitution but who cares? Viva la Che Guevara Chaos and communism, hammer and sickle!

Muh feelings! What a disturbing feminazi character¡­ who would date this creature?
Indeed, he¡¯s not your president, Pena Nieto is, go embrace him!
Watch what this woman did to her own child:

Scott Adams is creator of the Dilbert comic strip. According to his self-description, Adams is also a hypnotist of many years, trained in observing people and subtle nuances in appearance and body language. 
Below is Adams¡¯ post of September 11, 2016, ¡° Checking My Predictions About Clinton¡¯s Health ,¡± which was republished by Russia Insider : 
In a blog post I wrote on December 27th , 2015, I said this¡­ 
Bonus Thought 1: One of the skills a hypnotist has to master is reading people¡¯s inner thoughts based on their body language. That¡¯s a common skill for people in the business world too, but hypnotists go deeper than looking at crossed arms and furrowed brows. We learn to look for subtle changes in breathing patterns, tiny changes in muscle tone, variations in skin color (blushing or not), word choice, pupil dilation, and more. I assume law enforcement people look for similar tells when doing interrogations. 
As regular readers know, I¡¯m a trained hypnotist. And to me, Hillary Clinton looks as if she is hiding a major health issue. If you read Malcolm Gladwell¡¯s book, Blink , you know that so-called ¡°experts¡± can sometimes instantly make decisions before they know why . In my case, I am going to make an ¡°expert¡± hypnotist prediction about Hillary Clinton without knowing exactly which clues I am picking up, or whether I am hallucinating them. 
Prediction: I¡¯ll put the odds at 75% that we learn of an important Clinton health issue before the general election. That estimate is based on my own track record of guessing things about people without the benefit of knowing why . I think Trump is picking up the same vibe. He has already questioned Clinton¡¯s ¡°stamina.¡± 
On December 29th, 2015 I blogged that Trump would be seen as ¡°running unopposed¡± before election day. I mentioned Clinton¡¯s health as a possible reason. 
While I¡¯m on the topic, I¡¯ll add another prediction to the Master Persuader series. I predict that by the time Trump is in the general election and running against Clinton, you will start hearing that Trump ( Lucky Hitler) is ¨C for all practical purposes ¨C ¡°running unopposed¡± as Clinton¡¯s poll numbers plummet. 
That can happen in a variety of ways. One way is if Clinton¡¯s health or legal issues rise to the point of being disqualifying, and Trump persuades us to think about those things more than we think about anything else. Once you imagine there is one candidate in the race who is eligible and one who might not survive the term, or might be in jail, you start to imagine it as a one-person race. 
And you will. That¡¯s how you get a landslide. 
Look for the words ¡°running unopposed¡± in pundit articles and quotes within a few months of election day. And it still counts if it started here, because it won¡¯t catch on unless it actually fits. 
On April 29th of 2016 I expanded on the thought in this post . 
I have blogged and tweeted that Hillary Clinton looks unhealthy to me. And I have mentioned on Twitter that one of the skills of a hypnotist is identifying subtle bodily changes. Observation is a huge part of a hypnotist¡¯s skill. You look for micro changes in muscle tone, breathing, posture, and anything else that can tell you whether your technique is working or you need to quickly pivot to a new approach. Think of it as rapid A-B testing on humans. And like any skill, one gets better with practice. I have more than three decades of practice for this specific skill. 
What I see in Clinton¡¯s health is an unusual level of variability. Sometimes her eyes bug out, sometimes they are tired and baggy. Sometimes she looks puffy, sometimes not. It would be easy to assume fatigue is the important variable. And that is clearly a big factor. But notice that the other candidates have little variability in their physicality. Trump always looks like Trump. Cruz always looks like Cruz, and so on. Sometimes we think we can detect fatigue in their answers, but visually the other candidates appear about the same every day. 
Clinton, on the other hand, looks   That suggests some greater variability in her health. And that¡¯s probably a tell for medications that are waxing and waning but rarely at the ideal levels. Or perhaps the underlying conditions have normal variability. Or both. 
Under normal circumstances it would be deeply irresponsible for a cartoonist to give a medical diagnosis to a stranger he hasn¡¯t met. I trust you to ignore my medical opinions. I do this to build a record of my persuasion-related predictions and to show you the method. 
I give Clinton a 50% chance of making it to November with sufficiently good health to be considered a viable president. Judging from her performance on the campaign trail, she is managing her health effectively to get the job done. But I would think most people who run for president end up sacrificing their health in some measure. The big question is how much buffer she has left. 
To be clear, there is no dependable evidence of Clinton having an undisclosed major health issue. But it looks that way to observers.

It¡¯s a topsy-turvy world when law-breakers ¡ª those who illegally enter and stay in the United States ¡ª are sacred cows, while those who criticize the law-breakers are ostracized and demonized. 
On June 16, 2015, when Donald Trump announced that he¡¯s entering the crowded race to become the 2016 Republican presidential nominee, he made some remarks about illegal immigration which brought the wrath of the PC Left on his head. Trump said: 
¡°When Mexico sends its people, they¡¯re not sending their best. They¡¯re sending people that have lots of problems. They¡¯re bringing drugs. They¡¯re bringing crime. They¡¯re rapists. I will build a great wall ¨C and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me ¨C and I¡¯ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.¡± 
For saying that, one business after another severed their ties with Trump. Univision and Comcast¡¯s NBCUniversal cancelled plans to broadcast Trump¡¯s Miss Universe beauty pageant. Mattress giant Serta said it will stop selling Trump-branded products. Department store giant Macy¡¯s also cut its ties with Trump. 
Such righteous indignation! You would think Trump were a heinous mass murderer or a child-molester or serial rapist or bestialist! 
But Macy¡¯s anti-Trump move has backfired. 
TMZ reports, July 13, 2015: 
Macy¡¯s is paying the price for sacking Donald Trump, because we¡¯ve learned thousands of customers are cutting up their Macy¡¯s credit card in protest. 
Sources connected to the department store tell TMZ, Macy¡¯s has received complaints from approximately 30,000 customers since ending its relationship with Trump nearly 2 weeks ago. 
We¡¯re told the store has been ¡°inundated with complaints¡± from customers who believe the department store is unfairly punishing Trump for his views on immigration. 
Our sources say thousands of customers have vowed never to shop at Macy¡¯s again and many of them say they¡¯re cutting up their Macy¡¯s credit card to make a statement. 
We¡¯re told the complaints have come in various ways, including phone, Facebook and email.

Liberals are such tolerant folk. 
My car was keyed three times when I had an anti-Obama bumper sticker on it. My car was never keyed before I had that sticker and never again after I removed it. What a coincidence¡­ 
From CNN : Los Angeles police are looking for the man who destroyed Donald Trump¡¯s Hollywood Walk of Fame star with a sledgehammer and a pick ax. Police tweeted Wednesday that they¡¯re seeking the public¡¯s help in identifying the vandalism suspect. 
The man identified himself as James Otis, an heir to the Otis family¡¯s elevator fortune , in an interview with CNN on the Walk of Fame Wednesday morning. He said he was doing it to help the 11 women who have accused Trump of sexually assaulting them, and other victims who he said could come forward in the future. 
¡°I had four or five family members sexually assaulted, and I¡¯m terribly upset that we have a presidential nominee who¡¯s become sort of a poster child of sexual violence,¡± Otis said. 
CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment and not yet gotten a response. 
Otis managed to remove the gold emblem from the middle of the star and damage the star itself and the area around it. The shape of the star was still recognizable after Otis had vandalized it. 
Leron Gubler, President/CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said work to repair the star will happen immediately but the star is expected to remain covered for several days. 
Gubler said the Chamber is working with the police and intends to prosecute to the full extent of the law. ¡° When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark,¡± Gubler said. 
Otis said he plans to sell parts of Trump¡¯s star and donate the proceeds ¡°to the women who have been sexually assaulted by Mr. Trump.¡± 
¡°I know I can sell it. I think I can get over $1 million for this star, to be distributed to these women and many others that will be going forward,¡± he said. 
Otis noted he previously auctioned off personal items belonging to Mahatma Gandhi, saying he ¡°donated all the money to countries that were fighting dictatorships with non-violent strategies.¡± That 2009 auction of Ghandi¡¯s possessions attracted news coverage at the time, including by CNN , and Gandhi¡¯s items were sold for $1.8 million. 
Otis said he knows he might be arrested ¡ª though he doesn¡¯t want that to happen.

If we go by most of the MSM/corporate polls, Hillary Clinton will win on November 8. 
But there are dissenting voices. Among them is Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams , who¡¯s still predicting a 98% chance of not just a Trump win, but a landslide. Interestingly, the dissenters also include a flaming leftist ¡ª docu-maker Michael Moore. 
Moore is loathsome, but I don¡¯t think anyone has captured or articulated the reasons why so many Americans resonate to Trump¡¯s anti-globalism as well as Moore. 
Below is an excerpt from a recent speech Moore delivered, followed by my transcription: 
¡°I know a lot of people in Michigan that are planning to vote for Trump¡­. They don¡¯t necessarily like him that much and they don¡¯t necessarily agree with him. They¡¯re not racists and rednecks certainly; they¡¯re actually pretty decent people. And so I wanted to, after talking to a number of them, I wanted to write this. 
Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said, ¡®If you close these factories you¡¯re planning to do in Detroit and build them in Mexico, [when I¡¯m President] I¡¯m going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobody¡¯s gonna buy them.¡¯ 
It was an amazing thing to see. No politician, Republican or Democrat, had ever said anything like that to these executives, and it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, the Brexit states. You live here in Ohio, you know what I¡¯m talking about. 
Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because he¡¯s saying the things to people who are hurting. That¡¯s why every beaten-down, nameless, forgotten working stiff ¡ª what used to be part of what was called the middle class ¡ª loves Trump. He is the human Molotov cocktail that they¡¯ve been waiting for, the human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them. And on November 8th, Election Day, although they lost their jobs, although they¡¯ve been foreclosed on by the bank, next came the divorce, and now the wife and kids are gone, the car¡¯s been repo¡¯ed, they haven¡¯t had a real vacation in years, they¡¯re stuck with the shitty Obamacare plan when you can¡¯t even get a fucking [inaudible]. They¡¯ve essentially lost everything they had, except one thing. The one thing that doesn¡¯t cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution ¡ª the right to vote. 
They might be penniless, they might be homeless, they might be fucked over and fucked up. It doesn¡¯t matter because it¡¯s equalized on that day. A millionaire has the same number of votes as the person without a job ¡ª one. And there¡¯s more of the former middle class than there are in the millionaire class. 
So on November 8th, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain and take that lever or felt pen or touchscreen and put a big fucking X in the box by the name of the man who is threatening to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump. 
They see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump. Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The media hates Trump, after they loved him and created him and now hate him. Thank you, media. 
The enemy of my enemy is who I¡¯m voting for on November 8. Yes, on November 8, you, Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Billy Blow, Billy Bob Blow ¡ª all the Blows get to blow up the whole goddamn system because it¡¯s your right. Trump¡¯s election is going to be the biggest fuck-you ever recorded in human history, and it will feel good.¡± 
Perversely, after articulately so beautifully the profound alienation of so many Americans and why Trump speaks for them, Michael Moore then proceeded to make a whole-hog defense and endorsement of Hillary Clinton. 
Here¡¯s a screenshot from a video showing ¡°Jabba the Hut¡± Michael Moore making the speech you heard and read above. 
What if Trump loses? 
Below are excerpts from a powerful essay, ¡° The Elite ¡®Have No Idea¡¯¡ª Society is Near the Breaking Point ,¡± written by a guy who calls himself Chindit13 for ZeroHedge : 
¡°What I find most surprising today is that the insiders and the elite have no idea what is percolating just beneath the surface . Okay, maybe their arrogance actually produces its own fog, so it should not come as a surprise that they are blinded. They do not look at the calendar, which, if one really looks, says ¡®1788¡¯ on it. Something is close. Very close. Society is near the breaking point. 
My own experience is that Hillary¡¯s so-called Deplorables are actually the most reserved, most polite, and most honest demographic in the country . They are more informed, more self-reliant, and among other things, better armed. Regarding their arms, they are incredibly responsible, and not the source of the violence for which the implement, and not the person, is too often blamed. The Deplorables have the longest fuse. It is, however, a fuse. [¡­] 
The Deplorables, however, are not possessed of infinite patience. Like a capacitor, there is a charge building, and at some point it will be released into the circuitry of society. 
The media and other insiders believe themselves to be immune. That thought no doubt results from being immersed inside a cocoon where dissonant voices are not allowed. When the levee breaks, or the capacitor releases its charge, they are going to be gob smacked. 
Precious few of them are anywhere near as immune as they believe themselves to be. Additionally, what they might think, or hope, is their support, their security, their safe space, doesn¡¯t really exist. 
Most of society¡¯s guardians, whether they are law enforcement or military, are card-carrying members of the Deplorables. 
France was similarly constructed in the late 1780s. The elite were isolated only in thought, not in reality. Their protection was of a Potemkin Village nature: not actually there, but merely a facade that gave them false comfort. 
They paid dearly for their arrogance and ignorance. 
History may not repeat, but it does rhyme. The calendar really does seem to say 1788, so 1789¡ªand 1792¨Care not as far off as some would like to believe. 
This is not a call to arms, but it is a call to reality. Ignore it at your own peril. 
Some may see these words as a threat. They are not. They are, however, a warning, and a warning from someone who is a student of history. 
Every society eventually reaches a breaking point. Ours is nearly there. Some of those who might feel threatened, the so-called elite and insiders, think that they can buy protection as easily as they can buy a Gulfstream. How na?ve! Who are the private security contractors? Who are the various SOGs? Like law enforcement and the rest of the military, they are the Deplorables. The Deplorables will take your money, but you will not take their lives. Better said, they won¡¯t give up their lives for you or your family. The security you believe you have purchased is an illusion. Make that delusion. Best to get that out front here and now. 
Some might think this is all Trump¡¯s fault. Again, that shows a degree of ignorance and na?vet¨¦ which characterizes the elite. Trump is a symptom, not a cause. He might even be a salve, as the changes he could bring might defuse some of the current anger. 
On the other hand, Hillary is a lit match in a room of dynamite. She, like many of the self-important, thinks her very existence is a favor to the rest of us. She epitomizes the absolute worst of what America has become. Above the law, wealthy not through accomplishment, but through influence peddling only, and a bull in a china shop in terms of her effect on both the country and the world¡ªand I apologize to bulls for that analogy. The world is more unstable because of her. 
America is less safe because of her. Russia and the US¡ªthe two largest nuclear powers¡ªare more at odds because of her. With her in power, we will reach the breaking point at home and internationally, perhaps leading to ¡®accidental¡¯ nuclear war, as the heightened rhetoric impacts clear thinking. Society is more stratified because of her. Race relations have deteriorated because of her (and Obama). 
There are few current ills in society and in geopolitics that cannot be laid at her feet, at least to some extent. The Great Deceiver to many, who exhibits an astonishing aversion to truth telling, is enough to make even an agnostic wonder if the anti-Christ hasn¡¯t finally arrived for its three and a half years of rule. 
A recently hacked email of John Podesta finds him saying ¡®she (Hillary) has begun to hate everyday Americans¡¯. No doubt the same feelings were voiced by [Romania dictator] Nicolas Ceaucescu. It turned out the feeling was mutual. [¡­] 
Elect Hillary, and continue with business as usual, and it is likely this warning will become an epitaph for the America we know. Society may collapse regardless, because the rot is already very great, but she will hasten the day of reckoning. [¡­]¡±

John Allen? 
Nauseating. 
You should know that in 2011, Allen, then a 4-star general in the U.S. Marine Corps, was nominated to be NATO¡¯s Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, pending confirmation by the Senate. On November 13, 2012, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta suspended Allen¡¯s confirmation hearing, pending investigations into the general¡¯s ¡°inappropriate communication¡± with a woman named Jill Kelley. Gen. John Allen (l); Jill Kelley (r) 
As part of the fallout of the Gen. David Petraeus-Paula Broadwell affair, the FBI uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of correspondence ¡ª mostly email ¡ª between Allen and Kelley from 2010 to 2012. Reportedly, their correspondence was ¡°flirtatious¡± and ¡°inappropriate¡± as Allen and Kelley were both married at the time, but not to each other. 
Seriously, how can a 4-star general even have so much free time as to write 20,000 to 30,000 emails in the space of two years to ANYONE? 20,000 emails mean an average of 28 emails a day exchanged between Allen and Kelley; 30,000 emails mean an average of 42 emails a day. There is no one with whom I¡¯ve exchanged 28 emails a day, even less 42 emails. 
The upshot: Not only did John Allen lose his confirmation as NATO¡¯s Supreme Allied Commander, he also lost his job as Commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan ¡ª a post to which he was promoted to replace the disgraced Gen. Petraeus. (See ¡° Obama purges U.S. military command (Part 1) ¡±) 
Allen retired from the military in February 2013, but was appointed Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL (or ISIS) ¡ª a post and title created for Allen by Obama, which Allen held for about a year from September 2014 until October 23, 2015. 
Allen was a featured speaker at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. He criticized Donald Trump and endorsed Hillary Clinton ¡ª who abandoned four Americans to die in Benghazi ¡ª for President. 
Like the New Yorker that he is, Trump fired back, calling Allen ¡°a failed general.¡± 
Trump does have the endorsement of 184 non-failed and non-disgraced U.S. generals and admirals, including at least four 4-star and fourteen 3-star flag officers, as well as the endorsement of 14 Medal of Honor recipients. 
The endorsements began with an open letter on Sept. 6, 2016, from 88 retired U.S. general and admirals : ¡°The 2016 election affords the American people an urgently needed opportunity to make a long-overdue course correction in our national security posture and policy. As retired senior leaders of America¡¯s military, we believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world. For this reason, we support Donald Trump¡¯s candidacy to be our next Commander-in-Chief. For the past eight years, America¡¯s armed forces have been subjected to a series of ill-considered and debilitating budget cuts, policy choices and combat operations that have left the superb men and women in uniform less capable of performing their vital missions in the future than we require them to be. Simultaneously, enemies of this country have been emboldened, sensing weakness and irresolution in Washington and opportunities for aggression at our expense and that of other freedom-loving nations. In our professional judgment, the combined effect is potentially extremely perilous. That is especially the case if our government persists in the practices that have brought us to this present pass. For this reason, we support Donald Trump and his commitment to rebuild our military, to secure our borders, to defeat our Islamic supremacist adversaries and restore law and order domestically. We urge our fellow Americans to do the same.¡± 
Two days later on Sept. 8, another 21 retired U.S. generals and admirals joined the list, followed by 31 more the next day, on Sept. 9, and another 44 on Sept. 16, bringing the total number of flag officers who have endorsed Trump to 184. 
Below is the list, as of Sept. 16, 2016, of the retired U.S. generals and admirals, who are endorsing Trump for President and Commander-In-Chief: General Burwell B.

Michael Flynn is more than a valued adviser to the presumptive GOP nominee. He¡¯s also a potential VP candidate. 
The growing chatter about his key role in the Trump campaign coincides with his new book, ¡°The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies,¡± scheduled for release July 12. A vice presidential trial balloon certainly would drive interest in the text, and possibly juice sales. 
He teamed up on the book with Michael Ledeen, a prominent member of a group of scholars and former government officials that helped shape the views of many top national security leaders in the George W. Bush administration. 
Follow us: @politico on Twitter | Politico on Facebook 
Michael Ledeen 
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 
Work in the United States[edit] 
In the early 1980s, Ledeen appeared before the newly established Senate Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism, alongside former CIA director William Colby, author Claire Sterlingand former Newsweek editor Arnaud de Borchgrave. Both Ledeen and de Borchgrave worked for the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University at the time.[6]All four testified that they believed the Soviet Union had provided for material support, training and inspiration for various terrorist groupings.[7] Ledeen was involved in the Iran¨CContra affair as a consultant of National Security Advisor Robert C. McFarlane. Ledeen vouched for Iranian intermediary Manucher Ghorbanifar. In addition, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, officials of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and the Central Intelligence Agency to arrange meetings with high-ranking Iranian officials, whereby U.S supported Iranians would be given weapons by Israel, and would proceed to negotiate with Hizbollah for the release of hostages in Lebanon.[8] Ledeen¡¯s own version of the events is published in his book, Perilous Statecraft.[9] 
Yellowcake forgery allegations[edit] 
Main article: Niger uranium forgeries 
According to a September 2004 article by Joshua Micah Marshall, Laura Rozen, and Paul Glastris in Washington Monthly:[10]¡°The first meeting occurred in Rome in December, 2001. It included Franklin, Rhode, and another American, the neoconservative writer and operative Michael Ledeen, who organized the meeting. (According to UPI, Ledeen was then working for Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith as a consultant.) Also in attendance was Ghorbanifar and a number of other Iranians.¡± 
Colleagues Andrew McCarthy and Mark R. Levin have defended Ledeen, writing[11] 
Up until now, the fiction recklessly spewed by disgruntled intelligence-community retirees and their media enablers¡ªsome of whom have conceded that the claim is based on zero evidence¡ªhas been that Michael had something to do with the forged Italian documents that, according to the Left¡¯s narrative, were the basis for President Bush¡¯s ¡°lie¡± in the 2003 State of the Union Address that Saddam Hussein had obtained yellowcake uranium (for nuclear-weapons construction) in Africa. 
Iraq War advocacy[edit] 
Regarding the ¡°pre-emptive¡± invasion of Iraq, in 2002 Ledeen criticized the views of former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, writing:[12] He fears that if we attack Iraq ¡°I think we could have an explosion in the Middle East. It could turn the whole region into a cauldron and destroy the War on Terror.¡± 
One can only hope that we turn the region into a cauldron, and faster, please. If ever there were a region that richly deserved being cauldronized, it is the Middle East today. If we wage the war effectively, we will bring down the terror regimes in Iraq, Iran, and Syria, and either bring down the Saudi monarchy or force it to abandon its global assembly line to indoctrinate young terrorists. 
That¡¯s our mission in the war against terror. Ledeen specifically called for the deposition of Saddam Hussein¡¯s regime by force in 2002: So it¡¯s good news when Scowcroft comes out against the desperately needed and long overdue war against Saddam Hussein and the rest of the terror masters.[12] and: Question #2: Okay, well if we are all so certain about the dire need to invade Iraq, then when do we do so? Ledeen: Yesterday[13] Ledeen¡¯s statements prior to the start of the Iraq war such as ¡°desperately needed and long overdue war against Saddam Hussein¡± and ¡°dire need to invade Iraq¡± caused Glenn Greenwald to label his later statement that he ¡°opposed the military invasion of Iraq before it took place¡± to be an ¡°outright lie¡±.[14] However, Ledeen maintains these statements are consistent since: ¡°I advocated¡ªas I still do¡ªsupport for political revolution in Iran as the logical and necessary first step in the war against the terror masters.¡±[15] 
Views on Iran[edit] 
Although Ledeen was in favor of invading Iraq, he also believes that Iran should have been the first priority in the ¡°war on terror.¡±[16] The New York Times describes Ledeen¡¯s views as ¡°everything traces back to Tehran¡±.[16] Ledeen¡¯s phrase, ¡°faster, please¡± has become a signature meme in Ledeen¡¯s writings (it is currently the title of his blog on the Pajamas Mediawebsite) and is often referenced by neoconservative writers advocating a more forceful and broader ¡°war on terror.¡± In 1979, Ledeen was one of the first Western writers to argue thatAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was a ¡°clerical fascist¡±, and that while it was legitimate to criticize the Shah¡¯s regime, if Khomeini seized power in Iran the Iranian people would suffer an even greater loss of freedom and women would be deprived of political and social rights. He presently believes that ¡°No one in the West has yet supported Iranian democratic organizations¡± and that ¡°aggressive support for those Iranians who wish to be free¡± would most likely work in ending the clerical government.[17] 
According to Justin Raimondo, Ledeen ¡°holds up Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright as patsies for Khomeini¡ªwho supposedly believed that the Ayatollah overthrew Shah Reza Pahlavibecause the Iranian government was ¡®excessively repressive and intolerant.¡¯ While it would not do to come right out and deny the savagery of the Shah¡¯s legendary SAVAK secret police, Ledeen informs us that, under the monarch¡¯s beneficent rule, ¡®Iran had become too modern, too tolerant¡ªespecially of women and of other religious faiths¡ªand too self-indulgent. The shah had Westernized Iran¡¯¡ªexcept, perhaps, in his prisons, where the ancient methods of torture were routinely employed on dissidents of all sorts.¡±[18] 
Ledeen is currently against both an invasion of Iran or air-strikes within the country.[17][19] He has argued that the latter may eventually become necessary if negotiations with the Iranian government fail, but it would only be the least bad option of many options and it would lead to many negative unforeseen consequences.[19] The New York Times has called Ledeen¡¯s skepticism towards military action against Iran surprising given his opposition to the regime.[16] In October 2007, Ledeen argued that:¡°Those who believe that I am part of some ¡°hawkish gang¡± just haven¡¯t noticed that I am opposed to invasion or bombing the nuclear facilities. My fear is that, by failing to promote a non-violent democratization of Iran, we make large-scale violence much more likely.¡± 
¡°In any event, time will tell, and I share the fear of most commenters [sic] that we will indeed arrive at a horrible choice between Iran with the bomb, or bomb Iran, as Sarkozy and Kouchner have put it. And if that happens, it will demonstrate a terrible failure on the part of the West, including the United States, to craft a serious Iran policy lo these many years.¡±[17]",english,2016-10-29T02:42:13.262+03:00,fellowshipoftheminds.com,US,,Comment on Trump considering a military general for VP by marblenecltr,0,https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/trump-flynn-2016.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

For Hillary Clinton and her accomplice and protector, the Obama administration, Russia is the new, all-purpose bogeyman. 
They say the Russian government is the hacker of those revealing and embarrassing DNC, Hillary and Podesta emails that WikiLeaks has been releasing. 
Hillary even accused Donald Trump of being in cahoots with Moscow. The latest accuser is longtime Democratic strategist James Carville. 
As reported by Edund Kozak for PoliZette , in an appearance on MSNBC yesterday, Oct. 31, 2016, Carville attacked the FBI for reopening its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s emails, calling it part of a vast conspiracy to subvert American democracy. (See ¡° Weinered: FBI reopens investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s emails ¡±) 
Carville raged: 
¡°This is in effect an attempt to hijack an election. It¡¯s unprecedented ¡­ the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy! [FBI Director James] Comey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans. We also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked.¡± 
As noted by Kozak, ¡°Apparently the fact that the Soviet security agency [KGB] was disbanded in 1991 does not preclude its involvement in this vast, anti-Clinton, FBI-organized conspiracy.¡± 
Now, the New York Times reports (via ZeroHedge ) that in an investigation into Russia¡¯s possible involvement in the 2016 presidential election, the FBI concludes that there¡¯s no evidence that Trump is connected with the Russian government: 
¡°For much of the summer, the F.B.I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead ¡ª which they ultimately came to doubt ¡ª about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. 
Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.¡± 
Hey, James Carville, you conniving POS. This message is for you!

But Bryan Cranston could be saying farewell to the United States after the election results are announced. The 60-year-old actor has warned he will move to Canada if Donald Trump becomes the next president.
¡®I would definitely move,¡¯ he told The Bestseller Experiment podcast when asked what he would do if Trump was elected over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. ¡®It¡¯s not real to me that, that would happen. I hope to God it won¡¯t,¡¯ he added. ¡®It wouldn¡¯t be a vacation. I¡¯d be an expatriate,¡¯ Cranston added. 
The Emmy-award winning actor is the latest Hollywood celebrity to pledge to leave the country if the Donald wins the election next week. He joins the likes of Clinton supporters Barbra Streisand, comedian Chelsea Handler and Girls creator and star Lena Dunham who have all said they will move abroad if the Republican presidential candidate wins the vote. No comment necessary We will have to wait and see whether they will keep their promises.
But the opportunity to test them is becoming more and more likley as Trump closes ground on Clinton after the FBI announced it was re-opening the investigation into her email scandal. An ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll released Sunday showed Clinton ahead 46 per cent to 45 ¨C narrower than Saturday¡¯s 2-point Clinton edge. 
Cranston, who more recently played Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, has been an outspoken critic of Trump, branding him a ¡®supreme narcissist¡¯ and an ¡¯emperor without any clothes¡¯ following his controversial campaign . 
The Emmy Award-winner said previously the billionaire tycoon¡¯s rise in politics had ¡®slapped¡¯ Americans in the face and he would eventually be ¡®swept to the side¡¯. ¡®I don¡¯t want to join the vitriol that Donald Trump represents,¡¯ Cranston told the Press Association. ¡®He¡¯s crude and crass and empty headed . If it weren¡¯t serious, it would be laughable. Here we have a reality show, game show guy who¡¯s now at the top of one of the two parties. That there are millions of people who are going to vote for him says something about, perhaps, disenfranchisement. People who are left out. People who don¡¯t feel they are being listened to.¡¯ 
Cranston revealed that he¡¯s met both Trump and Clinton, but his facetime with the billionaire Republican was 20 years ago. ¡®As he was saying hello it was like he was thinking of three or four or five other things, so it didn¡¯t feel like he was actually present,¡¯ Cranston recalled. Obama showing maturity and introspection His meeting with Clinton and another with her husband were improvements. ¡®She asked me questions and I gave my opinion. And I think that¡¯s what I want, I want a president, quite frankly, with what our current president has shown ¨C diplomacy, restraint, introspection, a maturity ¨C he¡¯s not any of those things ,¡¯ Cranston said, moving on to Trump. Hillary showing maturity and introspection ¡®He¡¯s the antitheses of what you¡¯d want a president to be as far as behavior and comportment,¡¯ the actor added. He added that university courses will be taught, books will be written and movies will be made in the future about Trump and this bizarre election.
Cranston, who is a Clinton supporter, said he did not care if his views cost him fans, but that it was his responsibility as a public figure to talk politics as well . ¡®I am willing to take those risks, I don¡¯t want to sit on the sidelines. 
The socially-conscious Cranston joins the growing list of stars who have spoken up for Clinton which also includes Elizabeth Banks, actress America Ferrera and Scandal star Tony Goldwyn, all Hillary Clinton regulars on the campaign trail. 
More than 100 celebrities have also signed on to a MoveOn.org campaign launched on Monday to urge voters not to put Trump in the White House , with Mark Ruffalo, Neil Patrick Harris, Shonda Rhimes, and Macklemore added to the mix.

From Daily Mail : Tess Holliday is using her platform as a model to speak out against Donald Trump and the allegations of sexual assault against him. 
The 31-year-old took to Instagram over the weekend to share an ad of herself posing in New York City¡¯s Times Square while modeling a New Look Fashion T-shirt that reads: ¡®Respect Women #Dump Trump.¡¯ 
¡®Respect Women,¡¯ she captioned the image. ¡®Our bodies are not for you to stare at or touch without our consent. Women are not just sexual objects , women are not here for your consumption. So many of us have a sexual assault story, myself included,¡¯ she continued. 
¡®To endorse someone who not just condones this behavior but actively engages in it would be an awful step backwards for women not just in the US but across the world. #dumptrump #dumptrump #dumptrump The feminist in action 
¡®Also might I add I¡¯m NOT telling you who to vote for. Trump is a pig & that¡¯s a fact. [sic]¡¯ 
The photo, which was taken by her longtime partner Nick Holliday, sees Tess posed with her hands on her hips as she stares at the camera. Along with the white T-shirt, which features black block lettering, she is wearing ripped jeans and black high-heeled sandals. 
The photo has been liked more than 62,000 times since it was posted on Saturday, and unsurprisingly, the political statement caused a stir. 
¡®Love the shirt, Tess,¡¯ one woman wrote. ¡®Way to use your constitutionally protected voice. #activism #freedom #feminism.¡¯ 
And while many supported Tess¡¯ statement, there were plenty of people who disagreed with her. ¡®Such a shame to have to [unfollow] you,¡¯ another woman wrote. ¡®Use your celebrity for something better than being political.¡¯ 
There was also a fierce debate about whether or not Tess¡¯ post could be seen as an endorsement for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, and some people who disagreed with her statement attacked the size 22 model for her weight . 
¡®There is some super hateful stuff on here,¡¯ one woman wrote. ¡®I don¡¯t agree or disagree with your position, but I still admire your message. Why can¡¯t everyone get along! Dang! Everyone gets to have their own opinion people! 
¡®And targeting her weight because you disagree? Really? People are crazy, keep up your positive messages Tess! Whatever your political views are, I still love what you represent girl!¡¯

Trump¡¯s ¡°America We Deserve¡± book came out on 1/15/2000. I¡¯ve learned magnitudes of mind-changing information in 16 years. Maybe Trump has, too (though he obviously does still have some huge blind spots, such as believing whatever the ¡°Nightly News¡± says about anything/everything, from mass shootings [not awake to false flags] to boogeymen terrorists/ISIS [not awake to the fact the CIA/Mossad/MI5/6 create/fund the terrorist groups] to believing the lie that we need to give up privacy for ¡°more security¡± [his current anti-Apple vs. FBI opinion], etc.). Even so, I think Trump is ¡°TEACHABLE,¡± if the right people are given his ear. 
Steve B. said: ¡°¡­I cannot and will not vote for him, until that repudiation of his pro-choice past comes.¡± 
He has told the story quite a few times of his change of opinion re abortion. In short, he had friends who were going to abort but had the baby who then grew up to be a great kid which touched his heart personally. And in just the past few days I heard him say he basically went along with the abortion idea in his prior years because his daughter thought it was an OK thing, so he thought it was an OK thing, too. If Ivanka is nearing 35, then she probably DID think it was OK when she was 20-ish. (He did not say that in a blaming or scapegoating kind of way, btw.) Granted, Trump is obviously NOT a Biblically-discipled follower of Jesus. He may be a BELIEVER in Jesus, but he has obviously never been discipled. Trump needs an Aquila & Priscilla to ¡°¡­take him unto them, and expound unto him the way of God more perfectly.¡± (Acts 18:26). 
Here¡¯s Trump¡¯s anti-abortion statement from two days ago at his FB site. (Of course, I disagree with him still re: exceptions for ¡°rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk.¡± That¡¯s still Lefty hogwash. No baby deserves to be murdered. The baby cannot determine the circumstances. Whatever happened to adoption, for pete¡¯s sake?!): 
[¡­] Donald J. Trump February 16 at 4:11pm 
Let me be clear¡ªI am pro-life. I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me. My story is well documented, so I will not retell it here. However, what I will do with the remaining space is express my feelings about life, and the culture of life, as we approach the 43nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade. 
I build things. There is a process involved in building things. We tap into a lot of disciplines with engineering being one of the most important. The rules for putting structures together are as strict as are the rules of physics. These rules have stood the test of time and have become the path to putting together structures that endure and are beautiful. America, when it is at its best, follows a set of rules that have worked since our founding. One of those rules is that we, as Americans, revere life and have done so since our Founders made it the first, and most important, of our ¡°unalienable¡± rights. 
Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of country. They are missing, and they are missed. 
The Supreme Court in 1973 based their decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found. Even if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress. Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best. 
If using taxpayer money to facilitate our slide to a culture of death was not enough, the 1973 decision became a landmark decision demonstrating the utter contempt the court had for federalism and the 10th Amendment. Roe v. Wade gave the court an excuse to dismantle the decisions of state legislatures and the votes of the people. This is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision. Perhaps Roe v. Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government. 
We are in the middle of a presidential political cycle and votes will be cast in just days. The citizens of this nation will have the chance to vote for candidates that are aligned with their individual worldviews. It is my hope that they will choose the builder, the man who has the ability to imagine the greatness of this nation. The next President must follow those principles that work best and that reinforce the reverence Americans hold for life. A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness. It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again.

Americans didn¡¯t know about a curious species of fakery called Crisis Actors until the Dec. 14, 2012 Sandy Hook false-flag shooting massacre. (See ¡° Remarkable resemblance of Sandy Hook victims and professional crisis actors ¡°) 
Located in Denver, Colorado, a business that calls itself VisionBox Crisis Actors provides professionals (¡°trained players and actors¡±) who impersonate real-life people in simulations of mass casualty events, such as government drills, shootings and bombings, to help ¡°schools and first responders create realistic drills, full-scale exercises, high-fidelity simulations, and interactive 3D films.¡± As an Oct. 31, 2012 feature story on the Crisis Actors website which I found on January 1, 2013, once boasted: 
A new group of actors is now available nationwide for active shooter drills and mall shooting full-scale exercises, announced Visionbox, Denver¡¯s leading professional actors studio. 
Visionbox Crisis Actors are trained in criminal and victim behavior, and bring intense realism to simulated mass casualty incidents in public places. 
The actors¡¯ stage acting experience , ranging from Shakespeare to contemporary American theater, enables them to ¡°stay in character¡± throughout an exercise, and improvise scenes of extreme stress while strictly following official exercise scenarios. [¡­] 
Visionbox Crisis Actors can also play the role of citizens calling 911 or mall management, or posting comments on social media websites. 
For more, see my post ¡° Professional crisis actors simulate mass casualty events ¡°. 
Curiously, since the phenomenon of crisis actors was uncovered after the Sandy Hook false-flag, crisis actors seem to have gone underground. VisionBox revised its website, removing any mention of crisis actors. But this video that was uploaded to YouTube on Dec. 23, 2012, says the same things about VisionBox which I had reported: 
Professor James Tracy also recently discovered that Crisisactors.org , the website established to represent the collaboration between the Visionbox professional actors studio and FEMA¡¯s Emergency Management Institute , went dormant after August 2014. (See ¡° Where Have All the Crisis Actors Gone? ¡°) 
To add to the insanity, there are even amputee crisis actors, such as those from a business called Amputees in Action , which provides ¡°trained professional amputee actors¡± who promise to ¡°remain in character¡±¡°for the film and screen industries and for emergency and military services training simulations¡± with ¡°special effects (SFX) make-up, moulage and prosthetic artists use cutting edge technology to enhance and extend the appearance and function of limb-loss scenarios.¡± (For more, see my post ¡° Did you know there are AMPUTEE crisis actors? ¡°) 
Alleged victim of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, Jeff Bauman, is an example of an amputee crisis actor. See the reasons why in ¡° Hollywood producer Nathan Folks says Boston Bombing¡¯s a false flag ¡±. 
Now add fake political protests and protesters to the things that crisis actors do. 
Jamie Taete reports for Vice , Aug. 6, 2013, that Crowds on Demand is a company that will organize a crowd for you, on demand. The crowd can be fake fans for some celebrity or aspiring celebrity, or fake protesters for a cause. 
Since the company¡¯s fake fan events are ¡°super secret,¡± Taete attended instead ¡°a fake protest¡± called ¡°Purge Day USA¡± (to purge mental health problems) which the company organized in Los Angeles ¡°in coordination with a charity¡± to ¡°raise awareness about mental health issues¡±. Here¡¯s a photo of the fake protesters: 
Crowds on Demand¡¯s founder and CEO Adam Swart said that there were about 20 protesters at the fake protest and all of them were ¡°provided by me¡±. The fake protesters were paid $15 an hour. Swart charges ¡°a couple thousand dollars¡± to organize a fake protest with about 20 actors, but he gives discounts to charities. 
To critics who say Crowds on Demand is unethical, Swart , who is only 24 years old , openly and brazenly admits: ¡°Is it misleading? Yes. That¡¯s the idea.¡± 
A more recent example of fake protesters is an ad on Craig¡¯s List soliciting actors to impersonate protesters at Trump rallies. 
As reported by ZeroHedge on March 30, 2016, the ad was placed by ¡°I¡¯m feelin¡¯ the Bern¡± Bernie Sanders supporters who promise to provide shuttle buses, parking, and protest signs, as well as $15/hour to the actors. Here¡¯s a screenshot of the Craig¡¯s List ad: 
The above ad has since been removed by its author , but the Daily Caller points out the ad is part of a recurring pattern of anti-Trump Craigslist ads soliciting and paying people to protest at Trump rallies. But Daily Caller claims that the fake protesters are hired not by Sanders, but by Hillary Clinton¡¯s people, and paid for by the usual suspects George Soros, MoveOn.org, and Progressive Auto Insurance ¡®s Jonathan Lewis : 
The Establishment on both the left and the right, who want to disenfranchise the millions of Republican voters who support Donald Trump, have blamed the staged riots near Trump rallies on Trump or on Bernie Sanders. That¡¯s like blaming the Russians for the Reichstag Fire. Bernie has little to do with these manufactured protests. This is a Clinton operation, a faux protest. 
False flag operations have long been common in politics, but these riots are poisonous to the electorate, intentionally designed to turn violent and stifle free speech. 
This free speech-busting goon squad operation is directed by supporters of Hillary Clinton. It is paid for mostly by George Soros and MoveOn.org and pushed by David Brock at Media Matters for America. It¡¯s also funded by reclusive billionaire Jonathan Lewis, who was identified by the Miami New Times as a ¡°mystery man.¡± He inherited roughly a billion dollars from his father Peter Lewis (founder of Progressive Insurance Company). 
A march and demonstration against Trump at Trump Tower essentially fizzled Saturday when only 500 ¡°protesters¡± of the promised 5000 showed up. Infiltrating the crowd, I learned most were from MoveOn or the Occupy movement. Soap was definitely in short supply in this crowd. Several admitted answering a Craig¡¯s list ad paying $16.00 an hour for protesters. 
Hillary understands that Trump would lose the votes of certain establishment Republicans if he were the nominee. On the other hand, it doesn¡¯t matter, because of his crossover outreach. In Michigan, Democrats and independents who have lost their jobs because of disastrous globalist trade deals like NAFTA are lining up to vote for Donald. 
And so, when you see an anti-Trump protest or another mass shooting, don¡¯t believe your eyes. The ¡°protesters¡± and ¡°victims¡±¡ª including amputees! ¡ª you see may just be acting.

From Entertainment Weekly : Every four years, around this time, you start to hear them: the dissatisfied voters who threaten to move to Canada if their candidate loses. With the presidential election looming, such discussions have reached a fever pitch, but what about our political experts? Surely they¡¯re not thinking of fleeing north, too? 
EW sat down with Rachel Maddow a few weeks ago to pick her brain about the election and her broadcasting career, from hosting The Rachel Maddow Show (weekdays at 9 p.m. on MSNBC) to co-anchoring MSNBC¡¯s primetime political coverage with Brian Williams. We asked her the same question that¡¯s on a lot of liberals¡¯ minds: If Donald Trump wins the presidency, will she pack up and move to Canada? Not a chance. 
¡°First of all, my mother would kill me,¡± Maddow says, laughing. ¡°My mother escaped Newfoundland in order to come here. Seriously, there¡¯s nothing to make you appreciate the United States more than having an immigrant parent .¡± 
Canadian connections aside, Maddow says she¡¯s definitely staying, even if a Trump presidency could have radical effects on her chosen profession . 
¡°Trump says that once he¡¯s president, ¡® Media¡¯s not going to get away with the stuff they get away with now. We¡¯re going to change those libel laws! ¡¯¡± Maddow says. ¡°He blacklisted the freaking Washington Post from covering him. So who knows what it¡¯s going to be like with Trump as president? Who knows how he¡¯ll use his power to try and destroy the press? ¡± 
Still, Maddow says she¡¯s not going anywhere. 
¡°If he does what he¡¯s promising to do, I don¡¯t know if any of our jobs will exist any more,¡± Maddow says. ¡°But as long as someone will have me, I¡¯ll do this job.¡±",english,2016-11-07T03:49:17.900+02:00,fellowshipoftheminds.com,US,,Comment on Rachel Maddow declares that a Trump presidency could have radical effects on her chosen profession by Anonymous,0,https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/drama.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

(DVIDSHUB, Flickr) By John Pilger / newmatilda.com 
The American journalist, Edward Bernays, is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. 
The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho-analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term ¡°public relations¡± as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions. 
In 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade ¨C behaviour then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, ¡°Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!¡± 
Bernays¡¯ influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret, he said, was ¡°engineering the consent¡± of people in order to ¡°control and regiment [them]according to our will without their knowing about it¡±. 
He described this as ¡°the true ruling power in our society¡± and called it an ¡°invisible government¡±. 
Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives as it does now, and to go unchallenged. 
Imagine two cities. Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. 
But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties. (IMAGE: The U.S. Army, Flickr) 
In the second city ¨C in another country nearby ¨C almost exactly the same thing is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. 
The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by ¡°us¡±¨C by the United States and Britain. They even have a media centre that is funded by Britain and America. 
Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys, condemned for assaulting and bombing the city ¨C which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city. 
Confusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain, and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad. 
What is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. 
Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today. 
Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was ¡°vindicated¡± for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell¡¯s fabrications. Former US president George W Bush (IMAGE: Peter Stevens, Flickr) 
The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, ¡°What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?¡± 
He replied that if journalists had done their job, ¡°there is a very, very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq¡±. 
It was a shocking statement, and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question ¨C Dan Rather of CBS, David Rose of the Observer and journalists and producers in the BBC, who wished to remain anonymous. 
In other words, had journalists done their job, had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children would be alive today, and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul. 
There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on 7th July 2005. There would have been no flight of millions of refugees; there would be no miserable camps. 
When the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November, President Francoise Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria ¨C and more terrorism followed, predictably, the product of Hollande¡¯s bombast about France being ¡°at war¡± and ¡°showing no mercy¡±. That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak. 
¡°When the truth is replaced by silence,¡± said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko, ¡°the silence is a lie.¡± 
The attack on Iraq, the attack on Libya, the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West. The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant. They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country. 
The same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an ¡°agreement¡± that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy. His people were bombed, and he was prosecuted in The Hague. Independence of this kind is intolerable.? 
As WikLeaks has revealed, it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, that he was attacked. 
From that moment, the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics ¨C the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage. 
Why is this not news? The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross, who was responsible for operating sanctions against Iraq, told me: ¡°We would feed journalists factoids of sanitised intelligence, or we would freeze them out. That is how it worked.¡± 
The West¡¯s medieval client, Saudi Arabia ¨C to which the US and Britain sell billions of dollars¡¯ worth of arms ¨C is at present destroying Yemen, a country so poor that in the best of times, half the children are malnourished. 
Look on YouTube and you will see the kind of massive bombs ¨C¡°our¡± bombs ¨C that the Saudis use against dirt-poor villages, and against weddings, and funerals. 
The explosions look like small atomic bombs. The bomb aimers in Saudi Arabia work side-by-side with British officers. This fact is not on the evening news. 
Propaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education ¨C Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Columbia ¨C and with careers on the BBC, the Guardia n, the New York Times , the Washington Post . 
These organisations are known as the liberal media. They present themselves as enlightened, progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist. They are anti-racist, pro-feminist and pro-LGBT. 
And they love war. 
While they speak up for feminism, they support rapacious wars that deny the rights of countless women, including the right to life. 
In 2011, Libya, then a modern state, was destroyed on the pretext that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit genocide on his own people. That was the incessant news; and there was no evidence. It was a lie. An anti-Gaddafi rally, Libya 2011. (IMAGE: mojomogwai , Flickr) 
In fact, Britain, Europe and the United States wanted what they like to call ¡°regime change¡± in Libya, the biggest oil producer in Africa. Gaddafi¡¯s influence in the continent and, above all, his independence were intolerable. 
So he was murdered with a knife in his rear by fanatics, backed by America, Britain and France. Hillary Clinton cheered his gruesome death for the camera, declaring, ¡°We came, we saw, he died!¡± 
The destruction of Libya was a media triumph. As the war drums were beaten, Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian : ¡°Though the risks are very real, the case for intervention remains strong.¡± 
Intervention ¨C what a polite, benign, Guardian word, whose real meaning, for Libya, was death and destruction. 
According to its own records, Nato launched 9,700 ¡°strike sorties¡± against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. They included missiles with uranium warheads. Look at the photographs of the rubble of Misurata and Sirte, and the mass graves identified by the Red Cross. The Unicef report on the children killed says, ¡°most [of them]under the age of 10¡±. 
As a direct consequence, Sirte became the capital of ISIS. 
Ukraine is another media triumph. Respectable liberal newspapers such as the New York Times , the Washington Post and the Guardian , and mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC, NBC, CBS, CNN have played a critical role in conditioning their viewers to accept a new and dangerous cold war. 
All have misrepresented events in Ukraine as a malign act by Russia when, in fact, the coup in Ukraine in 2014 was the work of the United States, aided by Germany and Nato. 
This inversion of reality is so pervasive that Washington¡¯s military intimidation of Russia is not news; it is suppressed behind a smear and scare campaign of the kind I grew up with during the first cold war. Once again, the Ruskies are coming to get us, led by another Stalin, whom The Economist depicts as the devil. 
The suppression of the truth about Ukraine is one of the most complete news blackouts I can remember. The fascists who engineered the coup in Kiev are the same breed that backed the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Of all the scares about the rise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe, no leader ever mentions the fascists in Ukraine ¨C except Vladimir Putin, but he does not count.? Russian president Vladimir Putin. (IMAGE: IoSonoUnaFotoCamera, Flickr) 
Many in the Western media have worked hard to present the ethnic Russian-speaking population of Ukraine as outsiders in their own country, as agents of Moscow, almost never as Ukrainians seeking a federation within Ukraine and as Ukrainian citizens resisting a foreign-orchestrated coup against their elected government. 
There is almost the joie d¡¯esprit of a class reunion of warmongers. The drum-beaters of the Washington Post inciting war with Russia are the very same editorial writers who published the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. 
To most of us, the American presidential campaign is a media freak show, in which Donald Trump is the arch villain. 
But Trump is loathed by those with power in the United States for reasons that have little to do with his obnoxious behaviour and opinions. To the invisible government in Washington, the unpredictable Trump is an obstacle to America¡¯s design for the 21st century. 
This is to maintain the dominance of the United States and to subjugate Russia, and, if possible, China. 
To the militarists in Washington, the real problem with Trump is that, in his lucid moments, he seems not to want a war with Russia; he wants to talk with the Russian president, not fight him; he says he wants to talk with the president of China. 
In the first debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump promised not to be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into a conflict. He said, ¡°I would certainly not do first strike. Once the nuclear alternative happens, it¡¯s over.¡± That was not news. 
Did he really mean it? Who knows? He often contradicts himself. But what is clear is that Trump is considered a serious threat to the status quo maintained by the vast national security machine that runs the United States, regardless of who is in the White House. 
The CIA wants him beaten. The Pentagon wants him beaten. The media wants him beaten. Even his own party wants him beaten. He is a threat to the rulers of the world ¨C unlike Clinton who has left no doubt she is prepared to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and China. US Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. (IMAGE: Gage Skidmore, Flickr) 
Clinton has the form, as she often boasts. Indeed, her record is proven. As a senator, she backed the bloodbath in Iraq. When she ran against Obama in 2008, she threatened to ¡°totally obliterate¡± Iran. As Secretary of State, she colluded in the destruction of governments in Libya and Honduras and set in train the baiting of China. 
She has now pledged to support a No Fly Zone in Syria ¡ª a direct provocation for war with Russia. Clinton may well become the most dangerous president of the United States in my lifetime ¨Ca distinction for which the competition is fierce. 
Without a shred of evidence, she has accused Russia of supporting Trump and hacking her emails. Released by WikiLeaks, these emails tell us that what Clinton says in private, in speeches to the rich and powerful, is the opposite of what she says in public. 
That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders. 
Today, the greatest build-up of American-led forces since World War Two is under way ¨C in the Caucasus and eastern Europe, on the border with Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, where China is the target. 
Keep that in mind when the presidential election circus reaches its finale on November 8th, If the winner is Clinton, a Greek chorus of witless commentators will celebrate her coronation as a great step forward for women. None will mention Clinton¡¯s victims: the women of Syria, the women of Iraq, the women of Libya. None will mention the civil defence drills being conducted in Russia. None will recall Edward Bernays¡¯¡°torches of freedom¡±. Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. (IMAGE: iprimages , Flickr) 
George Bush¡¯s press spokesman once called the media ¡°complicit enablers¡±. 
Coming from a senior official in an administration whose lies, enabled by the media, caused such suffering, that description is a warning from history. 
In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German media: ¡°Before every major aggression, they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically for the attack. In the propaganda system, it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons.¡±

Presidential elections are a form of madness that comes over us once every four years. They fit the great-man or -woman narrative of history, seducing us into forgetting how powerful we are. They erase our memory of grassroots power, direct democracy and civil society. Leaders beget followers; people pin their hopes on one person, and with that they seem to shed responsibility for anything beyond getting that one person into office. Or, they wash their hands of any further involvement if it¡¯s not their one person. 
And so it is this time around. With the election a matter of days away and the media engrossed in a fight to end all fights, it sometimes seems as though we¡¯ve lost sight of the powers that belong to us and not them, and the responsibilities and possibilities that go with our power. The intensely personal nature of this campaign ¨C and the particular danger of Donald Trump ¨C has created a kind of tunnel vision. 
""We forget our own influence, the innumerable times we¡¯ve swayed outcome."" 
Which is not to say that the outcome is unimportant. Far from it. Many Clinton supporters seem quietly confident of a win. I am less complacent. We¡¯ve had enough surprises this year ¨C in Britain, in Colombia ¨C to know that voters have a way of confounding those who observe them. A Trump presidency would be a terrible thing. But a Clinton victory would be far from an occasion to sigh with relief, sit back and resume life as though the last few months had been a bad dream. A Clinton victory, in fact, would be just a starting point for a new kind of campaign. 
A politician is not a given. Each one is in part what we make them, by pushing, blocking, pressuring, encouraging, fighting, reframing, emphasizing, organizing. Every election season we pretend that one person will have all the power and that whatever they promise up front is exactly who they¡¯ll be, for better or worse. We forget our own influence, the innumerable times we¡¯ve swayed outcomes, such as the decision to veto the Keystone XL pipeline. We forget the way culture and activism set the norms for political decisions on matters such as same-sex marriage rights. 
Election seasons erase the memory of movements that worked for years or decades, outside and around, below and above electoral politics. They drown out the histories that matter: how women got the vote, how the civil rights movement progressed, how the Free Trade Area of the Americas trade deal withered and died, how the World Trade Organization was hobbled and its poorer member nations inspired to revolt by the great 1999 shutdown in Seattle, how fracking got banned in New York State, how rape law has been radically revised in many ways and places thanks to feminist action and discourse. In all these cases, the people who we mislabel leaders only followed the will of the people. 
To reiterate: it matters who is president, but what a president does has everything to do with what the people demand or refuse or do themselves, and what the House and Senate send them or sabotage. 
Mitt Romney promised to build the Keystone XL pipeline himself if elected; Republicans for the foreseeable future will be puppets of the fossil-fuel industry. Democrats are not necessarily our friends or allies, but they are sometimes politicians who can be pushed. Obama wavered on that pipeline for several years. When he vetoed it, it was not because of who he is, but because of who we are, we the members of a climate movement that organized, educated, campaigned, blockaded and demonstrated for years, building a powerful movement. 
That the president has become so much more engaged with climate is a result what the movement did: it educated us on the science, made the case for the urgency and importance of action, built global coalitions, shed light on the ways climate is an economic and racial justice issue, started innumerable campaigns to block pipelines, divest, implement efficiency and good design, and shift to renewable resources. A lot of other changes that matter have happened at the local level as cities, regions and states have done great work on climate, led by community organizers, small groups and minor politicians you¡¯ll never hear about. 
The Obama administration could have done much more if more of the people who elected him stuck around to push back against the corporations, well-organized conservatives and big-money interests. Which is not to even raise the question of that administration¡¯s principles; it¡¯s more useful to ask what are our own, if most of us do little or nothing about policies we deplore or ideals we praise. 
The same will be true of a Clinton administration, if that¡¯s the one voters choose on Tuesday. The extent to which it serves the interests of people and our planet depends in part on the extent to which citizens apply pressure to it. You may feel exhausted right now; tired of a bruising cycle which has left no personal stone unturned (often to the detriment of policy scrutiny). But the truth is, we¡¯re at the beginning ¨C either of a period of sustained resistance against a racist, misogynist, deranged climate-denier ¨C or a period of sustained action to push the first female president to deliver a genuinely progressive, climate-conscious agenda. 
If we end up with a Democrat (and I regret that that¡¯s the best choice we get in this binary election), a lot is up to us. That¡¯s a gift and a responsibility. I¡¯ll take it. I hope you¡¯ll join me.

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton ¨C truly two representatives of a derailed world. Both hold up a mirror to our current society. One spoke for the establishment; the other for people's rage against the establishment. Rage prevailed, yet both represent the exact same system, just from two different angles. The fact that Trump won, taking into account all the outrageous things he said, shows what kind of turbulent revolt arises among large parts of the American population. It is the revolt of people who feel betrayed by an unfathomable system and who call for, as so often already, a strong leader. Thus the unrestrained demagogue gets on stage, calling for restoring the nation, for security and unity, and the common fight against all those who could disturb this unity. Sorry to say, w hat comes together here is something we have already once seen in the collective insanity under Hitler. But things will not go so far this time because there is neither a concept nor a political vision behind all these ¡°tremendous¡± words. Through the grotesque victory of this megalomaniac player, a movement for freedom could arise in the United States, one which strives for new objectives beyond the existing parties. In addition, positive counter-powers rise up across the globe ¨C these are the ones that will set the course of things on a new track. Both ways, the one of Trump and Clinton alike, aim toward a deeply inhumane world; both generate unspeakably many victims. The emotional substratum Donald Trump activates is directed against all those of another race, religion or sexual identity. This is self-protection by way of exterminating others. Hillary Clinton pursues the policies of the political class, of calculated globalization, in collaboration with the international dictatorship of financial power, generating victims in all parts of the planet that are subdued by this globalization. This is the self-protection of the dominating system through market strategies and military force. Donald Trump has alleviated the souls of his audience by granting them permission to think the thoughts they anyway do. It has been a fundamental feature throughout human history that people come to power who are able to mobilize the subliminal ¡°mass psychology of fascism¡± as Wilhelm Reich called it ¨C this hunger for unity under a powerful ruler. This story has been repeating for millennia and will continue repeating until we put an end to it. Humanity needs a new life order with a new vision of leadership and unity. What is meant is not external leadership, but leadership coming from within . It is not the unity proclaimed through banners and election slogans, but the inner unity of people who coexist in trust to assist fellow beings and serve the Earth. We refer to the unity in the natural connectedness with the great family of life ¨C in the self-evident empathy, love and solidarity that immediately come into being when we reach the basis of trust, mutual acceptance and truth. This is the foundation for a life in love, power and health. Another kind of society will arise from this fundament, no longer based on power and capital, but on the truth within human relations. And if our estimate is right, this society will be compatible with the higher order of life, which we call the ¡°Sacred Matrix.¡± This movement will give rise to many new centers, birthplaces of a new planetary community. We need to get there, otherwise we will content ourselves with substitutive solutions that regularly lead to catastrophes. As humanity we have long worked with these substitutions. We have set up ideological, political, religious and moral systems intending to secure a fulfilled existence for ourselves. Yet now we are collectively facing the edge of abyss. The era of these substitutions has come to an end. Fascism was a substitution; capitalism was a substitution; the ideas of power and obedience, of autocracy and democracy were a substitution; the Catholic Church was a substitution; the mystic paths all the way to Nirvana were a substitution. The Chosen People, all the smaller and bigger empires, all gods were a substitution; and renouncing all gods and teaching materialistic nihilism was a substitution too. Today, we need another solution on a different social, interpersonal, ethical and spiritual foundation. We need a solution based on truth among real people, above all between the genders, man and woman, because this is the realm that has been most terribly destroyed by the violence of patriarchal history. In other words, if we want to end the worldwide injustice and the unspeakable suffering of humanity and the animal kingdom, we need to base the entire civilization of this planet on another foundation. Neither Trump nor Clinton will assist us here; what is required is a fundamental correction of our civilization and a new vision for inhabiting our planet. I know this sounds out of touch with reality, but it is inevitable and can clearly be done. If there is the vision of a humane existence on Earth it can also be realized. All people are made of the same matter. It is not just fantasy when we see the ONE, which is the same in everyone, within ourselves and all fellow citizens of this planet. We all come from the same universe, are reached by the same sun and have all come to this world from between the enormous legs of our Great Mother. We all share the same longing for love and peace. We all are happy about the friendliness of our alleged opponents ¨C and we all would be able to make this friendliness our guiding orientation, could we let go of old, negative forces. For example in Colombia ¨Cit is clear that there are the same souls, the same young people, the same hopes and goals in both conflicting parties. It is clear that there is a potential friendship behind this cruel hostility. Isn't it also clear that there is an original love even behind the fiercest relationship crises, that which has once brought the two together? Likewise, there is another possibility of existence behind the entire massacre of this world, which we recognize when we are not entangled in conflicts. We can understand what love is, how to follow its rules and what a global community of love could look like. We can also see the social, ecological and ethical preconditions needed to make it happen. These preconditions give rise to a new concept of coexistence among people, as well as between people and animals, people and nature. This is what we call the ¡° Global Healing Biotopes Project .¡± Slowly spreading, the project works to create a new global field stronger than all violence. We do not tolerate any cruelty on this planet. In the name of love for all that lives.

How do we respond to this confusing moment? What do we do now? How do we recover? By Adebayo Akomolafe / bayoakomolafe.net 
Let us acknowledge these difficult feelings of loss, these terrifying thoughts that are suddenly very alive in the air today. It is as if Pandora¡¯s Box has not only been emptied out into the world, but that it has been mass-produced and spread out to the corners of all lands. Hope now seems in short supply. We are undone. 
I write you because things have indeed fallen apart. While this unspeakable insurgency of despair might goad us into rushing into the next ¡®organizational moment¡¯¨C the itch to hit them back or do something ¨C I want to invite us to slow down and pay attention to the stark grief that haunts us now. She stares us in the face, this repulsive visitor. If we must survive, we must return her gaze and let her do her important work with us. 
I am a Nigerian living in India. But like most people on the planet that tuned in to the surrealism of the 2016 American presidential campaigns, I woke up to the shocking news that Donald Trump was not only beating Hillary Clinton on election day, but that there was a frightening possibility he could win. And then that distant possibility, once laughably out of the question, became a gut-wrenching reality-to-come. Hillary¡¯s ¡®blue wall¡¯ fell to the man who promised to build more; the media people stuttered as their once pristine cast of glossy pundits groped for words; the Mexican peso fell. And in one fell swoop, it felt like America, the so-called home of the brave was exactly that : a place dyed in fear, where braveness would now be required to keep on living. 
Ever since Donald Trump became the 45 th president of the United States, the internet has been flooded with articles attempting to make sense of this story-bursting, crystal-ball-shattering moment. Politico published a piece with a title that must have resonated with many people around the world: ¡°How did everyone get it so wrong?¡± The London-based Independent insisted that ¡°Donald Trump would have lost US election if Bernie Sanders had been the candidate¡±, while Thomas Frank opined on the pages of The Guardian that ¡°Donald Trump is moving to the White House, and liberals put him there¡±. Across the fractured landscape of YouTubia, self-professed Trumpists ¨C also surprised by their fortune ¨C laughed at liberals, mocking the ¡®feminazis¡¯ that thought Hillary Clinton ¨C an admittedly troubled candidate who didn¡¯t seem to have a message beyond insisting on her entitlement ¨C would simply waltz into the White House. 
I will not attempt to pry open the cadaver of this moment ¨C it is probably the case that no post-mortem analysis is good enough to assuage our feelings of shock. What happened is not reducible to a single causative factor or a decidable ¡®active ingredient¡¯. The world isn¡¯t that simple. I will however state, in the spirit of full disclosure ¨C the kind of radical honesty we probably need at this time ¨C that I secretly wanted this to happen: I was so invested in the idea of a Sanders presidency (and so mortified by what was obvious to me as an establishmentarian attempt to stifle his voice) that I became possessed by a schadenfreude I couldn¡¯t easily exorcise. I understood the dangers of a potential Trump presidency, but decided even that was better off to the inertia of the neoliberal status quo as embodied by a Hillary Clinton regime. That argument is not easily maintained in the face of the orange predicament we now find ourselves in. 
In an all-too-real case of ¡°be careful what you wish for¡±, I find not relief but a painful sympathy with many who had hoped that the morning of 9 th would somehow usher in a more tolerant America. A more beautiful country. A country that cares about its many colours and contours. Now because of Trump and the energies he has activated, minorities are probably less safe. At a time of unprecedented racial tensions and phallic exhibitions of gunmanship, some folks are already dreading their next brief visit to the shopping mall, knowing that the streets are now being painted red with hate, white with racial acrimony and blind nativism, and blue with the authoritarian aloofness of a candidate who promised ¡®law and order¡¯. The new America. 
It is to these vulnerable ones I write. Those of you that care about diversity, about the environment, about the beauty of queer sexual orientations, about indigenous lands and their right to thrive, and about policing practices that have led to the deaths of many black men and women. 
Without pre-empting Donald Trump or falling into the trap of disillusioned punditry ¨C and yet with a keen awareness of the likely consequences of his presidency ¨C I ask: how do we respond to this? What do we do? How do we recover? What opportunities are presenting themselves to us to work for (with) a caring world? At the time of writing this letter, there is news of revolt on the streets of Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and other American cities. People are protesting the rise of Trump. People are angry. Around this same time, famed documentarian Michael Moore has suggested concerned Americans should ¡®fire the punditry¡¯ and ¡®take over the Democratic party¡¯. It is impossible to answer the question of what a ¡®right¡¯ response is, or to speak as if one is situated outside the swirl and flow of things. I do however want to invite you to try doing something less spectacular¡­something small, for it is my opinion that with Trump, the seeds of a ¡®new¡¯ politics may yet be planted. 
When I was growing up in Christian Nigeria, I was taught to think of my life only in terms of its ¡®greatness quotient¡¯. I was conditioned early to yearn for prominence. Fame. Fortune. Legacy. Success. ¡®Awakening the Giant Within¡¯. Getting to the top. Lasting forever. Those were resonant memes in my developmental years. The figures of Mandela, Bill Gates, Jack Welch, and Jesus were placed before me as aspirational objects. If I did not do all I can to increase my ¡®greatness quotient¡¯, my life did not really matter. 
I suspect this story is not uniquely mine to tell. We live in a world that places priority in the ¡®top¡¯ and discountenances the ¡®bottom¡¯. The condition for living a life of meaning and purpose was moral probity: the stunning city of bigness only admitted those who walked the straight and narrow way, I was told. 
Well, if all that held true once, November 8 was a spectacular repudiation. Donald Trump, ill-prepared, a self-decorated humble person, and one who had said awful things about women, attained the highest office in America ¨C his face beamed on to the Empire State Building in New York amidst the pomp and pageantry that defined his life. The Joker won¡­and nothing adds up anymore. Punditry is broken. Polls are broken. The sure-banker firepower of celebrity is broken. Virtue is broken. 
Trump strolled to the grand stage up in the front and wrecked it, but in so doing he inadvertently ¡®gave¡¯ us permission to inhabit the aisles ¨C to rearrange the entire room. By becoming president, Trump disturbs the idea that the top is worth reaching ¨C not because he is so vile that his new position as president denigrates the office, but because his unprecedented campaign and quest for power shakes us loose to recognize that where we stand is a thick place, sewn through and through with voices and potential and power. 
The stunning revelation of these times of upheaval is that ¡®winning¡¯ is defunct, and new relational modes are desperately needed: the red tape, the raised chair, the grand stage, the green room, and the white house are not the interesting, glorified objects they once were. The emperor has lost his clothes. This whole idea that greatness is some end goal to be achieved by the morally pure, the experienced, and the hardworking, has itself been reworked. And we are left with an awkward coming to terms with the fact that life isn¡¯t a highway but an ecology of small things and ordinary becomings. 
The way forward is thus awkward ¨C or rather, there is no clear algorithm on what to do now except perhaps, among other things, to pay close attention to these twists and turns, these rabbit holes and tricky terrains. To take a critical look at the material details of our lives outside of the lenses of identity politics. An immaculate straight line was never ¡®there¡¯ to begin with. We are left with these small lives the media pretends doesn¡¯t really matter until you achieve celebrity status; we are left with the first stuttering words of a politics that invites us to the incommensurability of our small hours, and ¨C in place of our fascination with distant power and oh-so-shiny things ¨C urges an attention to our bodies, our relationships, our communities, our hidden miracles, our own stories, and our own knowings. 
Let me spell it out¡­what I suggest we can do. Please understand that I do not offer these points with any confidence in their stability or with any sort of finality. I offer them sensing that this moment could very well be that bright spot in the middle of a shadow, affording us an opportunity to co-create a politics that does not terminate with concession speeches ¨C a politics that is not tied so stubbornly to single candidates and anorexic voting lines. I sing the songs of other places of power: Embrace the fact that the world is larger than our plots: 
The plot of a story is both its gentle guiding hand and its suffocating grip, helping it move along but also blinding it from realizing that life is bigger, sterner, and more promiscuous than its logic. I could have sworn that with Bernie Sanders¡¯ candidacy, the world was finally stepping into an age of deeper justice and beauty ¨C that evolutionary moment we all await. His ¡®failure¡¯ to clinch the nomination was a chastising moment for many keen followers of the American primaries. I slowly came to terms with the fact that the world is not beholden to my liberal fantasies. Simply put, the map is not the terrain. The world stretches far and wide beyond our blind spots, our analyses, and our convictions about what justice looks like. Let grief do her work: 
Globalizing society hardly has any place left for grief. When we get uncomfortable, we are urged to pull ourselves together and get back on the wheel. I reckon that today¡¯s grief has something to teach us; there is a genius to its workings that allow a shift in how we relate with the world. I do not mean that we should all sit down and hold hands. I do however feel we can acknowledge that we are in a mess, and adjourn the quest for a palliative solution for the time being. Perhaps instead of counting down to 2020, or calling on Michelle Obama to run for office, we can use these days to investigate the edges of our politics. I believe grief disciplines us for this slow kind of work. What is at stake here is more than a liberal agenda, it is how we see the world and therefore how we maintain power structures that no longer serve our fondest hopes. At least for the moment, nurture a suspicion for shiny objects : 
We have become a photogenic people ¨C attracted to the spectacular, repulsed by the unseemly. We live in cosmetic pixels. With selfies, Instagram posts, televised news that seems more committed to graphics and bloated soundtracks, and the ongoing digitization of relationships, our lives have been reduced to images ¨C and we are forgetting the art of living in the spaces between those images. We are thus habituated to a regime of visuality that defines what is real to us ¨C and silences/excludes other voices from mattering. Perhaps the reason why most people were shocked by the news of Trump¡¯s win was because they were contained by narratives and material conditions that forced a certain view about America. But then the terrain met the map. We need a new set of eyes. Find the others: 
When things break, we are afforded an opportunity to make reconfigurations. This perhaps is a good time to investigate the contours of our relationships with others, with those we love, with our neighbourhoods, with the strangers who breeze past us in a blur of inconsequentiality. American politics is premised on fixed identity categories ¨C that Democrats and Republicans are essentially two aspects of an adversarial binary. To a large extent, each side sees the other as a noxious blight on the face of the country. The first moments of ¡®healing this divide¡¯ is the recognition that even evil has a story, that those persons who hate black people, or curse at ¡®the gays¡¯, didn¡¯t just spring out from the earth, fully realized and fleshed out. In a sense that often escapes us, we are unfolding, hyphenated aspects of each other. None of us is on the side of ¡®good¡¯. Donald Trump and the people that support him are just as much a product of the same media-infused, economically imperilled, people-denying politics that have created us. In a game of sides, the greatest loss we suffer is the other side. Let us leave room for the outlier, for the strange, and for the unexpected. We are not as ¡®sorted out¡¯ as we think we are. Notice the ground upon which you stand: 
I like to say that falling could very well be flying, without the tyranny of coordinates. Technically speaking, falling objects are actually the gravitational pull of attraction between objects. I won¡¯t succumb to, or insist that, we are being ushered into a more glorious paradigm of politics¡­I cannot make that claim. There are however sympathies between place and feet, between our stories and our contexts, that call on us to participate in the sacredness of where we are. What attracts you now? What questions matter to you? What performances of place are pressing themselves upon you? What do you do every day? Where do you come from? Does that question make sense? A friend, Eric Chisler, put this sentiment this way: ¡°Remember the earth. Remember your ancestors. Remember your four-legged, winged, crawling relatives. Remember life. Your life, your way of living, that is the only activism you¡¯ve ever had. Use it. Make your existence a ritual that honors everything your body and words touch. The times are troubled and you are needed. Wake up¡ªnotice the consequence of every action and non-action. You are needed. You are needed. You are needed.¡± The confusion about what to do next is redemptive : 
If you are still confused about what this all means, how anyone could vote for Trump, what the future holds and how to respond to this proto-crisis of sorts, count yourself among the lucky ones. Confusion and uncertainty are how multiple agencies negotiate directionality ¨C and this ongoing process is important. Even inertia isn¡¯t determinately still. We must slowdown in these times of urgency, and allow other agentic forces to reshape us. 
It might be the case that within the specificity of your own context, you know what to do. That¡¯s great. March on the streets. Print BLM tee-shirts. Learn how to plant your own food. Investigate your ancestry. Or open a gift shop and invite passers-by to get free hugs. Out of the logic of our emergence, new moments are distilled and new activisms become possible. We must be humble enough to recognize that the ¡®right thing¡¯ to do is almost always known in retrospect, and that justice is always justice-in-the-making. Small lives matter: 
Finally, don¡¯t beat yourself up for not saving the day. Even if some archaic policy were conjured by the White House, annulling president-elect Trump¡¯s win, it still wouldn¡¯t do much to address the politics that made him happen. The fight is not so much with Trump as it is for a new way of meeting our own selves ¨C a way of speaking with those we consider ¡®other than us¡¯. In short, we must turn to each other, for it is in the smallness of our embrace that new worlds burst into life. 

All considered, would it have been great to have a woman president? Yes. That would have assured many of their place in the world and told them that they are valued and needed and worthy of love. And yet, that message finds a more interesting home now that we have lost our way¡­now that hope seems faraway. 
The politics that knocks on our doors right now doesn¡¯t have to wait for the next four years. Let your campaigns of sacred enlivenment continue.

Trump is an egotistical racist misogynist who, in a rational world, shouldn¡¯t be in any position of power. Then again, neither should Hillary Clinton. We watched from afar (as ¡®afar¡¯ as the internet allows anyhow) as the 2016 presidential campaign rolled on, and, at first, we wanted Bernie Sanders to win, and were very glad to see just how much support he managed to get, but then, Bernie did two Very Bad Things; he said he was okay with Obama¡¯s Blacklist and his usage of drone strikes, and he said that he¡¯d support Clinton if he didn¡¯t get the nomination. Some people held on to Bernie, but for many of us, for me, that was it. Bernie might still have claimed to be ¡®better¡¯, but he certainly couldn¡¯t claim to be ¡®good¡¯. We also watched the political establishment ignore Bernie and shove Clinton ahead of the self described ¡®socialist¡¯. We watched as even people like John Oliver and the entire cast of Saturday Night Live attacked Trump viciously and tried to pave the way to a Clinton victory. Oliver even took it upon himself to attack and ridicule minor candidates like Stein & Johnson, but not Clinton. We watched as so-called liberals and so-called democrats made Clinton out to be a hero. We watched as all those people bent over backwards and pretended that Clinton was one of the good guys because they felt compelled to pick between the ¡®lesser of two evils¡¯. It was pathetic. There¡¯s a bit of fatality involved here, to be sure, and a deep level of cynicism. Many of us feel that if America could not choose the best option, then it deserved the worst. Also, there¡¯s a harsh desire for rough truth, rather than hypocritical garnish. In a sense, many Americans are Trump, but most of them like to think of themselves as closer in character to who Clinton (falsely) claims to be; liberal, democratic, leftist, humane, charitable, kind. There are some who faced the facts honestly, and admitted that, for all intents and purposes, Clinton was a criminal and a manipulator who plays ball with the worst human rights offenders on the planet (Saudi Arabia and Israel, for example) and relies on their financial and political support. They understood that when promising to continue Obama¡¯s legacy, Clinton is in fact promising to kill another 4,000 innocent Pakistanis by drone strikes in an illegal attempt to murder untried ¡®terrorists¡¯. They understand that this is a woman for whom Madeline Albright is a role model, and Kissinger is an icon, a woman who started out Republican before swapping sides and acting as though she were a Democrat, most likely because she realized that, as a woman, she could go farther as a Democrat. This is a liar who claims to have been dodging sniper fire in a foreign land when she was being greeted with flowers . Throughout the campaign, Clinton supporters have turned a blind eye to her failings. Somehow they were more horrified by what Trump may do than what Clinton already has done. So yeah, we weren¡¯t very excited about a Clinton victory. Nothing would change. America would continue to think itself a progressive democracy that voted in first a black man, and then a woman. The demon would continue to wear a passable face, remain¡­presentable. We do not think Trump is any better, but we think a Trump victory would force the USA to admit to what it has become, and would allow other countries around the world to react appropriately now that the cover has been blown. JFK put on a good mask but behind the mask he was a lying adulterer who lifted the weapons embargo on Israel, allowing the US to supply it with the weapons used against Palestinians. The so-called ¡®Special Relationship¡¯ between the USA and Israel began with JFK. His smile and charm, however, make people, even in the Arab world, look back on him with fondness. Bill Clinton was the same, all charm and smiles while he signed off on the use of military force against Americans on American soil (in Waco), and pushed the Palestinians through Oslo, and then later, in his impeachment hearings, pretended the word ¡®is¡¯ was ambiguous. The Bill Clinton I remember was an arrogant liar and a murderer, not a charming man at all. The latest in this series of supposed good guys is Obama, proudly black, but closer to what Malcolm X referred to as a ¡®house nigger¡¯. Obama did not stop the war machine, and did not close down Guantanamo. Drone usage during Obama¡¯s time has gone up exponentially, but¡­he performs beautifully; he cries when school shootings take place, he laughs at himself with an anger translating sketch, he dances and raps to your pleasure, he seems cool and laid back, a great dad, a fun guy . To tens of thousands of Pakistanis though, Obama is nothing but a cold blooded murderer. To Egyptians he is just another in a long line of US presidents who support a military dictatorship, supplying it with money and weapons. To people in Yemen (the poorest Arab country), he is the man who has helped supply Saudi Arabia (ostensibly the most fascist country on Earth) with more than $100 billion in weapons with which they have destroyed Yemen. To millions of people around the world he is a bomb that happens to have a smile painted on it. And now, finally, rather than suffer the pretense of progress under a female president, America has voted for Trump. Good. Lay bare the racism, lay bare the arrogance, lay bare the lies and the brutalities. Face yourselves, see yourselves, and then maybe, maybe, things will change¡­

The disbelief, shock, and anguish that Donald Trump is now president-elect is giving way to waves of protests. Tens of thousands are hitting the streets in cities large and small, blocking roads, and rejecting Trump¡¯s blatant racism, misogyny, and Islamophobia. 
But Trump is swiftly assembling a cabinet. The names being floated include some of the most dangerous fanatics, demagogues, and authoritarians in America, such as Rudy Giuliani, Sarah Palin, Ben Carson, Newt Gingrich, and Chris Christie. Trump has drawn considerable support for his proposals to deport undocumented immigrants, force Muslims to register with the government , and ban immigration from specific countries. He has allied himself with hardliners opposed to abortion and LGBTQ rights, and his website still includes a call for a ¡°complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.¡± 
Not surprisingly, the targets of these policies are terrified. 
But there is also a chance to create bulwarks of resistance that can minimize much of the harm, while creating space for movements to build power and eventually challenge Trump¡¯s agenda. 
Let¡¯s start in the cities. Cities are places of great diversity, creativity, and tolerance. They are the economic engines of the United States, producing much of the wealth, and where 63 percent of the population lives . Cities are the one place where the left and progressives can exert real power. 
We should start organizing to make cities powerful bastions of noncooperation, resistance, and protection. Activists and organizations can start demanding in every city that city councils and mayors issue resolutions and statements saying: 
1. Our city will not assist or cooperate with any raids or detentions or deportations of any immigrants. This includes assistance of local law enforcement or providing data to the federal government. Already, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray has pledged it will remain a sanctuary city even if Trump cuts off federal funds, as he has vowed to do. 
2. Our city will not cooperate or assist with registration and surveillance programs of Muslims, or any attempts to make our friends, neighbors, and loved ones the enemy. 
3. Our city is a safe zone for all immigrants, Muslims, LGBTQ people, women, and anyone fearing persecution from the Trump regime. 
4. Our cities reject any effort to criminalize or attack Black Lives Matter or other organizing for social justice, as Trump has suggested he might do. 
It¡¯s vital to go beyond nice-sounding but toothless resolutions. This would involve directing city and county attorneys to design legal strategies to resist odious federal policies. It means exerting strong civilian control of police departments, which a Trump administration will try to enlist as front-line troops to persecute entire communities. 
It¡¯s also vital to pass other resolutions and statements asserting unequivocal support for full reproductive health care for women; no attacks on the right to organize or unions; no attacks on workers¡¯ wages, benefits, or health care; and an end to the fossil fuel economy and a rapid and just transition. Complementary strategies can also be developed to make cities more welcoming for LGBT youth and for women denied abortion by creating networks to fund travel and lodging. But it will take organizing to bring local governments on board with such an agenda. 
Many city governments will try to do the minimum and hope protests die down. So there will be a need to organize to get community groups, unions, activist organizations, professional groups, and businesses on board for strong resolutions and action. 
The strategy should be to build a broad-based movement with a focused agenda. In other words, we want as many people on board as possible, but there are also minimum, nonnegotiable demands to protect vulnerable communities. 
Meetings should start happening citywide, in communities and in neighborhoods. Meet with your neighbors, meet with your coworkers. If you¡¯re a student, meet with other students. Wherever possible. 
A lot of horrendous things are going to happen, so we need to resist fiercely and build bastions of noncooperation and protection throughout the country. We have to defeat Trumpism without getting suckered into a failed Democratic Party. 
The world is counting on us.

Devastating for communities of color, immigrants, women, Muslims and queer communities. Devastating for us. Trump has given new voice to deeply rooted white supremacy, gender violence, xenophobia and hatred. Hatred of everything that we are. Hatred of everything that we have struggled against. There are no illusions, we have lived a long time with terror and injustice. But there should be no illusions, that this marks a new phase. A new phase in the development of fascist demagoguery in the belly of the beast. We were not ready to jump on the Clinton bandwagon. Not ready to support her neoliberal agenda at home and promotion of American empire abroad. Not ready to forget her tone-deaf engagement with Black and immigrant organizers and lack of interest in taking action on race. She was not our grandmother and she did not speak for us. But despite her limitations there should be no illusion that we have ended up with the greater of two evils. Trump¡¯s fascism over Clinton¡¯s neoliberalism. We have always resisted. Resisted the lies of the two-party electoral game. Resisted police beatings and murders. Resisted environmental degradation and the evils of corporate polluters. Resisted male violence and transphobia. Resisted the rich bosses and landlords who own the airwaves and politicians. Resistance is our legacy. Resistance is our duty. We have resisted a long time. We will continue to resist. Our goal is transformation. A world where housing is a right and there is a guaranteed living wage for all. A world where neighbors come together to decide the future of their communities and development serves human need, not profit. A world where treaties are honored, where there is self-determination for Native and Black peoples. A world where women, young people and queer folks make decisions about public resources and policies. A world without borders, where we are free to move for health, for love, for work, for family. We want to transform racial divisions between and within our communities of color. We want to transform structures of hetropatriarchy in our families. We want to transform the very nature of our relationships from the individual, to the community, to the societal. This is not about an election or a policy or a political party. Our vision of transformation is deeper and will require not only a change in the system, but a change within ourselves. Our strategy is to organize and build power. We will continue to talk to our neighbors, to those facing evictions and deportations. We will come together in our living rooms and kitchens to share our struggles, articulate vision, strategy and plans. We will take collective action to fight and win locally where we have had the greatest impact in improving lives and conditions. We will build movement. We will engage our differences with respect and honesty. We will connect our humanity and unite around our shared needs and interest. We will build trust and solidarity. Local Organizing Matters A renter movement has emerged in the Bay Area that is as concerned with racial justice as it is with housing justice and this vision is reverberating nationally. Immigrant women are growing a domestic worker movement that is invigorating the labor movement and winning local and state level fights across the country. In Maricopa County, thousands of Latinos organized to oust Joe Arpaio and end 24 years of racist policing. Local organizing matters. Local power matters. Change and transformation will rise up from our neighborhoods and cities, it will not flow down from D.C., the President or the Democrats. The outcomes and impacts of this election are still unfolding. While our assessments and interventions are still in development, one thing is clear. Now more than ever, there is a need for our resistance, our vision of transformation and the hard work of organizing, building power and growing our movement. There was no illusion that things were going to get easier, only the reality that our struggle continues and must become stronger and more effective. Onward.

(Photo: Ministerio de Cultura de la Naci¨®n Argentina) By C.J. Polychroniou / truth-out.org On November 8, 2016, Donald Trump managed to pull the biggest upset in US politics by tapping successfully into the anger of white voters and appealing to the lowest inclinations of people in a manner that would have probably impressed Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels himself. But what exactly does Trump's victory mean, and what can one expect from this megalomaniac when he takes over the reins of power on January 20, 2017? What is Trump's political ideology, if any, and is ""Trumpism"" a movement? Will US foreign policy be any different under a Trump administration? Some years ago, public intellectual Noam Chomsky warned that the political climate in the US was ripe for the rise of an authoritarian figure. Now, he shares his thoughts on the aftermath of this election, the moribund state of the US political system and why Trump is a real threat to the world and the planet in general. C.J. Polychroniou for Truthout: Noam, the unthinkable has happened: In contrast to all forecasts, Donald Trump scored a decisive victory over Hillary Clinton, and the man that Michael Moore described as a ""wretched, ignorant, dangerous part-time clown and full-time sociopath"" will be the next president of the United States. In your view, what were the deciding factors that led American voters to produce the biggest upset in the history of US politics? Noam Chomsky: Before turning to this question, I think it is important to spend a few moments pondering just what happened on November 8, a date that might turn out to be one of the most important in human history, depending on how we react. No exaggeration. The most important news of November 8 was barely noted, a fact of some significance in itself. On November 8, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) delivered a report at the international conference on climate change in Morocco (COP22) which was called in order to carry forward the Paris agreement of COP21. The WMO reported that the past five years were the hottest on record. It reported rising sea levels, soon to increase as a result of the unexpectedly rapid melting of polar ice, most ominously the huge Antarctic glaciers. Already, Arctic sea ice over the past five years is 28 percent below the average of the previous 29 years, not only raising sea levels, but also reducing the cooling effect of polar ice reflection of solar rays, thereby accelerating the grim effects of global warming. The WMO reported further that temperatures are approaching dangerously close to the goal established by COP21, along with other dire reports and forecasts. Another event took place on November 8, which also may turn out to be of unusual historical significance for reasons that, once again, were barely noted. On November 8, the most powerful country in world history, which will set its stamp on what comes next, had an election. The outcome placed total control of the government -- executive, Congress, the Supreme Court -- in the hands of the Republican Party, which has become the most dangerous organization in world history. Apart from the last phrase, all of this is uncontroversial. The last phrase may seem outlandish, even outrageous. But is it? The facts suggest otherwise. The Party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life. There is no historical precedent for such a stand. Is this an exaggeration? Consider what we have just been witnessing. During the Republican primaries, every candidate denied that what is happening is happening -- with the exception of the sensible moderates, like Jeb Bush, who said it's all uncertain, but we don't have to do anything because we're producing more natural gas, thanks to fracking. Or John Kasich, who agreed that global warming is taking place, but added that ""we are going to burn [coal] in Ohio and we are not going to apologize for it."" The winning candidate, now the president-elect, calls for rapid increase in use of fossil fuels, including coal; dismantling of regulations; rejection of help to developing countries that are seeking to move to sustainable energy; and in general, racing to the cliff as fast as possible. Trump has already taken steps to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by placing in charge of the EPA transition a notorious (and proud) climate change denier, Myron Ebell. Trump's top adviser on energy, billionaire oil executive Harold Hamm, announced his expectations, which were predictable: dismantling regulations, tax cuts for the industry (and the wealthy and corporate sector generally), more fossil fuel production, lifting Obama's temporary block on the Dakota Access pipeline. The market reacted quickly. Shares in energy corporations boomed, including the world's largest coal miner, Peabody Energy, which had filed for bankruptcy, but after Trump's victory, registered a 50 percent gain. The effects of Republican denialism had already been felt. There had been hopes that the COP21 Paris agreement would lead to a verifiable treaty, but any such thoughts were abandoned because the Republican Congress would not accept any binding commitments, so what emerged was a voluntary agreement, evidently much weaker. Effects may soon become even more vividly apparent than they already are. In Bangladesh alone, tens of millions are expected to have to flee from low-lying plains in coming years because of sea level rise and more severe weather, creating a migrant crisis that will make today's pale in significance. With considerable justice, Bangladesh's leading climate scientist says that ""These migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming. Millions should be able to go to the United States."" And to the other rich countries that have grown wealthy while bringing about a new geological era, the Anthropocene, marked by radical human transformation of the environment. These catastrophic consequences can only increase, not just in Bangladesh, but in all of South Asia as temperatures, already intolerable for the poor, inexorably rise and the Himalayan glaciers melt, threatening the entire water supply. Already in India, some 300 million people are reported to lack adequate drinking water. And the effects will reach far beyond. It is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history -- whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know -- and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster. Similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human survival: the threat of nuclear destruction, which has been looming over our heads for 70 years and is now increasing. It is no less difficult to find words to capture the utterly astonishing fact that in all of the massive coverage of the electoral extravaganza, none of this receives more than passing mention. At least I am at a loss to find appropriate words. Turning finally to the question raised, to be precise, it appears that Clinton received a slight majority of the vote. The apparent decisive victory has to do with curious features of American politics: among other factors, the Electoral College residue of the founding of the country as an alliance of separate states; the winner-take-all system in each state; the arrangement of congressional districts (sometimes by gerrymandering) to provide greater weight to rural votes (in past elections, and probably this one too, Democrats have had a comfortable margin of victory in the popular vote for the House, but hold a minority of seats); the very high rate of abstention (usually close to half in presidential elections, this one included). Of some significance for the future is the fact that in the age 18-25 range, Clinton won handily, and Sanders had an even higher level of support. How much this matters depends on what kind of future humanity will face. According to current information, Trump broke all records in the support he received from white voters, working class and lower middle class, particularly in the $50,000 to $90,000 income range, rural and suburban, primarily those without college education. These groups share the anger throughout the West at the centrist establishment, revealed as well in the unanticipated Brexit vote and the collapse of centrist parties in continental Europe. [Many of] the angry and disaffected are victims of the neoliberal policies of the past generation, the policies described in congressional testimony by Fed chair Alan Greenspan -- ""St. Alan,"" as he was called reverentially by the economics profession and other admirers until the miraculous economy he was supervising crashed in 2007-2008, threatening to bring the whole world economy down with it. As Greenspan explained during his glory days, his successes in economic management were based substantially on ""growing worker insecurity."" Intimidated working people would not ask for higher wages, benefits and security, but would be satisfied with the stagnating wages and reduced benefits that signal a healthy economy by neoliberal standards. Working people, who have been the subjects of these experiments in economic theory, are not particularly happy about the outcome. They are not, for example, overjoyed at the fact that in 2007, at the peak of the neoliberal miracle, real wages for nonsupervisory workers were lower than they had been years earlier, or that real wages for male workers are about at 1960s levels while spectacular gains have gone to the pockets of a very few at the top, disproportionately a fraction of 1%. Not the result of market forces, achievement or merit, but rather of definite policy decisions, matters reviewed carefully by economist Dean Baker in recently published work . The fate of the minimum wage illustrates what has been happening. Through the periods of high and egalitarian growth in the '50s and '60s, the minimum wage -- which sets a floor for other wages -- tracked productivity. That ended with the onset of neoliberal doctrine. Since then, the minimum wage has stagnated (in real value). Had it continued as before, it would probably be close to $20 per hour. Today, it is considered a political revolution to raise it to $15. With all the talk of near-full employment today, labor force participation remains below the earlier norm. And for working people, there is a great difference between a steady job in manufacturing with union wages and benefits, as in earlier years, and a temporary job with little security in some service profession. Apart from wages, benefits and security, there is a loss of dignity, of hope for the future, of a sense that this is a world in which I belong and play a worthwhile role. The impact is captured well in Arlie Hochschild's sensitive and illuminating portrayal of a Trump stronghold in Louisiana , where she lived and worked for many years. She uses the image of a line in which residents are standing, expecting to move forward steadily as they work hard and keep to all the conventional values. But their position in the line has stalled. Ahead of them, they see people leaping forward, but that does not cause much distress, because it is ""the American way"" for (alleged) merit to be rewarded. What does cause real distress is what is happening behind them. They believe that ""undeserving people"" who do not ""follow the rules"" are being moved in front of them by federal government programs they erroneously see as designed to benefit African-Americans, immigrants and others they often regard with contempt. All of this is exacerbated by [Ronald] Reagan's racist fabrications about ""welfare queens"" (by implication Black) stealing white people's hard-earned money and other fantasies. Sometimes failure to explain, itself a form of contempt, plays a role in fostering hatred of government. I once met a house painter in Boston who had turned bitterly against the ""evil"" government after a Washington bureaucrat who knew nothing about painting organized a meeting of painting contractors to inform them that they could no longer use lead paint -- ""the only kind that works"" -- as they all knew, but the suit didn't understand. That destroyed his small business, compelling him to paint houses on his own with substandard stuff forced on him by government elites. Sometimes there are also some real reasons for these attitudes toward government bureaucracies. Hochschild describes a man whose family and friends are suffering bitterly from the lethal effects of chemical pollution but who despises the government and the ""liberal elites,"" because for him, the EPA means some ignorant guy who tells him he can't fish, but does nothing about the chemical plants. These are just samples of the real lives of Trump supporters, who are led to believe that Trump will do something to remedy their plight, though the merest look at his fiscal and other proposals demonstrates the opposite -- posing a task for activists who hope to fend off the worst and to advance desperately needed changes. Exit polls reveal that the passionate support for Trump was inspired primarily by the belief that he represented change, while Clinton was perceived as the candidate who would perpetuate their distress. The ""change"" that Trump is likely to bring will be harmful or worse, but it is understandable that the consequences are not clear to isolated people in an atomized society lacking the kinds of associations (like unions) that can educate and organize. That is a crucial difference between today's despair and the generally hopeful attitudes of many working people under much greater economic duress during the Great Depression of the 1930s. There are other factors in Trump's success. Comparative studies show that doctrines of white supremacy have had an even more powerful grip on American culture than in South Africa, and it's no secret that the white population is declining. In a decade or two, whites are projected to be a minority of the work force, and not too much later, a minority of the population. The traditional conservative culture is also perceived as under attack by the successes of identity politics, regarded as the province of elites who have only contempt for the ''hard-working, patriotic, church-going [white] Americans with real family values'' who see their familiar country as disappearing before their eyes. One of the difficulties in raising public concern over the very severe threats of global warming is that 40 percent of the US population does not see why it is a problem, since Christ is returning in a few decades. About the same percentage believe that the world was created a few thousand years ago. If science conflicts with the Bible, so much the worse for science. It would be hard to find an analogue in other societies. The Democratic Party abandoned any real concern for working people by the 1970s, and they have therefore been drawn to the ranks of their bitter class enemies, who at least pretend to speak their language -- Reagan's folksy style of making little jokes while eating jelly beans, George W. Bush's carefully cultivated image of a regular guy you could meet in a bar who loved to cut brush on the ranch in 100-degree heat and his probably faked mispronunciations (it's unlikely that he talked like that at Yale), and now Trump, who gives voice to people with legitimate grievances -- people who have lost not just jobs, but also a sense of personal self-worth -- and who rails against the government that they perceive as having undermined their lives (not without reason). One of the great achievements of the doctrinal system has been to divert anger from the corporate sector to the government that implements the programs that the corporate sector designs, such as the highly protectionist corporate/investor rights agreements that are uniformly mis-described as ""free trade agreements"" in the media and commentary. With all its flaws, the government is, to some extent, under popular influence and control, unlike the corporate sector. It is highly advantageous for the business world to foster hatred for pointy-headed government bureaucrats and to drive out of people's minds the subversive idea that the government might become an instrument of popular will, a government of, by and for the people. Is Trump representing a new movement in American politics, or was the outcome of this election primarily a rejection of Hillary Clinton by voters who hate the Clintons and are fed-up with ""politics as usual?"" It's by no means new. Both political parties have moved to the right during the neoliberal period. Today's New Democrats are pretty much what used to be called ""moderate Republicans."" The ""political revolution"" that Bernie Sanders called for, rightly, would not have greatly surprised Dwight Eisenhower. The Republicans have moved so far toward a dedication to the wealthy and the corporate sector that they cannot hope to get votes on their actual programs, and have turned to mobilizing sectors of the population that have always been there, but not as an organized coalitional political force: evangelicals, nativists, racists and the victims of the forms of globalization designed to set working people around the world in competition with one another while protecting the privileged and undermining the legal and other measures that provided working people with some protection, and with ways to influence decision-making in the closely linked public and private sectors, notably with effective labor unions. The consequences have been evident in recent Republican primaries. Every candidate that has emerged from the base -- such as [Michele] Bachmann, [Herman] Cain or [Rick] Santorum -- has been so extreme that the Republican establishment had to use its ample resources to beat them down. The difference in 2016 is that the establishment failed, much to its chagrin, as we have seen. Deservedly or not, Clinton represented the policies that were feared and hated, while Trump was seen as the symbol of ""change"" -- change of what kind requires a careful look at his actual proposals, something largely missing in what reached the public. The campaign itself was remarkable in its avoidance of issues, and media commentary generally complied, keeping to the concept that true ""objectivity"" means reporting accurately what is ""within the beltway,"" but not venturing beyond. Trump said following the outcome of the election that he ""will represent all Americans."" How is he going to do that when the nation is so divided and he has already expressed deep hatred for many groups in the United States, including women and minorities? Do you see any resemblance between Brexit and Donald Trump's victory? There are definite similarities to Brexit, and also to the rise of the ultranationalist far-right parties in Europe -- whose leaders were quick to congratulate Trump on his victory , perceiving him as one of their own: [Nigel] Farage, [Marine] Le Pen, [Viktor] Orban and others like them. And these developments are quite frightening. A look at the polls in Austria and Germany -- Austria and Germany -- cannot fail to evoke unpleasant memories for those familiar with the 1930s, even more so for those who watched directly, as I did as a child. I can still recall listening to Hitler's speeches, not understanding the words, though the tone and audience reaction were chilling enough. The first article that I remember writing was in February 1939, after the fall of Barcelona, on the seemingly inexorable spread of the fascist plague. And by strange coincidence, it was from Barcelona that my wife and I watched the results of the 2016 US presidential election unfold. As to how Trump will handle what he has brought forth -- not created, but brought forth -- we cannot say. Perhaps his most striking characteristic is unpredictability. A lot will depend on the reactions of those appalled by his performance and the visions he has projected, such as they are. Trump has no identifiable political ideology guiding his stance on economic, social and political issues, yet there are clear authoritarian tendencies in his behavior. Therefore, do you find any validity behind the claims that Trump may represent the emergence of ""fascism with a friendly face?"" in the United States? For many years, I have been writing and speaking about the danger of the rise of an honest and charismatic ideologue in the United States, someone who could exploit the fear and anger that has long been boiling in much of the society, and who could direct it away from the actual agents of malaise to vulnerable targets. That could indeed lead to what sociologist Bertram Gross called ""friendly fascism"" in a perceptive study 35 years ago. But that requires an honest ideologue, a Hitler type, not someone whose only detectable ideology is Me. The dangers, however, have been real for many years, perhaps even more so in the light of the forces that Trump has unleashed. With the Republicans in the White House, but also controlling both houses and the future shape of the Supreme Court, what will the US look like for at least the next four years? A good deal depends on his appointments and circle of advisers. Early indications are unattractive, to put it mildly. The Supreme Court will be in the hands of reactionaries for many years, with predictable consequences. If Trump follows through on his Paul Ryan-style fiscal programs, there will be huge benefits for the very rich -- estimated by the Tax Policy Center as a tax cut of over 14 percent for the top 0.1 percent and a substantial cut more generally at the upper end of the income scale, but with virtually no tax relief for others, who will also face major new burdens. The respected economics correspondent of the Financial Times, Martin Wolf, writes that, ""The tax proposals would shower huge benefits on already rich Americans such as Mr Trump,"" while leaving others in the lurch, including, of course, his constituency. The immediate reaction of the business world reveals that Big Pharma, Wall Street, the military industry, energy industries and other such wonderful institutions expect a very bright future. One positive development might be the infrastructure program that Trump has promised while (along with much reporting and commentary) concealing the fact that it is essentially the Obama stimulus program that would have been of great benefit to the economy and to the society generally, but was killed by the Republican Congress on the pretext that it would explode the deficit. While that charge was spurious at the time, given the very low interest rates, it holds in spades for Trump's program, now accompanied by radical tax cuts for the rich and corporate sector and increased Pentagon spending. There is, however, an escape, provided by Dick Cheney when he explained to Bush's Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill that ""Reagan proved that deficits don't matter"" -- meaning deficits that we Republicans create in order to gain popular support, leaving it to someone else, preferably Democrats, to somehow clean up the mess. The technique might work, for a while at least. There are also many questions about foreign policy consequences, mostly unanswered. There is mutual admiration between Trump and Putin. How likely is it therefore that we may see a new era in US-Russia relations? One hopeful prospect is that there might be reduction of the very dangerous and mounting tensions at the Russian border: note ""the Russian border,"" not the Mexican border. Thereby lies a tale that we cannot go into here. It is also possible that Europe might distance itself from Trump's America, as already suggested by [German] Chancellor [Angela] Merkel and other European leaders -- and from the British voice of American power, after Brexit. That might possibly lead to European efforts to defuse the tensions, and perhaps even efforts to move towards something like Mikhail Gorbachev's vision of an integrated Eurasian security system without military alliances, rejected by the US in favor of NATO expansion, a vision revived recently by Putin, whether seriously or not, we do not know, since the gesture was dismissed. Is US foreign policy under a Trump administration likely to be more or less militaristic than what we have seen under the Obama administration, or even the George W. Bush administration? I don't think one can answer with any confidence. Trump is too unpredictable. There are too many open questions. What we can say is that popular mobilization and activism, properly organized and conducted, can make a large difference. And we should bear in mind that the stakes are very large.

As John Oliver correctly pointed out Sunday night, folks are being fed what they want to hear and they¡¯re eating it up like a starving person. The most important thing in a functional society is a well-informed public. What we have now is not only uninformed but misinformed masses. That¡¯s something that should scare us all. The most important thing in a functional society is a well-informed public. What we have now is not only uninformed but misinformed masses. 
How do we combat this problem? Easy, we have to do some work. While I could give a long dissertation on what exactly that means, no one has the patience to read it all, so here are five quick steps that¡¯ll fit in a meme¡­ 
1. Read first. Then share. I myself am guilty of basing comments or even clicking share based on the headline. This is the worst thing any of us could do. Stop being lazy. 
2. Check the source (and their sources). In the age of new media true and valid information comes from non-traditional sources but so does a lot of garbage. Any article that posts facts, figures or quotes should provide a source for that information. If there is no backup for their claims, move on. 
3. Watch out for recycled stories. One thing that seems to be feeding into the misinformation problem is when old stories are being presented as happening now. Check the date on the story before you read on. You¡¯ll be shocked to see how many are from another time and aren¡¯t applicable to the current event you thought they were talking about. 
4. If you care about facts, ignore the blatantly slanted. Having a slant or taking a position on a story is not wrong in itself. What is wrong is when these ideas are taken as unbiased fact. You can avoid all of this by simply avoiding those sites to start with. Any website with the words: Conservative, Liberal, Democrat, Republican, etc. in the title are just advertising how slanted they are. That¡¯s ok if you choose to live in your side¡¯s bubble but please don¡¯t have any delusions that these stories reflect the whole picture. 
5. Google it. God (and Sergey ) gave us Google for a reason. If you see a story that¡¯s unbelievable or has no sources or even if it does, verify. See if the same facts are reported across multiple outlets. See if anyone disputes these facts. Read these pieces and then make up your mind. 
If we could all take these simple steps our society would be a better place. We all have opinions and leanings. There is nothing wrong with that but could we at least all come from a starting point based on facts and reality? 
The truth is, sharing illogical things begins to erode YOUR credibility and it makes you look foolish. Trust me, I speak from experience.

The reckoning is here for progressives and the Democratic Party now that the unthinkable has happened. Most of America, shell-shocked, is asking how Hillary Clinton and the entire Democratic establishment could lose to a woman-bashing, Mexican-deporting, Muslim-hating, white-supremacist-embracing charlatan? 
Simple. Trump captured the historical mood with his message of white nationalism and economic populism. Then he threaded an electoral college needle against an atrocious candidate. Clinton has a lead in the roughly 120 million votes cast for the two major-party candidates, while Trump essentially won with some 107,000 votes. That¡¯s his combined margin in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. 
Clinton failed to defend firewall states like Michigan and Wisconsin, devoting huge resources to insurance states like Florida and Ohio. But here is why she really lost: Clinton had close to 9 million fewer votes than Barack Obama did in 2008, and roughly 5 million fewer votes than he did in 2012. There¡¯s no getting around the fact that much of the Democratic base repudiated Clinton. 
It is tempting to say Trump won because of FBI Director James Comey¡¯s outrageous letter 11 days before the election that re-opened the email investigation. Nate Silver, one of the few forecasters who gave Trump a significant chance of winning, suggested Comey may have cost Clinton up to 3 points . That additional margin could have helped hand Clinton a decisive win. And if that happened, there would be no soul searching about an angry white revolt against elites. 
But Comey never told Clinton to set up a private email server. Just like WikiLeaks never told Clinton to deliver secret speeches to investment banks. ¡°Crooked Hillary¡± stuck because of the Clintons¡¯ own doings: the emails, their foundation, $22 million in speaking fees, two-faced policy positions. The primaries were a flashing red light warning of these troubles. Bernie Sanders posed a serious challenge to Clinton despite her backing by the entire party establishment. Even then, if she had tapped Sanders to be her running mate, she might have won because of his appeal among millennials. 
But instead of tending to the Democratic base demanding single-payer health care, a Green New Deal and free higher education, Clinton veered right with a Democratic National Convention espousing militarism, American exceptionalism and God. This strategy blew up in Clinton¡¯s face. More Democrats voted for Trump than Republicans voted for Clinton . 
Plus, Clinton would never pick a social democrat like Sanders because she is neoliberal to the bone. During the 1990s the Clintons erected much of the scaffolding of neoliberalism with NAFTA, the repeal of Glass-Steagall , the Commodity Futures Modernization Act , the media-monopoly-creating Telecommunications Act , ending welfare and passing laws for the mass deportation of immigrants. 
The Clintons kicked off a run during which Democrats have owned the White House for 16 of the last 24 years. Instead of countering the Republicans, they have battered the working class¡ªwhite, brown, Black¡ªwho watched as businesses shuttered and communities shriveled. Obama failed to help workers in a meaningful way despite his resounding mandate. He spent his political capital to save Wall Street and design a health care system more beneficial to the for-profit industry than its patients. 
Meanwhile, millions lost their homes, sank into joblessness and descended into poverty. People of color generally realize the Republicans were much more hostile to their interests so they stick with the Democrats. But white workers outside a shrinking labor movement didn¡¯t see either party as particularly hospitable to their interests. 
That gave Trump an opening. He radically transformed the GOP in a year, turning it into an anti-free trade and anti-interventionist party reluctant to cut retirement programs. His trick was to stoke the right¡¯s racism and misogyny, which is now being portrayed as a regular Joe backlash against arrogant coastal elites. 
The racism directed toward Obama helped to form Trump¡¯s foundation, especially the Tea Party and birtherism. But Trumpism is a fluid identity. Obama won Indiana in 2008, a state that was about 84 percent white then, and performed better among nearly every subgroup of whites in his two victories than Clinton did in 2016 . In fact, according to The New York Times¡¯ Nate Cohn , ¡°Clinton suffered her biggest losses in the places where Obama was strongest among white voters. It's not a simple racism story.¡± 
That is true. It is racism, but it¡¯s not simple. Trump took workers¡¯ social and economic ills produced as much by Democrats as by Republicans, and he fed them through a racial grinder to make his alt-white sausage. He created an identity that a majority of the white working class and middle class flocked to. It is racist, but it¡¯s not fixed. And much of this failure to retain a majority of the white working class in the Democratic Party lays with organized labor, which does little organizing beyond get-out-the-vote and contract negotiation campaigns. 
Unions have the resources to painstakingly win workers of all stripes over to social-democratic policies. But for that to happen, organized left forces need to push labor hard. As shown by WikiLeaks , many prominent labor leaders suck up to pro-Wall Street Democrats and sideline policies that would show workers government can be a force for good, and not fear, in their lives. And in this election, Clinton held a slim 8-point advantage among voters from a union household. In Ohio, CNN exit polls showed Clinton losing union households by a 12-point margin , a larger margin than she lost non-union households. This is a clear lesson to unions that they have not been listening to their members. 
Trump¡¯s victory is a declaration of a social civil war. We know what many of these battles will be, and it¡¯s going to be a dark four years. But just as the Republican Party has been upended, so have the Democrats. The task ahead is to defend those communities and people most at risk from Trumpism, build power where the left does have real potential¡ªcities of all sizes and deep-blue states¡ªand focus on organizing principled, inclusive radical movements that can shift the entire political terrain rather than uselessly pouring energy into the black hole of the Democratic Party.

In the ten days since the election, several thousand people have phoned and emailed my Seattle City Council office in their fury over my call to shut down Donald Trump¡¯s agenda with massive peaceful protests on Inauguration Day. 
Many messages were from middle- and working-class people who had voted for Trump because they hated corporate Democrats and Hillary Clinton, and mistakenly believed that Trump was going to stand up for the ordinary Americans. Many were also racist and misogynist, saying things like, ¡°You don¡¯t belong here with the bull***t you spew from your c***su**er,¡± or ¡°Drop dead and go back to turbanville.¡± 
Call after call, while having zero tolerance for bigotry and threats, my staff patiently explained to the more reasonable Trump supporters that we agree working people have been sold out by corporate politicians. That we completely oppose the bipartisan, big business policies of ¡°free trade¡± deals like the TPP and NAFTA, corporate tax handouts, and the close ties of both parties to Wall Street. Callers were surprised to learn that while I fiercely oppose Trump, I did not back Hillary Clinton (I campaigned for Bernie Sanders, and later Jill Stein). Many were simply not reachable, as they spewed hate on all those protesting their president-elect. They will have to experience Donald Trump¡¯s policies in office to see him for what he is: a con man and representative of the billionaire class who sold the lie that he will bring back the American Dream. 
My first grim thoughts as I saw some of the horrifying emails was that I will be far from the only person targeted after the dangerous rise of Donald Trump. Bigots are feeling emboldened. Already a surge in bullying and hate crimes has taken place, and the KKK felt confident to hold a rally in North Carolina to celebrate Trump¡¯s victory. 
Disconcerting in a different way have been the hit pieces in local publications like The Seattle Times and The Stranger attacking me and other Stein supporters, and trying to shift blame for the outcome of the presidential election. The Stranger article even went so far as to say that since I didn¡¯t support Clinton, I should not continue to call protests against Trump: that this would be ¡°poor form.¡± 
But as everyone from prominent Clinton surrogate Robert Reich to the New York Times have more or less acknowledged, in failing to defeat the most unpopular major party candidate in modern American history, the Democrats have no one to blame but themselves. The NY Times editorial board questioned the disastrous strategy of attempting a ¡°Clinton restoration at a moment when the nation was impatient to escape the status quo,¡± while Reich called for a ¡°new Democratic Party,¡± and said the election served as a ¡°repudiation of the American power structure, including the old Democratic Party.¡± 
At every stage of the Democratic Primary, the DNC and party leadership fiercely opposed Bernie Sanders and backed Clinton to the hilt. In the general election, Clinton could have reached out to young and working class Sanders supporters instead of arrogantly assuming she didn¡¯t need them. By choosing to tell the millions of people who have been sold out and disenfranchised by neoliberal policies over several decades that America is ¡°already great,¡± Clinton received several millions fewer votes than Obama in 2012, including fewer votes from women. 
Now, having assisted Trump¡¯s ascension to the White House, Clinton and this same Democratic Party leadership tell us we should ¡°give him a chance.¡± But make no mistake, Trump¡¯s success is not ¡°our success,¡± in spite of Obama¡¯s comments to that effect. And while we would be happy to be surprised by any progressive measures from a Trump administration, we simply have no time to waste in building an organized opposition against the damage he has already vowed to do, including his promise to deport three million immigrants. 
We must bring together millions of progressive workers and young people to build a wall of mass resistance against Trump, and to defend immigrants, women, Muslims, LGBTQ people and all others targeted by his presidency. 
Hundreds of thousands of people have already poured into the streets since November 8th. On the night of the election result, my organization, Socialist Alternative began to organize protests around the country for the next day. More than 50,000 answered that call: in Seattle, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Oakland. Many more protests have followed, as well as dozens of student walkouts, including 5,000 Seattle students on Monday alone. 
Our movement will need to be independent of both major political parties. The Democratic Party cannot be relied on to stop Trump, anymore now than during the election. And to truly defeat the right, we will need to build our own mass party ¨C a party of, by and for the 99% ¨C completely free of corporate cash and corporate influence. 
We have a historic responsibility to fight back against this administration. On January 20th and 21st, activists will be organizing protests and student walkouts across the country. Hundreds of thousands will gather for the Women¡¯s March on Washington DC and to ¡°Occupy Inauguration,¡± to send a message to the new president that there is no space whatsoever for his bigoted agenda in America. 
I hope you will join us.

For the first time since the Cold War, the ¡°Russian question¡± has become an important part of the debates between US presidential candidates. In turn, Russia is highly interested in a favorable outcome of the elections in the United States. In Russia itself, discussion has long been raging over which one of the US presidential candidates is better for Russia¡¯s interests: Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?  
Russian society¡¯s sympathy undoubtedly belongs to Donald Trump, as Clinton has a high disapproval rating given her personal qualities and approach to Russia. If she is elected president of the United States, then she will likely become the most unpopular head of the White House in Russian public opinion. 
The ¡°Russian question¡± is part of a more global question of the new world system in which the US is losing its status as the world¡¯s sole superpower. Russia is playing an important role in changing the American Empire¡¯s status, perhaps even a leading one. But the American crisis is even more comprehensive and goes far beyond Russia¡¯s influence. A Russia dreaming of returning its former imperial greatness is less to blame for the fall of the US¡¯ imperial influence than the irrationality of the American elites themselves.  
Russia survived two collapses in the 20th century consequential of internal factors.  The two Russian revolutions of the 20th century (1917 and 1991) were the result of a low quality of the ruling class and the undermining of their authority in society. The external factor was important, but still only a subsidiary cause of the collapse of the government and society. I believe that America is facing a similar crisis.  
As the author of these lines was told 10 years ago by an astute and recognized scholar, a former citizen of the USSR who emigrated to the US in the early 1990¡¯s, America is today undergoing the same wrenching transformations that the Soviet Union experienced in the Perestroika period. This scholar¡¯s view of the future of his new homeland was exclusively pessimistic - he believed that the US would not cope with its own restructuring primarily because of the unsuitability of its own elites. 
Of course, my opinion as a person who knows little of America and the opinion of the more knowledgeable above-mention citizen are only personal ones. But the emergence of the phenomenon of Donald Trump is not a detail, but an objective consequences of the deep crisis of the American system.  
The Trump phenomenon demonstrates at least two critical factors: (1) the complete alienation of the American elites (or as the Czech communist ideologist Dr. Skala says, the American ¡®nomenklatura¡¯) from the people, and (2) the American nomenklatura¡¯s complete loss of touch with reality. Both are painfully reminiscent of the situation in the USSR before Perestroika.  
The late Soviet elites (the ¡®nomenklatura,¡¯ as they were pejoratively called in society) turned into a closed caste. Even though, in my opinion, they were still more democratic than the current American elite, the Soviet nomenklatura sacrificed the interests of real modernization of the country¡¯s social-economic system and ideology for the sake of pursuing geopolitical phantoms. Perhaps I am wrong, but such ""false idols"" prevail in the minds of the current American nomenklatura even more.  
In the US, factories are closing, migration is growing, Mexico is slowly realizing a Reconquista (the return of their lands in the southwestern states of the US that were annexed as a result of an unjust war), and all of this is happening against the backdrop of imperial overstretch. The US is striving to control not only its backyard, Latin America (which is being actively penetrated by Chinese capital, another manifestation of the phantom thinking of the American nomenklatura), but also Ukraine, for which Russia is ready to fight to the last breath.  
America does not have the strength for this. But the American nomenklatura does not have the slightest interest in taking care of things at home and concentrating on domestic issues. Continuing American expansion is akin to Trotsky¡¯s permanent revolution. Such is intriguing and vivid, while home repairs and cleaning toilets is infinitely boring and tedious. 
This is why the US presidential elections will be won by the political lunatic and American Trotskyist, Hillary Clinton, who does not strive for realism or call for cleaning the Augean stables like Donald Trump does. 

Obviously, for Russia it is better to deal with a US government which defends its own national interests, not phantoms of pseudo-democracy and its declining imperial power. But little depends on Russia¡¯s opinion. Therefore, it is advisable to prepare for and objectively observe the course of the fight whose outcome is practically a foregone conclusion.

On November 8th, Republican candidate Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States. The results of the elections are still being summed up, but Trump has the undisputed advantage in electoral votes - 279 against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton¡¯s 218 - and has therefore practically won.  
Russian political circles are displaying a cautious attitude towards Donald Trump¡¯s victory in the US presidential elections. Politicians interviewed by RT expect that Russia and America will build more constructive relations, but no warming should be counted on. Russian deputies and senators have noted that they are awaiting a ¡°competent¡± reaction by Trump to Syria, Crimea, and Ukraine. 
The deputy chairman of the Federation Council¡¯s Committee on International Affairs, Arsen Kanokov, expects Trump to find a common language with Vladimir Putin and Russia overall. The senator said: ¡°There is great hope for a thaw. We all want to have friendly relations with America. The question is how these processes are happening. I think that we will sit at the negotiating table and Russia¡¯s reasonable voice will be heard by America. We hope that they will understand the actions and aid that we are affording to Syria. The political vector will change in this regard.¡± 
The first deputy chairwoman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Svetlana Zhurova, recalled that Donald Trump repeatedly spoke of the need for cooperation with Russia even during his election campaign.  
Zhurova believes: ¡°This does not mean that tomorrow Trump will rush to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin or that our representatives will rush to America to negotiate with him. They will work out orderly, constructive relations. Trump will pay more attention to internal problems rather than the showdown between the two countries. He believes that America should pay attention to economic cooperation with Russia, political dialogue, and the joint struggle against global terrorism. In these spheres, our countries can truly be useful for each other. Trump spoke about all of this in his campaign speeches. He is not the kind of person who breaks his word. Yes, Trump will look to the opinion of the US population, which has some doubts concerning Russia, but there won¡¯t be such aggression in policies towards Russia like the Obama administration did.¡± 
Dmitry Novikov, also a member of the State Duma¡¯s international committee, suggests that no radical changes in the US' foreign policy course should be expected.  
¡°Trump has been elected president of his country, so he will undoubtedly defend the interests of the US and its ruling circles. If Trump will fulfill his promises on how the administration in Washington should focus on solving domestic problems, then maybe his foreign policy won¡¯t be so aggressive. As for what concerns Russia, more common sense approaches to such issues as Syria, Crimea, and Ukraine might prevail in the White House¡¯s policies. In these cases, the preconditions for the normalization of relations between Russia and the United States could be expressed,¡± Novikov posited. 
Novikov also added that no warming of relations like in the days of Kennedy and Khrushchev should be expected, since Russia¡¯s geopolitical position has dramatically changed.  
¡°The Soviet Union had much more formidable starting capabilities to be on an equal footing in the world arena. The country had economic weight and a system of alliances. In this sense, modern Russia has a somewhat weaker position. Nevertheless, the US has enough domestic problems, and if Trump really zeros in on solving them, then we could see more reasonable foreign policy,¡± he added. 
In turn, the first deputy chairman of the Federation Council¡¯s Committee on International Affairs, Vladimir Dzhabarov, believes that Trump¡¯s victory will positively impact Russian-American relations. According to him: ¡°One shouldn't wait for any dramatic warming [in relations], or worsening, for that matter, which was expected if Hillary won.¡± Dzhabarov remarked that Trump, during his election campaign, behaved with dignity and did not spew out any negative statements towards Russia and the Russian president. 

The politician also expressed hope that the billionaire¡¯s victory would affect Europe¡¯s position on relations with Russia: ¡°No wonder they have taken a cautious position on sanctions. I hope that they will become more independent,¡± Dzhabarov said.

Among the epithets sprinkled on the Republican candidate and new US President were ¡°dangerous marginal,"" ""complete idiot,"" and ¡°clown.¡± If Arseniy Yatsenyuk, having already left Ukrainian Olympus, might not threatened by the consequences of destructively criticizing the new US president, then the acting head of Ukraine¡¯s Ministry of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov, will have to explain the words he wrote on Facebook as well as the accompanying picture. ""US presidential candidate Trump's shameless statement on the possibility of recognizing Crimea as Russian is a diagnosis of a dangerous marginal. He is just as dangerous for Ukraine as he is for the US. A marginal indulging Putin's dictatorship cannot be a guarantor of democratic freedoms in the US and the world..No wonder Manafort earlier headed Yanukovych's headquarters, and now Trump's. Yanukovich fled to Russia through Crimea. Where will Manafort take Trump? #Trumpisours"" Besides the ex-prime minister and head of the Ukrainian interior ministry, deputies of the Verkhovna Rada, diplomats, and other officials have bad mouthed Trump.

On November 9th, despite the overwhelming majority of forecasts, the eccentric billionaire Donald Trump won the US presidential elections, not the favorite of the American elites, Hillary Clinton.  
But Trump¡¯s joy is not shared by everyone. Many American citizens don¡¯t consider him to be their president. A wave of demonstrations and protests has swept across America which are becoming stronger with each passing day. Today, November 11th, it was reported that a petition to the electors to recognize Hillary Clinton¡¯s victory has already gathered 2 million signatures (over two, not even whole days!)  
The situation unfolding today in the US is in some of its features reminiscent of the situation n Ukraine during the first ¡°Orange Revolution¡± of 2004. Ukraine was split into two camps along geographic lines: the South and East were for the winner of the second round of elections, Viktor Yanukovych, and the West and Center were for Viktor Yushchenko, the leader of the liberal opposition. Of course, this comparison might be somewhat arbitrary, but what ties together the present situation in the US and Ukraine in 2004 is that Ukrainian and American society turned out to be split.  
In the US, according to published statistics, 70% of the white population voted for Donald Trump along with most Protestants and slightly more than half of Catholics. For Hillary Clinton voted racial minorities - 88% of African Americans and 65% of people of Latin American origin. Clinton was also supported by religious minorities, such as Jews, Muslims, and atheists, sexual minorities, and supporters of ¡°cultural revolution,¡± i.e., the intelligentsia living in the big cities. This is at least how the picture looks from Russia.  
I will posit that Yanukovych¡¯s victory in the second round of elections and Trump¡¯s victory divided their nations insofar as the elections were polarized along the positions of citizens (whether geographical, racial, or cultural). The second, losing half of the population felt deceived and betrayed. In Ukraine, the situation was then transformed into the exact opposite: as a result of an unconstitutional ¡°third round¡± of elections, the president¡¯s victory was handed over to Western Ukraine¡¯s candidate, Yushchenko. Then it was the South and East that felt betrayed.  
Larger and larger masses of people in the US are protesting. I think that these protests will subside and won¡¯t lead to anything big.  But the cultural-civilizational and racial split, not receiving any political solution, will only become deeper and create the basis for a genuine split of the nation. Something similar already happened in US history, when there was the split into the Federalist North and Confederate South. But now the situation seems much more complex and the contradictions are far more varied and not restricted to geographical borders. 
Ironically, the first signs of a color revolution can be observed in the US - in the likes of all of such that the US has engineered in different countries. On social networks, the hashtag #Calexit is gaining popularity among California residents. This is a call to proclaim the independence of California and its secession from the US by analogy with Brexit in the UK. 
Individual states in the US have talked about separatism before, but only now is separatism gaining a broad social basis after the presidential elections split American society into two maps: the white population, and racial and religious minorities including the supporters of multiculturalism. 
But what has particularly struck me personally in the current situation surrounding the elections results is the reaction to Trump¡¯s victory among EU leaders. It is a paradox that such a junior partner (if not vassal) of the US, the European Union, dares to criticize the will of the American people, and even support protests against Trump, i.e., a potential color revolution in the US! One Russian newspaper quoted an anonymous member of the European Parliament according to whom the destructive effect of the outcome of the elections has 10 times surpassed the aftermath of the referendum on Great Britain¡¯s exit from the EU. Judging by everything, this is not only the personal opinion of one European MEP. This is the assessment of the overwhelming majority of the European political mainstream. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, who perhaps might be the future Chancellor of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has urged the EU to prepare for Trump¡¯s ¡°unpredictable¡± foreign policy. The head of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, did not refrain from expressing himself when he compared Trump¡¯s victory to Brexit. In his opinion, people turn to ""protest voting"" when they are not taken seriously. Thus, one of the leaders of the European Union supports a color revolution in the US! 

Multicultural Europe is standing in support of the multicultural US. How far will the protests in America go and how far will European politicians go in supporting a color revolution in the US? In my opinion, the process is much more important than the result. The country is split, just like the Western elites themselves¡­

November 12, 2016 - Fort Russ 

Neyromir TV (Video)  - Valentin Katasonov - Translated from Russian by Kristina Kharlova 


The heated discussion in the media is a diversion - focused on marginal issues appealing to emotions, while much graver issues that are at stake are hidden behind the scenes, explains Valentin Katasonov, p rofessor, associate member of the Russian Academy of Economic Science and Business. 




Part 1 (00.00-14.00) 





V.K: Trump understands the situation. I didn't expect him to be so open about revealing all the ills. He is revealing many of the secrets. This is better for America - to face the diagnosis, than to conceal it from  the patient.  

As you know interest rates in the countries of the Golden billion are below the floor.  Last year when interest rates were slightly raised, this caused serious consequences . Christine Lagarde appealed to stop or the global economy will crash. They did not raise interest rates again as planned. Not in the first or the second quarter. They are in a very difficult situation. Trump said if interest rates are raised America will default, because most of the budget will go to pay for interest rates.  

Trump probably wants to save capitalism, but capitalism without interest rates is nonsense. Trump  is a defender of capitalism. 

Host: Who is Hillary Clinton? 

V.K.: She doesn't say who she is, she is focused on some marginal subjects, like rights of minorities or climate change. We understand that these are silly games. 

Host: But climate change is real? 

V.K.: You know I was involved in this as part of World Bank and I know their schemes. Although there might be something going on, I can assure that they don't really care about it.  

Host: What about the ruble? 

V.K. It depends when this apocalypse will take place. The dropping of the ruble is part of the plan of the occupation. 

Only God knows when this apocalypse will happen, may be not next week, could be few months of years for sure, because all the resources have been exhausted. Trump senses this very well, and he wants to save capitalism and America, and for this he wants to negotiate with the lenders and restructure American debt. In reality America is working on new technologies which don't require any negotiations, I am taking about Iran. As you know in the beginning of 2o16 Uncle Sam said we are finally cancelling sanctions and unfreeze Iran's foreign assets. 

There are many conditions, some things are written down. Iran is not happy that America is writing off $2 billion to cover losses from terrorist act in Lebanon in 1983. I looked at some documents, Iran had nothing to do with it, but Uncle Sam found them guilty, just like those in 9/11. It turns out the culprit was Saudi Arabia.  

Host: But Saudi Arabia threatened to sell treasuries and was taken off the list of culprits? 

V.K. Who will let them sell it? Treasuries are in the depositories, it's a double key system, Saudi Arabia has one key and Uncle Sam has another key 

Host: Why is Russia buying these treasuries while in a crisis? We did mention this is a levy, but if we don't develop our industry and science nothing will help us? 

V.K. You know some of our elites hope they have an second base in the USA, the 'unsinkable'. We know some people have already set up base there, like the first deputy minister of finance. Some are closer, like the former minister of agriculture is in France. It is easier to count those who did not leave. This shows we are dealing with colonial administration which receives basic guarantees for citizenship in the US, France, GB. 

Host: Their policies lead to total collapse, what if the owners are not happy? 

V.K.: You know, lets not overestimate the masters, they act as parasites. Parsites keep feeding not thinking that the food will run out and they may also perish. They don't see beyond their nose. 

Speaking of Iran, according to Iran, their foreign reserves comprise $130 billion, according to US - $100 billion, half of them are gold and currency reserves belonging to Iran's Central bank, or the Sovereign fund of Iran. I think they will eat up these 130 billion very fast, because after the $2 billion, US announced they will demand $11.5 billion for 9/11. The appetite comes during the meal. The Iranian parliament discussed a bill to allow the government to begin a case about damages to Iran by USA. A working group will inventory all the events and estimate them.  

Today the world is entering a repatriation game, this is a commercialization of international relations and monetizing of our history. This is very important to Russian Federation. Baltic countries continue to work on such demands, especially Latvia. Ukraine is a little different. While the Baltics refer to Soviet occupation, Ukraine is talking about Crimea. Monetizing losses from events in Donbass and so on. I am just saying we should be a step ahead, we must prepare the same contra-measures. 



Don't get caught up in the media's agenda, dig deeper and think with your own head! - KK

On her Facebook page, Verkhovna Rada deputy Nadezhda Savchenko urged future US President Donald Trump to maintain and strengthen sanctions against Russia. In fact, she foreshadowed similar, official calls of the sort from Kiev to the new US administration.  
Such calls will necessarily follow insofar as the entire foreign policy of the Kiev regime is based on simple-minded and destructive assumptions: lobbying the West for extending anti-Russian sanctions and begging for aid and loans.  
However, likely changes in US foreign policy under Trump, including in relations with the Kiev regime, as well as internal political processes in Ukraine itself could seriously change both the relationship between Kiev and Washington and the balance of political forces within the Kiev regime.  
Overall, the situation in Ukraine is developing in the direction of early parliamentary elections with the possibility of nominating the now former head of the Odessa regional administration, Mikhail Saakashvili, for president in 2019. 
The US itself long ago formulated the clear demand for a new, distinctly pro-American oriented political force that could replace the Maidan politicians of the first wave. Washington, in the face of the departing Obama Administration, has finally refused to trust Poroshenko, Yatsenyuk, Avakov, and their entourage. 
Donald Trump, on the basis of his foreign policy ideas, will most likely significantly reduce the US¡¯ active participation in ideologically-driven foreign policy actions like the Obama Administration¡¯s policy in Ukraine.  
During his election campaign, Trump promised to transition US foreign policy to ""breaking even"" and threatened to stimulate America¡¯s European allies to take greater responsibility for Ukraine upon themselves.  
In this situation, the number of those in Ukraine who want to show that replacing the corrupt government of Poroshenko and the People¡¯s Front with a new pro-American government will allow the West to economize on aid to Ukraine is increasing. Trump¡¯s foreign policy positions paradoxically give Saakashvili and the pro-American groups oriented towards him in Kiev an additional argument for the new administration and a powerful lever of pressure on Poroshenko and his entourage. We will soon see how Trump will react to these arguments. 
In addition to Saakashvili and his Volna (""Wave"") party, the ¡°Leshchenko-Nayem group¡± is trying to become the new pro-Western bet in Ukraine. This group makes up the core of the Democratic Alliance party and a large mass of the pro-Western oriented public opinion leaders and influential officials in Kiev and in the regions. 
Washington¡¯s unwillingness to destabilize the overall socio-political situation in Ukraine to such an extent that it would spin out of the US¡¯ control is, like before, hindering the Americans from removing Poroshenko from the post of president. Poroshenko remains, but in such a situation, the role and importance of those pro-American oriented political forces who will start keeping a close eye on the corrupt team of the head of the Kiev regime will only grow. 
Washington¡¯s claims against Kiev, duplicated by the American column in Ukraine, concern the lack of professionalism in the state administration, the indulgence of corruption, the use of grey financial schemes in the economy, robbing the budget, the misuse of foreign loans, etc.  
At the present moment, the anti-Poroshenko and pro-American forces in Ukrainian politics remain fragmented, but they now understand the necessity of unifying.  
The problem is that the ¡°young reformers¡± that the Obama Administrated hedged its bets in Ukraine on, just like the third pro-American forces (besides the Poroshenko Bloc and People¡¯s Front) have turned out to be at loggerheads with the future US president, Trump.  
Deputies Sergey Leshchenko and Mustafa Nayem are favorites of Joe Biden and Victoria Nuland who openly played along with Hillary Clinton¡¯s election campaign. Leshchenko personally initiated the ""off-the-books"" scandal with the Party of Regions which forced Paul Manafort, the head of Trump¡¯s election headquarters, to leave his post. The only chance for them now is to escape to Saakashvili¡¯s patronage, who will be the only one in the Kiev regime that didn¡¯t play in any anti-Trump campaign. 
Saakashvilli and his party, just like the Democratic Alliance, Yulia Tymoshenko¡¯s Fatherland party, and the Opposition Bloc, are interested in early parliamentary elections and are likely to promote them. Saakashvili¡¯s resignation, urgent party building, and the convulsive social and political activity of Poroshenko¡¯s opponents show that no one in the opposition wants to wait until 2019. And so, a congress of the Democratic Alliance party is being prepared which will finally determine a program and elect a leadership. Someone is also trying to organize Volna.  
Whether the Trump Administration will give a green light to early parliamentary elections is unknown. However, Poroshenko¡¯s competitors are obviously counting on their activism to influence the Trump Administration¡¯s position and put the need to support such choices in front of it.  

In one way or another, some of Poroshenko¡¯s competitors have perceived the change of government in the US not only as a challenge, but as a window of opportunity for themselves. Taking into account this factor, the development of events in Ukraine increases the likelihood of a change in the balance of political forces and early parliamentary elections.

Arnoldski - Perhaps the most famous media project of Donald Trump is the reality show ¡°The Apprentice¡± on NBC, in which Trump played himself and subjected people wanting to work in his business to various tests. Trump not only played the lead role in the show, but also successfully produced it, which proves that he can not only built hotels, but also very well understands modern show business. This also shows how his opponents greatly underestimated him during the presidential race. Before Trump launched his presidential slogan ¡°Make America Great Again,¡± in the public¡¯s mind he was already associated with another catchphrase: ¡°You¡¯re fired!¡±, which he yelled at the careless participants of his TV show. Some American commentators have even written that voters might have voted for him just to see whether he would dress down Washington officials in the same way he did on TV. So far, at least in front of cameras, Trump is behaving relatively restrained, especially since he has no official rights yet. But the press is already leaking information about what he is doing behind closed doors. For example, USA Today , a newspaper which is very skeptical towards the new president, reports that Trump¡¯s first victims are Pentagon generals. He has set before them the unspoken task of working out a plan for mass, effective airstrikes on ISIS. The due date is in 30 days and will have unpredictable, negative consequences for those generals who will not fulfill the order or will handle it poorly. The sources of American journalists are even complaining that these generals could be forced to - get ready - cooperate with Russia and even share information with the Russian air force, something which for many senior US commanders is worse than having to shred their insignia. Now let me explain why this plan for ¡°massive bombardments against ISIS¡± is important. Remember what our diplomats and officers constantly say about the US¡¯ actions - the Americans have only been supposedly bombing ISIS for several years, and the number of flights is scanty and their successes feature, for example, only two killed ISIS leaders. It is clear these bombardments were carried out in such a way so as to not harm the terrorist groups sponsored by Qatar and Saudi Arabia and those groups whom Clinton considered to be the main tool in the fight against Assad. And now it turns out that Trump is already going to force the American military machine, under threat of dismissals, to really bomb their yesterday allies. Obama has oriented himself in this situation best of all, since he might need to be given a consolation prize for being the most quirky American politician. After three years of inactivity and after his peace deal with Putin that Clinton¡¯s supporters (the same ¡°forces in Washington¡± that Putin spoke about at Valdai) tore up, the departing American president has decided to indulge this opportunity to the fullest. Here¡¯s what American media are writing today. The Washington Post , citing senior officials in the outgoing administration, writes that Barack Obama has ordered to find and destroy leaders of the terrorist group Jebhat Al-Nusra. Although it is better to wait for official statements, it can be assumed that this information is accurate since the Washington Post is a newspaper with good sources in the US Democratic Party. Why does Obama need to do this? First of all, this is an opportunity to complete what he was not allowed to do a few months ago. Secondly, this is an opportunity to leave the White House with an image of a great fighter against terrorism. Remember how Hillary Clinton virtually claimed for herself the laurels as the ¡°killer of Bin Laden¡±? Now the outgoing president has the opportunity to level the score and, if lucky, deprive Trump of the ability to win the laurels for being an active fighter against terrorism and the first to start really bombing ISIS. Here it needs to be said that everyone can understand the consequences of these decisions without resorting to any conspiracies. For example, The Washington Post ¡¯s last issue was published with the headline: ¡°Obama directs Pentagon to target al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, one of the most formidable forces fighting Assad.¡± Translated from journalistic lingo into common speech, this sounds like ¡°Help! Obama has decided to whack our main allies and reconsidered removing Assad!¡± Amazing. Trump hasn¡¯t even taken office yet, but there are already encouraging changes in how American politicians and the military are acting. Some simply don¡¯t want Trump¡¯s catchphrase ¡°You¡¯re fired!¡± thrown in their faces, while others are simply trying to solve their own problems. But no matter what, this all suits us. One thing is already clear: life will be difficult for Assad and Russia¡¯s enemies in Syria when the Russian combat group approaching the coast of Syria begins its work. It will be quite difficult for them. Now they can only hope for a miracle.

They also spoke in favor of active joint work towards their normalization and ""in the direction of constructive cooperation on a wide range of issues,"" including ""the creation of a sound basis of bilateral ties through the development of trade and economic components."" 

Both sides, as stated in the report, also agreed on the need for joint efforts in the struggle against the ""common enemy number one"" - international terrorism and extremism. ""In this vein, they also discussed issues toward settlement of the crisis in Syria."".

Arnoldski - Until recently it was believed that Donald Trump¡¯s main media weapon is his Twitter account, through which the president-elect of the US fights his political opponents, beats the media, and ¡°trolls¡± foreign politicians. But this was true only until Trump won the elections. Since his victory, the American billionaire now uses his phone as his main weapon of mass (information) destruction. For example, just recently we learned it was enough for Trump to simply talk with Putin on the phone to drive all top European officials to hysterics and panic. Only one conversation, and the British media is already talking about nervous breakdowns among Brussels politicians who simply don¡¯t understand how to live in this terrifying new reality in which the US president-elect easily finds opportunities to reach understanding with Putin. This means that many European politicians who built their careers on selling Russophobia might be left without a job, career, and money. The Financial Times writes that British diplomats are preparing for a ¡°diplomatic crisis¡± caused by a possible rapprochement between the US and Russia. Between the lines, it can be read that London has simply no ready-made solutions for this problem. The reactions of American and European media are suddenly creating some kind of aura of a miracle around Trump and Putin¡¯s conversation, or a universal catastrophe from the perspective of Clinton¡¯s supporters and ISIS fans. For example, the popular American newspaper USA Today has released a thoughtful article entitled ¡°After Trump chat, Putin's airstrikes pound Syria¡± which hints that it is Trump¡¯s fault that Russian aircraft have stepped up bombardments against the Syrian terrorists so near and dear to the heart of every true American liberal. It seems like American journalists are telling us that ¡°this wouldn¡¯t happen under Clinton¡± which, of course, is a shameless lie. Everything would be the same, the only difference being that Syrian militants would die from Russian bombs only after receiving their paychecks from the CIA or Pentagon. And now they are completely terrified, as the Americans aren't paying out and the Russians are bombing them. Let them at least feel comforted by the fact that they have sincere sympathy from Clinton¡¯s pool of American journalists. In fairness, it should be noted that Trump¡¯s phone conversations are provoking not only unhappiness, but are also a real treat. Kiev¡¯s political club is now filled with euphoria over the fact that Poroshenko managed to get through to talk to the US president-elect. This really is a great achievement. That Poroshenko didn¡¯t get told off after what official Kiev did during the American election campaigns is a real success. It is a pity that the only description of the conversation is on Poroshenko¡¯s website. Trump¡¯s official website doesn¡¯t say a word about it. Trump¡¯s website features the news of his conversation with Putin, while nothing is said of the chat with Poroshenko. Nothing at all. Poroshenko¡¯s website doesn¡¯t deserve much confidence as a source. After all, Poroshenko has already been caught in prank conversations, but even if we can assume that the two really did talk, then Kiev¡¯s euphoria is still not quite logical. Sure, official Ukrainian propaganda says that the two presidents agreed to meet, but no specifics in terms of dates were given. Does anyone really believe that Poroshenko is such a genius in psychological maneuvers and such a titan in political negotiations that he will be capable of changing the opinion of the US president-elect on Crimea, Ukraine, and the need to cooperate with Russia? It will be interesting to see how this looks. On the one hand, Trump is a billionaire, businessman, and a man with a very difficult character. On the other hand, so is Poroshenko, who quickly needs to convince Trump to pour money into the geopolitical project known as ¡°Ukraine.¡± It¡¯s a pity that they won¡¯t sell tickets to see this show. I would pay to see such with my own eyes even though I think that the conversation will not be very long. Most likely, it will end with Trump¡¯s famous catchphrase: ¡°You¡¯re fired!¡± Bloomberg has published an article headlined ¡°Trump, Putin and Sluggish Reforms Push Ukraine Toward Russia.¡± In this piece, American journalists gathered the opinions of Western politicians and experts on Ukraine¡¯s future, among which it is difficult to find anything optimistic. Overall, the interviewed experts agree that Ukraine is out of luck. For example, the ardent Russophobe and Vladimir Putin critic Ian Bremmer articulated his vision of Ukraine¡¯s future in the following words: ¡°Trump will want to put points on the board and I think it is highly likely the U.S. under Trump will move quickly to re-establish the relationship with Russia, on Syria in particular. That clearly throws Ukraine under a bus.¡± This time, I don¡¯t even want to argue with this American political scientist. Only one thing interests me: will Trump put all of Ukraine up for sale or only parts of it?

Two weeks before the most outrageous presidential election in history, the stakes for the economic future of our country are high. There is no question that the U.S. economy is in terrible shape and that the policy decisions made in the last ten years have negatively affected everyone who trades, invests, and use the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency. Are voters going to choose free market economic recovery with Trump or global collectivism with Clinton? 
The government statistics claim that there are officially 8 million unemployed but the actual unemployment numbers are closer to 16 million people. The reported labor force of almost 156 million in 2000 has shrunk to 152 million today. The reported number of Americans ¡°not in the labor force¡± is an astonishing 94 million. These are discouraged workers who are no longer counted as unemployed. This explains why this administration¡¯s unemployment numbers are so rosy and low. For up to date numbers, visit the national debt clock here. http://www.usdebtclock.org/ 
Our national debt is astronomical, approaching $20 trillion while GDP is below $19 trillion. We already owe more than we make in a year in final goods and services. Gross debt to GDP ratio is 106.38 percent. The U.S. total debt is $67 trillion. However, if we add all the unfunded liabilities such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and Obamacare , the figure jumps much higher. 
The federal budget deficit (the difference between taxation and spending) is almost $6 trillion for this year. The more indebted we are to the rest of the world and to each other, the less money will be available for future generations to improve their standard of living and to defend themselves. 
There are approximately 119 million U.S. taxpayers and approximately 124 million full-time workers. The biggest part of the revenue from taxation is spent on entitlements. Somehow, Social Security, a fund established with automatic paycheck contributions, has been lumped in with entitlements as if the Social Security fund did not belong to the tax payers but to the government. 
Our Congress loves to spend money on entitlements because the recipients vote them back into office. Revenue to GDP ratio is a positive 35.6 percent but spending to GDP ratio is a red 36.04 percent. 
During the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said that she would make sure public college education will be free, that parents will not receive a bill for their children¡¯s college degree, and she will do it by not adding one penny to the national debt. 
After fact checking the statement, it turns out to be not true. One source claims that $500 billion will be added to the national debt in the next 10 years while the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that ¡°$200 billion will be spent on infrastructure, financial aid for college students, and early childhood education.¡± 
The current student loan debt is $1.4 trillion and growing. There are 50,182,018 public school students who will eventually take advantage of this ¡°free¡± college offer Hillary Clinton has made. Who is going to pay? Taxpayers, of course, will be saddled with the cost. 
Additionally, how is she going to create jobs to employ college graduates if her plan includes raising taxes? Employers create jobs when their taxes are decreased. NAFTA, which was President Bill Clinton¡¯s achievement, has exported many manufacturing jobs overseas. Hillary Clinton supports the highly secretive Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would finish off the manufacturing sector in this country, leaving the United States as a service economy. 
We now have 12,500,256 manufacturing jobs left in this country. In 2000 we had 19,462,745 manufacturing jobs. There are about 120 million private sector jobs but large companies are pushing for more H-1B visas to import cheap technical labor from India and other foreign nations, leaving seasoned employees out of a job and having to train their replacements. More college graduates living in their parents¡¯ basement will have to work as baristas in coffee shops. 
Trump is in favor of school choice and wants to end Common Core. He favors the reintroduction of Vocational and Technical education, as well as making two and four-year college education affordable. 
Donald Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA and to withdraw from TPP. He wants to end foreign trade abuses and currency manipulation by China. He wants to repatriate our own companies by reducing corporate taxation significantly and by establishing tariffs to prevent companies from leaving in the first place. He wants to offer middle class tax relief that would help create 25 million jobs. He wants to simplify the tax code. 
Trump wants to create jobs by lifting regulatory restrictions on fossil fuel exploration and all mining. He wants to ¡°lift road blocks that prevent the Keystone pipeline from moving forward.¡± 
Trump wants to cancel payments to the United Nations Climate Fund and use the money to fix our water and environmental infrastructure. 
Hillary Clinton wants to expand illegal immigration and open borders while Trump wants to cancel federal funding of sanctuary cities that harbor criminal illegal aliens. He will ¡°suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.¡± 
He will establish punishments for visa overstays, for repeat criminal offenders, and multiple illegal border crossings. Adamant that he will build the wall with Mexico, Trump promises to remove criminal aliens from the U.S. and to cancel visas to countries that won¡¯t take them back. 
Restoring the rule of law, dismantling criminal gangs, establishing a task force on violent crime to help police, cleaning up corruption, and admitting immigrants who have been thoroughly vetted, who want to be a contributing part of our country, should go a long way to begin the process of healing our nation. 
Hillary wants to continue President Obama¡¯s policies, including the admittance of many more ¡°refugees¡± from countries that are inimical to us. 
While Hillary wants to develop Obamacare into a one payer system, Trump wants to ¡°repeal and replace¡± the very costly and unaffordable Affordable Care Act which has made healthcare premiums unaffordable for so many Americans who were forced to drop their insurance and just pay the tax penalty. 
Trump favors health savings accounts, letting states manage Medicaid funds, and allowing Americans to buy insurance across state lines. Cutting the red tape at the FDA is also on his radar. He promises to fix VA hospitals and to allow veterans to be treated by their chosen doctor in any private or public hospital. 
Will Trump have the opportunity to replace Justice Scalia or will Hillary alter the composition of the Supreme Court, turning it into a bastion of progressivism for generations to come? 
Trump promises to expand and strengthen our military, to guard our First and Second Amendments, and to protect our Constitution. 
It is time that American hard-earned dollars take care of Americans first instead of providing for the rest of the world to the detriment of poor Americans, redistributing our wealth through schemes that the globalists behind Hillary Clinton have devised. Americans want to have secure borders, sovereignty, one language, self-determination, and economic prosperity through free markets not through collectivism. shares",english,2016-10-26T22:36:44.302+03:00,freedomoutpost.com,US,40480,Free Market Economic Recovery with Trump or Global Collectivism with Hillary,0,http://freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/635847026848929168897612321-maxresdefault.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

This election remains more heated than any other in modern history ¨C and for many, it has become a call to arms, even if only metaphorically. 
Despite the fact that DNC operatives have been exposed as the ones inciting violence at rallies ¨C Robert Creamer and Scott Foval for example ¨C and working overtime to bus in illegal voters and rig the vote ¨C the media is going out of its way to paint Trump supporters and grassroots Americans as the ones plotting violence. 
Most recently, they are latching onto comments made by former congressman Joe Walsh, now a conservative radio host, who suggested he would ¡®pick up a musket¡¯ if Trump loses the election. On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. 
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. 
You in? 
¡ª Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
Did Walsh mean to imply violence? That is certainly how the media is portraying it, as his comments spark controversy and fuel fire to the debate over the nearing election. 
The irony that his commentary drew from the imagery of founding-era patriots who stood up to tyranny was deeply lost on the left, who see opponents to Hillary in black and white terms ¨C racist, xenophobic, utterly deplorable and inherently violent. 
CNN followed up, asking Walsh what he meant by statement. 
via CNN : 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
[¡­] 
Walsh ¡­ did respond to CNN¡¯s Jake Tapper via Twitter when he asked: ¡°What exactly does that mean?¡± 
¡°It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back,¡± he responded to Tapper. https://twitter.com/WalshFreedom/status/791382994783133696 https://twitter.com/WalshFreedom/status/791382994783133696 
His heated rhetoric is a response to the endless episodes of fraud, dirty trick and foul play by the Hillary campaign, as it seems that she will stop at nothing to become the first female POTUS ¨C just the sort of abuse of power that the founders warned about. 
1775-76 erupted in response to a long train of abuses ¨C acts of oppression and hostility listed in the Declaration of Independence that is being largely repeated in modern day America. 
Could Hillary¡¯s reported election victory ¨C or Donald Trump¡¯s defeat ¨C signal civil unrest and a new wave of resistance, particularly if the results are widely viewed as fraudulent or ¡°rigged¡±? Trump, for one, has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election. 
The scenario is plausible enough that the Pentagon and Homeland Security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest. 
As SHTF detailed in an exclusive report, a whistleblower has come forward on the ominous contingency plan to keep and/or restore order if the populace revolt against the establishment¡¯s ¡°selection¡± for president: 
If there is any truth to it, the 2016 election could be a kick-off for total tyranny. 
According to an unnamed source ¨C who has provided accurate intel in the past ¨C an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after. 
Date: October 30th ¨C 30 days after the election Suspected Region: Northeast, specifically New York 
1st Phase: NROL (No Rule of Law) ¨C drill involving combat arms in metro areas (active and reserve). Source says active duty and reserve service members are being vaccinated as if they are being deployed in theatre. 
2nd Phase: LROL (Limited Rule of Law) ¨C Military/FEMA consolidating resources, controlling water supply, handing out to public as needed. 
3rd Phase: AROL (Authoritarian Rule of Law) ¨C Possible new acronym or term for ¡°Martial Law¡±. Curfew, restricted movements, basically martial law scenario. 
Source said exercise involves FEMA/DHS/Military 
At this point, no one can say for certain what will happen in the aftermath of November 8, but it is clear that millions and millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the status quo, troubled about the economic realities perpetuated by the Fed and angry that Hillary may be put in the Oval Office rather than a jail cell, despite a trail of corruption with virtually no end. 
How far will things go? 
And will things ever be reset without a new American Revolution?

Will the 2016 election be rigged? 
That depends on what the definition of ¡°is¡± is ¨C and whether or not you count blatant media bias, operatives and instigators, shady quasi-voters, bizarre electronic voting ¡°errors¡± and a heavy-handed advantage in the electoral college and the shifting demographics of a socialist state that promises much to certain groups. 
With the GOP leadership turning its back on Trump, and the Democratic machine dedicated solely to providing for Her, it will be a difficult win for Trump, despite overwhelming enthusiasm at rallies across the entire country and lop-sided pro-Trump crowds that literally dwarf pro-Hillary gatherings of very few. 
But as most everyone knows by now, it isn¡¯t the popular vote that counts ¨C but only the delegates awarded state-by-state to the electoral college¡­ and that is a game that Hillary¡¯s operatives are very good at playing. Daily News Brief: The 2016 Election Is In The Process Of Being Stolen With Rigged Voting Machines 
There are several states ¨C in particular ¨C that are being surprisingly maneuvered for her advantage¡­ and if successful, will block Trump from even coming close the presidency. Texas Could Turn ¡°Blue¡± For the First Time In 20 Years 
This is the big enchilada, so to speak. For the first time in many decades, Texas is in play for Hillary and the Democrats. Texas has been as solidly ¡°red¡± as any state in the union, but 2016 could be different. 
With 38 electoral votes, the Lone Star State is the biggest prize on the map next to California, whose 55 electoral votes have gone to the Democrats since before history began. Since at least 2008, the Dems have been massaging their electioneering strategy to capitalize on shifting demographics ¨C with plenty of Hispanics in the next generation of voters. On paper, Hillary should be able to play well to Hispanics with all the controversy over Trump¡¯s immigration stances and talk of a border wall. Rumors of illegal immigrants be encouraged to vote could be a crucial factor, with polls in Texas close to neck and neck¡­ it could go either way. 
Of course, there is every reason to think that Team Hillary is not taking any chances. 
As Michael Snyder and many others have reported , electronic voting machines have been mysteriously flipping votes for Hillary in several counties in Texas¡­ and that doesn¡¯t bode well for a massive electoral prize that is within range for her campaign: 
Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. 
At least one county is making an emergency switch to paper ballots after irregularities were found with the electronic machines during early voting. 
Meanwhile, Infowars confronted the head of Texas¡¯ elections about his decision to violate voter laws and abandon a manual count of a random sampling of 1-3% of votes (which should theoretically reflect the larger voting trend, unless something is fishy). Without that count, there is less accountability than ever: 
This is major issue, and Texas isn¡¯t the only state¡­ just the biggest. 
2. Utah¡¯s Independent Republican Could Actually Beat Trump 
OK, so Utah only has a grand total of 6 electoral college votes¡­ and has never been a decisive swing state in a presidential election. But that is because the state has been so solidly ¡°red.¡± However, this election is totally different. 
A little known independent candidate named Evan McMullin has actually taken the lead in several recent polls in Utah, and is neck-and-neck with both Trump and Hillary in several other polls (at or around 30% apiece). Libertarian Gary Johnson is also playing (relatively) well at about 5% ¨C possibly enough to swing further momentum away form Trump. 
But Evan McMullin is the real surprise hit ¨C in a state that is suddenly considered an important battleground in the election. 
McMullin is a Mormon, which gives him a significant boost. He is officially tied to Better for America, which is basically a #NeverTrump operation ¨C backed by neocons like William Kristol. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Evan McMullin has a pretty colorful and telling background : on top of being a former policy director for House Republicans, he¡¯s also a former CIA operations officer; a member of the elite think tank Council on Foreign Relations (CFR); a former Goldman Sachs investment banker and a volunteer refugee resettlement officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Jordan. 
Wow! I wonder if there could be an agenda there. Hillary probably won¡¯t win Utah, but Trump may not either ¨C and it could make a crucial difference if he is within striking distance of 270 electoral votes. 
3. Florida Is a Must Win Swing State for Trump¡­ But Current Polls Show Possible Hillary Win 
Oh boy¡­ Florida all over again. With 29 electoral votes, it remains a major contender that is so often on the fence and swinging in the wind. It is considered essential for a Trump victory, and indeed for just about any successful Republican bid for the presidency. 
Sure, we all know the polls are rigged, and may be oversampling Dems to look better for Hillary on paper ¨C but nonetheless, that perception drives expectations. 
If She can create a convincing win there, it could change the course of the election once again. Florida has consistently been the closest outcome ¨C in 2008 and 2012 it went blue for Obama; in 2000 and 2004 it went red for Bush (and not without major controversy and some very shady recounting). 
Her team is pushing heavily for early voting in Florida, and so far they claim an early voting advantage. 
But campaign surrogate Roger Stone is now reporting that Hillary has met secretly with Broward County officials in Florida, and there is speculation that problems with the voting machines may soon be happening all over again. 
Pay very close to what happens there, because of course, Florida could be THE deciding state (again). Right now polls are within 2 points , currently in favor of Trump by a very narrow margin. 
4. Colorado Has Known Voting Fraud Issues ¨C With Dead People on the Voter Rolls 
With 9 electoral votes, Colorado is currently swinging ¡°blue¡± but could go either way. CBS4 and the Washington Times reported that an investigation was started by Colorado¡¯s Secretary of State after multiple examples were found of deceased people registered and in the voter rolls: 
¡°This is the kind of thing you hear rumored, joked about in Chicago, that kind of thing,¡± Mr. Maasssaid during a Thursday evening broadcast. ¡°Tonight, that changes. We did find voter fraud in Colorado that essentially waters down your vote.¡± 
[¡­] 
¡°This is the kind of thing you hear rumored, joked about in Chicago, that kind of thing,¡± Mr. Maasssaid during a Thursday evening broadcast. ¡°Tonight, that changes. We did find voter fraud in Colorado that essentially waters down your vote.¡± 
It¡¯s not clear whether or not Colorado could make a difference in the outcome, but the results could prove suspect. 
5. Hillary Is ¡°Leading¡± In These Key Swing States 
While Trump is expected to win the crucial state of Ohio, and also North Carolina, Hillary is projected to take key states including Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa, Virginia and Arizona. 
According to the Washington Post : 
if Clinton can hold Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Colorado, then she only needs one more out of many swing states ¡ª New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina, or Florida ¡ª barring any surprise Trump win in a blue-leaning state like Wisconsin. That is currently looking very plausible. 
While any of these could change in the actual outcome, it shows that Hillary has definitely maneuvered to win where it counts ¨C not with the people, but with the electoral college. 
The details are too numerous to follow here, and anything could happen. 
6. You Know Voter Fraud Is Happening If the Media Claim It Isn¡¯t 
What should be very telling to everyone is how loudly the major media ¨C in concert ¨C are trying to debunk Trump¡¯s claims of voter fraud and insist that all is well when it is quite clear that there are major issues. 
This is one claim that the system is very afraid of, because quite frankly, they have a great deal to hide. 
There is more reason than ever for accountability, reporting on any irregularities and an insistence that the will of the people be respected ¨C because the system is desperate to hold onto control at any cost.

Current events are the History of the future. However, History can be lost. People can ignore their past, live only in the now, and leave their future to chance. History provides the opportunity to learn from the mistakes of others, as well as the chance to build upon what others have learned. To ignore these two paths to success gives life to the notion that failure to plan is planning to fail. All Americans should cherish their History. We left a known and secure world for a new one. We turned an untamed land into one bustling with enterprise and development. We stood against the world¡¯s greatest superpower to assert that all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights and that among them are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We made it through a sectarian war and clawed our way from the outskirts of an Atlantic culture to the pinnacle of global dominance. Our industry, our education, our health care system, our culture , and our military became the epitome of western civilization and the envy of the entire world. There was a time in America when every child was infused with the story of America rising from nothing to the apex of power, a time when everyone was taught in Civics class about the declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the melting pot that made us the embodiment of E pluribus unum : out of many, one. Today, after the Progressives and that destroyer of education, the Department of Education, has worked for generations to dumb us down from individuals using personal freedom to succeed to induhviduals using a pack mentality to follow the herd to a ride in the entitlement hammock . Now, we glory in being a smelting pot where the cheerleaders of fragmentation parrot, ¡°Diversity is our strength,¡± as we unravel into warring factions. Hyphenated Americans of every color, creed, and ethnicity now jockey for their place in the queue as government goodies are doled out to preferred groups. Where we are today: A culture of death swallows a culture of life. A terminally ill Californian woman determined to be with her four young children for as long as she could was reportedly denied an expensive chemotherapy treatment ¡ª but won approval for a lethal drug to legally end her life. We even have a presidential candidate who says we have to ban guns to save the children, yet we need to keep partial birth abortions legal to kill the babies, and no one in the media has the insight or the integrity to call her on it. Not only is New York¡¯s Sixth Crime Family guilty of pay to play, they are also guilty of bribe to walk: The charge - A Hillary Clinton ally donated almost $500,000 to the campaign of the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the agency's probe of Clinton's email server. The particulars - Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of Bill and Hillary Clinton, donated almost $500,000 to the campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, wife of Federal Bureau of Investigation deputy director Andrew McCabe. A serial liar, unindicted co-conspirator with a notoriously philandering husband is going to win the votes of millions of low information voters, government dependents, and dead people. Early voting has started, and not only is the expected fraud showing up immediately, the imported voters are turning out en mass for open borders and an end to America as America: Residents of at least two cities in Texas are complaining that they voted for Donald Trump , only to see the voting machine switch their ballot to Hillary Clinton . And illegal immigrants have been caught on tape stuffing ballot boxes during early voting. Corruption is accepted as the norm in today¡¯s America, with a totally corrupt Hillary Clinton presented as a viable presidential candidate. Bill Clinton¡¯s type of lewd behavior, once considered unacceptable, is swept under the rug as our culture sinks to its lowest common denominator. Life is being swallowed by death, and a shining city on the hill is being remade into a squalid third world hell hole that will use our grandchildren as beasts of burden to support the human debris of failed states. The America of ¡°Give us liberty or give us death¡± has morphed into ¡°Give me bread and circuses.¡± Throw a six pack over the fence and beam a game to the flat screen and the descendants of the pioneers are ready to roll over and cash their next government check. This may be the trail chosen for us by the blind guides of the left. This may be the end of western civilization and the death of life conjured up by the globalist puppet masters who pull the strings in this final act of the Progressive Putsch; however, I choose another way.

A tidal wave is coming. 
Michael Moore, a liberal¡¯s liberal who holds die-hard loyalty to Hillary Clinton , is acknowledging what everyone with a clear head recognizes: that she doesn¡¯t even remotely connect with the average voter, doesn¡¯t understand their problems ¨C and above all, doesn¡¯t care about them. 
Although Moore can¡¯t support Donald Trump , he seems to admire his ability to resonate with the actual problems that the people who formerly made up the middle class are going through ¨C economic and otherwise. Moore, like Trump, understands the pulse of the people, though they differ in just about every other way. 
This election represents a pivotal point, and an end of the line for the deal that people once held with their leaders. After decades of broken promises and deals to sell them short and sell them out, people have had enough. 
THAT¡¯S what this election is about. 
Right or wrong, Trump represents a rebuke of the system ¨C as Moore calls it, the ultimate ¡°F¨C¨C¨C You¡± ever directed at the system. 
Listen to the audio of what Moore said ( Warning: Foul Language ): 
Here¡¯s some of what he said in an epic rant (reportedly excerpted from his rush-election film Trumpland) that is strangely validating of Trump¡¯s entire campaign: 
Whether Trump means it or not, it¡¯s kind of irrelevant because he¡¯s saying the things that people who are hurting. And it¡¯s why every beaten down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle-class loves Trump. 
¡°They¡¯re not racists or rednecks, they¡¯re actually pretty decent people. So, after talking to a number of them, I sort of wanted to sort of write this.¡± 
[¡­] 
Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said: if you close these factories, as you are planning to do in Detroit, and rebuild them in Mexico, I am going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobody¡¯s going to buy them. 
It was an amazing thing to see. No politician ¡ª Republican or Democrat ¡ª had ever said anything like that to these executives. It was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Brexit states. You live here in Ohio. You know what I am talking about. 
He is the human Molotov cocktail that they have been waiting for. The human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them. And on November 8th ¡ª Election Day ¡ª although they have lost their jobs. Although they¡¯ve been foreclosed on by the bank. Next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone. The car¡¯s been repossessed. They haven¡¯t had a real vacation in years. They¡¯re stuck with the shitty Obamacare bronze plan. They can¡¯t even get a f**king percocet. 
They have essentially lost everything they had¡­except one thing. The one thing that doesn¡¯t cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution: the right to vote. 
[¡­] So, on November 8th, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain, take that lever ¡ª or felt pen or touchscreen ¡ª and put a big f**king X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump. 
[¡­] 
They see that the elites who have ruined their lives hate Trump. 
Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The Media hates Trump¡­ 
The enemy of my enemy is who I am voting for on November 8th. 
Trump¡¯s election is going to be the biggest F**K YOU ever recorded in human history. 
And it will feel good. 
What red-blooded American, working stiff or laid off schmo wouldn¡¯t want to stick it to the establishment and rebuke the very system that brought them to this point? After all, it is their fault. 
People have been hurting and in decline for eight long years ¨C and for all his smiles and posturing, Obama hasn¡¯t done a damned thing. And Hillary can¡¯t even pretend. 
The people who will be deciding the popular vote in this election want to take down that system and put someone in who will ¨C once and for all ¨C stand up for them. Basically, Americans want revenge. 
What the electoral college decides is another matter altogether, of course.

On Monday, a man who voted for Donald Trump was arrested for wearing a T-shirt that referenced Hillary Clinton 's comments about Trump supporters being ""deplorables"" to the polls. 
Brett Mauthe, 55, was arrested after he went to the polls wearing a pro-Trump hat and a shirt that read, ""basket of deplorables."" 
According to KSAT 12, Mauthe removed his hat at the request of those who were overseeing the polls. However, since the t-shirt did not violate the election code, he refused to turn it inside out nor remove it. 
Subsequently, he was arrested and charged with electioneering. 
KSAT 12 reports : 
Bulverde police Chief Gary Haecker confirmed the arrest but declined to release details. Instead, he deferred to Comal County's election coordinator, Cynthia Jaqua. 
Jaqua said the offense of electioneering isn't limited to people who stand outside polling places holding signs. Violations can be committed by voters as well. 
""It can mean a T-shirt, a button, a hat, you know?"" she said. ""Anything related to the voting, the party, the candidate."" 
Jaqua declined to release specific details about Mauthe's arrest. 
Jaqua is quoted by My San Antonio : 
It's in the election code. Electioneering is prohibited within a 100-foot marker. You cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons, T-shirts, hats, whatever else or carrying signs,"" she said. 
Most people who make the mistake manage to avoid going to jail, she added. 
""Every election we have to advise people. Even if it's a school bond issue. They wear candidates' shirts and we just have to remind them. 'Please go into the restroom and turn it inside out.' This is the first time I recall someone getting arrested,"" she said, during two decades working at the county election office. 
""A gentleman did walk in a little while ago with a slogan for Trump, and when I asked him to please take it off, he was real nice, and took it off,"" she added, while working a polling site Thursday afternoon in New Braunfels. 
So, according to this nonsense, a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day, but if a politician make reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day? This is utterly ridiculous. 
My question on all of that is, what happened to free speech? Is that recognized as a God-given right in the First Amendment? I mean, I realize that the Constitution is to restrict the federal government, but honestly, shouldn't the states recognize the right of free speech, even in a polling place? Seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected. 
Other voters agree with me. 
""I don't feel like you should be preaching to anybody, but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate,"" Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote. ""I'm kind of shocked, because I think that's part of the freedoms that we're voting for."" 
Jose Tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are 18 and vote. Again, I ask, why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech? It's not inflammatory. It isn't a lie. It isn't slander. What's illegal about it? 
I'll tell you, politicians want to control people, and this is one of many means they use to do that. This is what happens when you don't hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose. 
Mauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media. 
""The reason I'm not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around, and I don't want to give you any comment,"" he said .

The fix is in. 
If the latest flurry of emails from the Clinton Camp prove anything, it¡¯s that Hillary Clinton ¡¯s organization has been actively manipulating and rigging the Presidential election from the get-go. We know for a fact that she colluded with Democratic National Committee to marginalize Bernie Sanders . We know her mainstream media cohorts gave her debate questions ahead of time. We know that she actively hired and organized actions in Chicago and elsewhere to make it look like Donald Trump supporters were violent. And we know from recently released John Podesta emails that they have been tampering with polls through over sampling. We also know that dead democrats all over the country are voting in the Presidential election. 
Thus, it stands to reason that if there¡¯s any way to rig actual election outcomes either through hacking electronic voting systems or other ballot machinations, the Clinton campaign will do everything in their power to take advantage of it. 
In the video below The Daily Sheeple¡¯s Weekly Word explains that there are five key states that are actively being target for election fraud:

Donald Trump has all the momentum now. Will it be enough to propel him to victory on election day? Trump¡¯s poll numbers were improving even before we learned that the FBI had renewed its investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s emails , and the new survey results that came out over the weekend and on Monday make it clear that Clinton¡¯s ¡°certain victory¡± is not so certain after all. Unless something changes, Americans are going to go to the polls on November 8th with an FBI criminal investigation hanging over the Clinton campaign like an ominous cloud, and that is very good news for Trump. 
The Clinton campaign was hoping that this renewed investigation would not ¡°move the needle¡±, but unfortunately for them that appears not to be the case. Hillary¡¯s unfavorable rating just hit an all-time high , a whopping 45 percent of all Americans believe that this scandal is ¡°worse than Watergate¡±, and a Rasmussen survey has found that 40 percent of all undecided voters that are leaning toward voting for Hillary Clinton are still open to changing their minds before election day. 
And even before this story broke on Friday, Clinton was having a difficult time getting her voters to the polls. According to the New York Times , early voting among young adults and African-American voters is significantly down compared to 2012, and those are demographic groups that Clinton desperately needs to turn out in large numbers. 
But of course the key to winning the election is getting to 270 electoral votes, and poll numbers appear to be shifting in the key swing states that Trump and Clinton both desperately need. For a moment, I would like to examine what the numbers currently look like in some of the most important states¡­ 
Florida 
Without Florida, Donald Trump has absolutely no chance of winning. This is something that even the Trump campaign has admitted. That is why it was so alarming that most of the polls in October had Hillary Clinton leading in the state. 
Fortunately for Trump, a new survey that was conducted on Sunday shows him leading in Florida by four points . 
Georgia 
Georgia wasn¡¯t supposed to be a problem. Georgia has traditionally been a deep red state, but polling throughout this election season had shown a very tight race. This had Republicans deeply concerned and the Clinton camp very happy. 
But now the momentum has seemingly shifted and the latest poll has Trump up by seven points . 
North Carolina 
Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, and Donald Trump very much needs to win it if he hopes to be triumphant on November 8th. Hillary Clinton was shown to be leading in the eight most recent polls before the email story broke, but in the first major survey conducted afterwards she is now down by two points . 
Ohio 
No Republican has ever won the presidency without Ohio, and Trump knows how important it is to his chances. The three most recent polls conducted before the FBI renewed the investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s emails all showed a tie, but now the very first survey conducted afterwards shows Trump up by five points . 
Colorado 
Hillary Clinton has consistently been in the lead in Colorado throughout this campaign, and most experts didn¡¯t give Trump much of a chance in the state, but the latest survey shows that Clinton¡¯s lead has been whittled down to just one point . 
Arizona 
A survey that was conducted in mid-October showed Clinton having a five point lead in John McCain¡¯s home state, but now the latest major poll has Trump up by two points . 
Nevada 
One of the most important swing states out west is Nevada, and most surveys showed Hillary Clinton with a strong lead throughout the month of October. Unfortunately for her, a poll that was conducted on Sunday shows Donald Trump with a four point lead . 
Clearly Trump has the momentum at this point, and it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change over the next few days. 
And as we learn more about what is in these newly discovered emails, will her fellow Democrats stick with her? Already, some are publicly wavering. The following example comes from WND ¡­ 
Longtime Clinton confidante and former Democratic pollster Doug Schoen told Fox News the newly renewed FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s private email server is forcing him to ¡°reassess¡± his support for the Democratic nominee for president. 
Schoen, a Fox News contributor, made the comments to host Harris Faulkner during a live television appearance Sunday night on ¡°Fox Report Weekend.¡± 
Public opinion is shifting quickly, but the bad news for Trump is that more than 23 million Americans have already voted. So millions upon millions of Americans cast their votes before they even learned of this new FBI investigation. If the race is very close, that could end up making the difference. 
And of course the race could dramatically change once again if the FBI comes to some sort of resolution about these new emails prior to November 8th. On Monday, CNN reported that a resolution before election day did not appear to be likely¡­ 
FBI officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to its investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s private server before the November 8 election. 
The initial work of cataloging top Clinton aide Huma Abedin ¡¯s emails found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner¡¯s laptop could be done in the next few days, US law enforcement officials told CNN. 
But the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other work, including likely working with other federal agencies to determine what ¡ª if any ¡ª classified materials are in the emails. This makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election. 
However, late on Monday evening the Drudge Report reported that the L.A. Times has learned that investigators may have a ¡°preliminary assessment¡± completed ¡°in coming days¡±¡­ 
LA TIMES TUESDAY: FBI Investigators had planned to conduct new email review over several weeks. It now hopes to complete ¡®preliminary assessment¡¯ in coming days, but agency officials have not decided how, or whether, they will disclose results publicly¡­ Developing¡­ 
Whether good or bad, I do believe that the American people deserve to hear something conclusive about these emails before November 8th. 
If nothing is found to implicate Clinton, the American people should be told that. 
And if evidence of very serious crimes is discovered, there is no way in the world that should be held back until after the election. 
Even if it throws the election into complete and utter chaos , the American people deserve to know the truth. 
But will we get it? 
Stay tuned, because I think that this is going to be a crazy week.

What happens when you get thousands of lawyers involved in the craziest election in modern American history? Unfortunately, we may be about to find out. We all remember the legal tug of war between Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000, and with each passing day it is becoming more likely that we could see something similar (or even worse) in 2016. In a brand new article entitled ¡° Clinton, Trump Prepare for Possibility of Election Overtime ¡°, Bloomberg discusses the armies of lawyers that Clinton and Trump are both assembling for this election. It would be nice if it was the American people that actually decided the outcome of this election, but if things are very close on November 8th it may come down to what the courts decide. 
Traditionally, there has been a lot of pressure on the losing candidate to concede to the winning candidate before election night is over. 
However, in recent elections this has begun to change. I already mentioned what took place in the aftermath of the 2000 election, and in 2004 John Kerry did not concede to George W. Bush until the next morning. 
And looking back at the numbers from the 2012 election, it is clear that Mitt Romney should not have conceded the race to Barack Obama so early. There was evidence of election fraud in key battleground states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado and Virginia , and many people out there still believe that Mitt Romney would have won if the election would have been conducted fairly. 
So when Donald Trump says that he may not immediately concede the election if the results are tight, I think that there is wisdom in that. 
A couple of weeks ago, it looked like we may have had a situation where Hillary Clinton could have won by a landslide . But the FBI changed everything when they announced that they were renewing their investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s emails. Since that announcement, the poll numbers have been rapidly shifting and now Trump has all of the momentum . 
For example, the ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll had Hillary Clinton up by double digits not too long ago, but now it is showing a one point lead for Trump . 
The race is very close at this point, and if the race to 270 electoral votes is razor tight on election night, I don¡¯t anticipate that either candidate will be eager to concede. We could see a prolonged legal battle ensue, and that could mean that we don¡¯t have a new president until long after election day is over. 
Already, both campaigns are assembling large armies of lawyers. In fact, Bloomberg is reporting that Clinton already has ¡°thousands of lawyers¡± that have donated their time to her campaign¡­ 
Clinton is assembling a voter protection program that has drawn thousands of lawyers agreeing to lend their time and expertise in battleground states, though the campaign isn¡¯t saying exactly how many or where. It is readying election observers in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada and Arizona to assess any concerns ¡ª including the potential for voter intimidation ¡ª and to verify normal procedures. 
The Republican National Lawyers Association, which trains attorneys in battleground states and in local jurisdictions where races are expected to be close, aims to assemble 1,000 lawyers ready to monitor polls and possibly challenge election results across the country. Hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, one of Trump¡¯s biggest backers, has sunk $500,000 into the group, its biggest donation in at least four presidential elections, Internal Revenue Service filings show. 
And most Americans don¡¯t realize this, but Reuters is reporting that the Democrats have already filed election-related lawsuits in four key swing states¡­ 
Democratic Party officials sued Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in four battleground states on Monday, seeking to shut down a poll-watching effort they said was designed to harass minority voters in the Nov. 8 election . 
In lawsuits filed in federal courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona and Ohio, Democrats argued that Trump and Republican Party officials were mounting a ¡°campaign of vigilante voter intimidation¡± that violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and an 1871 law aimed at the Ku Klux Klan. 
Meanwhile, the legal challenges for the Clinton campaign continue to mount. The renewed investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s mishandling of classified documents is just one of five FBI investigations that are currently looking into the conduct of ¡°Clinton¡¯s inner circle¡± ¡­ 
There are, in fact, not one but five separate FBI investigations which involve members of Clinton¡¯s inner circle or their closest relatives ¨C the people at the center of what has come to be known as Clintonworld. 
The five known investigations are into: Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin¡¯s estranged husband sexting a 15-year-old; the handling of classified material by Clinton and her staff on her private email server; questions over whether the Clinton Foundation was used as a front for influence-peddling; whether the Virginia governor broke laws about foreign donations; and whether Hillary¡¯s campaign chairman¡¯s brother did the same. 
Despite everything that we already know about Hillary, about half the country still plans to vote for her. 
If the American people willingly choose to elect the most corrupt presidential candidate in our history, it may be a sign that the events that I talk about in my new book are a lot closer than many people had originally been anticipating. 
But the good news is that a Clinton victory is looking a whole lot less likely than it was just a week or two ago. 
Could it be possible that the FBI has just delivered the ¡° miracle ¡± that Donald Trump desperately needed? 
Americans are more emotionally invested in this presidential campaign than they have been in any presidential campaign since at least 1980. Many of those that are backing Trump will be emotionally devastated if he does not win on November 8th, but if Trump does win we are likely to see the radical left throw a political temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. 
Earlier today, I shared with my readers the amazing fact that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old during his first full day in the White House if he wins the election. 
Many conservatives are fully convinced that it is Donald Trump¡¯s destiny to be president. 
Personally, I do not know what is going to happen. But with a race this close, it may be the courts that end up deciding who our next president is, and that is an outcome that none of us should want to see.

A couple of weeks ago, it looked like Hillary Clinton was all set to cruise to victory , but now the FBI has delivered an election miracle in the nick of time. A few of my readers had criticized me for suggesting that Trump might lose, but I don¡¯t know who is going to win the election, and so all I had to go on was the cold, hard numbers. And a couple of weeks ago the cold, hard numbers were telling me   was going to win. Of course it is entirely possible that the national polls might have been seriously wrong, but even the state polls in the most important battleground states consistently had bad news for Trump. So things didn¡¯t look good for Trump at the time, but now   their   emails the poll numbers have shifted dramatically in Trump¡¯s favor . 
As I write this article, the national polls have really tightened up. In fact, the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll puts Trump 1 point ahead of Clinton. Trump has all of the momentum at the moment, but that does not mean that he is going to win. As we have seen already in this race, one day can literally change everything. 
And as I noted yesterday , more than 23 million Americans have already voted, and most of that voting was done during a period of time when Hillary Clinton was doing very well in the polls. 
So we shall see what happens. But if Trump does win on November 8th, there is a fact about his birthday which will start to get a lot of attention. 
Donald Trump was born on June 14th, 1946. If you move ahead 70 years from that date, that brings you to June 14th, 2016. Moving forward another 7 months brings you to January 14th, 2017, and moving forward another 7 days brings you to January 21st, 2017. 
And if Donald Trump wins the election, January 21st will be his first full day in office. 
Of course Trump would be inaugurated on January 20th, but he would only be president for part of that day. 
So that means that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day as president of the United States. 
And this would happen during year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar. 
These amazing ¡°coincidences¡± were first pointed out on Facebook by a user named Alyson Kelly. Some may take these numbers as a sign that Donald Trump is supposed to become the next president, but I want to make it exceedingly clear that I do not know what is going to happen, nor am I making any sort of prediction about what is going to happen. 
I just thought that this information was ¡°interesting¡± and so I thought that I would share it. 
Someone that does believe that Trump is going to win is Glenn Beck. He was been virulently anti-Trump throughout this campaign, but now he is convinced that Clinton will be unable to overcome this new email scandal, and he is calling this renewed investigation by the FBI ¡°the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America.¡± 
Beck also says that if Clinton wins now it will be evidence that ¡°magic exists¡±, and he is currently projecting that Trump should win the national vote by 5 points ¡­ 
¡°Let¡¯s just say he was 8 points, that was fair to say, 8 points behind last week,¡± Beck said, according to a transcript posted on his website . ¡°He should win by 5 points.¡± 
Beck later added: ¡°How can the next president face a possible collapsing economy, possible war with Russia, and a current war with ISIS? Oh, and also, be under FBI investigation and indictment? Can¡¯t. Can¡¯t.¡± 
The conservative personality called the latest FBI revelation ¡°the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America¡± and added that if Clinton still managed to win, it would be akin to proof ¡°magic exists.¡± 
Hopefully Glenn Beck is right, because none of us should want to see Hillary Clinton in the White House. 
She is the most evil, corrupt and scandal-ridden politician of this generation, and I can¡¯t understand how any American in their right mind could possibly vote for her. 
And the hits just keep on coming. Wikileaks has just released an email in which John Podesta told Clinton ¡°fixer¡± Cheryl Mills that they were ¡°going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later¡± ¡­ 
It was not entirely clear what Podesta meant by that phrase, but it could potentially be smoking gun   . 
Back in 2008, Barack Obama was new, intriguing and mysterious. We didn¡¯t know a lot about him, and so one can almost understand how the American people could have been fooled by him. 
But in 2016, Americans know more about Hillary Clinton than they have ever known about any candidate in modern American history. 
The Clintons have a history of crimes and scandals that goes all the way back to the 1980s, but about half the country is choosing to ignore all of that history and vote for her anyway. 
I believe that this election is America¡¯s final exam. Originally there were 17 Republicans and 5 Democrats running for the presidency. When you throw in the major third party candidates, that brings us to a total of approximately 25 people that the American public could have chosen from. 
If the American people willingly choose the most wicked candidate out of all of them after everything that has been revealed, I don¡¯t think that anyone will be able to say that we don¡¯t deserve the bitter consequences that follow that decision. 
The time for talking is almost over, and shortly we shall find out which path the American people have chosen. 
If that choice turns out to be Hillary Clinton after everything that we have seen during this election cycle, I truly believe that we will have reached the point of no return as a nation.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been criticized for his response as to whether he¡¯d accept 2016 election results. His exact words: ¡°I¡¯ll keep you in suspense.¡± Several pundits think that statement cost him the election. But read more broadly, the way the subliminal mind does, and his response was brilliant, revealing his astute instincts emanating from the newly discovered unconscious super intelligence (which we all possess). 
His word ¡°suspense¡± implies an unfolding drama. Indeed, the depth of this drama is immeasurable. But Trump¡¯s telling America a secret story. 
His story is told through his super intelligence which quick reads situations before telling what it perceives between the lines. Trump¡¯s super-intel is naturally attuned to other persons¡¯ subconscious confessions. They do so in the symbolic language of ¡°protests too much¡± denial and ¡°log in your eye¡± projection along with other key imagery. 
His super-intel quick reads Hillary Clinton and the media and conveys his response indirectly in code. 
There¡¯s far more to the media¡¯s insistence that Trump was violating rules by not accepting election results. The media asked, ¡°Are you going to play by the rules of prior presidential candidates?¡± But the big picture behind this election focuses on presidents playing by the rules, specifically the rule of law. 
Unconsciously, Trump¡¯s answer implied that the candidacy of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, raises serious rule of law questions. 
For two weeks the media harangued Trump complaining he¡¯d not played by society¡¯s accepted rules of sexual conduct. That criticism continued while they ignored Hillary¡¯s longtime enabling of her husband¡¯s abusive sexual behavior and her documented harassment of his victims as well as her own sexual escapades. The media wanted to turn this sexual matter into the central rule of law issue while a far more important rule of law issue regarding the nation¡¯s foundation still sits on the table. 
As Roger L. Simon of pjmedia.com wrote on March 23, 2016, ¡°The very backbone of our country was the rule of law. Without [it]¡­ America as we know it does not exist.¡± Simon declared Americans must be convinced that the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton¡¯s email matter was handled justly and that Obama dare not interfere. Neither condition was satisfied. Obama avowed long before the Department of Justice ruled that Hillary was innocent. 
Then FBI Director James Comey in July 2016 detailed many of Hillary¡¯s rule of law violations and in a denial confession¡ªreading through his ¡°protests too much¡±¡ªrevealed she should have been prosecuted although Comey lacked the courage to see it through. (On October 28 th under pressure from newly discovered emails he reopened the investigation.) 
As Simon warned, Democrats nominated an illegal candidate who should have been tried for breaking the law. Trump reiterated that Hillary shouldn¡¯t have been allowed to run. 
Trump also reading Obama¡¯s law-breaking Yet there¡¯s a deeper, far more powerful story Trump unconsciously hints at ¡ªone which terrifies Democrats and the entire political class. 
Trump demonstrates his subtle super-intel instincts. He¡¯s far ahead of the media¡¯s conscious take. Deep down, Trump focused on Barack Obama who facilitated Hillary Clinton¡¯s violation of the law in her email scandal. 
Trump alludes to a far more significant rule of law issue. His super-intel continues asking the greatest question regarding the legality of any presidential election in U.S. history: the question of Obama¡¯s citizenship in 2008 and 2012. 
From 2008 to 2015, Donald Trump stood strong, demonstrating presidential-type leadership by insisting on respect for the Constitution. He questioned Obama¡¯s failure to produce evidence of legal U.S. citizenship. When Obama produced his alleged birth certificate under pressure in 2011, Trump was aware that Sheriff Joe Arpaio¡¯s panel of document examiners declared it a phony . 
The media buried the issue. Reporters abused millions of Americans, including Trump, by labeling them racist conspiracy theorists¡ªa basic projection reflecting that the PC media was itself ¡°enabling the Obama conspiracy¡± at the expense of our Constitution. 
Don¡¯t believe Trump¡¯s no longer a birther. Only recently, to avoid media harassment, did he claim that he accepted Obama¡¯s U.S. citizenship. But besides the birth issue, Trump saw that Obama continually functioned as an illegal president . To America¡¯s detriment he repeatedly violated laws on a whim, for example by ignoring immigration laws. 
When Obama continually neglected to protect America¡¯s national security, Trump confronted him. Trump recognized Obama had increasingly enabled Islamic terrorists while simultaneously building up terrorist Iran, even giving them a nuclear bomb on a layaway plan and cash money to boot. 
Following the June 11, 2016 Orlando massacre perpetrated by an Islamic terrorist, Trump confronted Obama, observing that Obama wouldn¡¯t identify the enemy¡ªcall them by their name, ¡°Islamic terrorists¡±¡ªand Trump suggested Obama unconsciously knew the many reasons he should resign the presidency. 
On the surface, Obama became enraged, but unconsciously Trump elicited from Obama the most shocking confession imaginable. Secretly Obama wants the truth known. 
On the heels of Trump¡¯s challenge, Obama explained between the lines of two speeches on June 12 and 14, that he was truly a mind-controlled Stockholm Syndrome prisoner of radical Islam, programmed at an early age in his own home. 
The decoded details are described in my book, The Stockholm Syndrome President, How Trump Triggered Obama¡¯s Hidden Confession . 
As he intuitively put together the story of his life, Obama learned the horrifying family secret that his Muslim father had wanted him aborted. 
(My scientific forensic profiling approach confirmed that Obama¡¯s super-intel imagery pointed toward a near abortion which matched his life¡¯s circumstances including a promiscuous 17 year-old mother unexpectedly pregnant from a casual affair.) 
His father had also emotionally ¡°killed him¡± by abandoning him. Obama felt that pain on a daily basis, and then he learned that his father physically abused his mother and two later wives in Kenya. 
The near-death by abortion and constant death experience at the hands of his anti-American Muslim father became fixated in Obama¡¯s mind. He became frozen in terror¡ªsuffering a deep early-childhood trauma¡ªterrified that his father would kill him at any moment. 
When he was a child, his father was radical Islam to him¡ªboth one and the same. To stay alive Obama became an unconscious Stockholm Syndrome victim controlled by Islam¡ªexplaining his repeated capitulations to them as president and his curious refusal to use that term. 
Obama¡¯s Stockholm Syndrome remains buried deep in his psyche. Only his unconscious super-intel can tell his story in its psycholinguistic language. In his recent speeches, he unknowingly confessed in key images such as ¡°doing the terrorists¡¯ work for them¡± or key denials ¡°then the terrorists would win. I¡¯m not going to let that happen.¡± 
But Obama further confessed in his June 14 speech, that he was programmed as ¡°a radical Islam mole¡± to carry out a major robbery from America¡ª first by stealing the rule of law and running as an illegal president. 
In fact, Obama has robbed America in many ways: economically with massive debt and hampering business; robbed us of our borders with massive illegal immigration; of gains in racial harmony; of safe communities, of police safety, of inner city safety, of affordable health care, of military power and of our world leadership role. All the while his policies have strengthened terrorist Iran and radical Islam. 
Now return to Trump¡¯s threatened refusal to accept the election results. Consider his brilliant super-intel message to the media: ¡°You keep America in suspense about how you avoid the rule of law both with Hillary Clinton and especially Obama, and I will keep you in suspense as to what I¡¯ll do about it.¡± 
Consciously Trump may not yet fully appreciate his deeper plans, but he hints at them strongly. 
If Trump wins he could appoint a special committee of document examiners to study Obama¡¯s birth certificate. As Obama and Clinton have reversed themselves on gay marriage, Trump could simply change his mind about the need to clarify Obama¡¯s birthplace. 
But if Trump loses he could still rise to the occasion by putting rule of law money behind a renewed investigation. He could potentially mobilize an abused citizenry. Rule of law Americans could demand Congress take action and legally obtain Obama¡¯s birth records¡ªas Obama himself, the traumatized child, has unconsciously encouraged. Obama¡¯s super-intel, like Trump¡¯s and all others, fully espouses the rule of law. And the need for America to re-embrace its moral compass is the most significant story of the election of 2016.

On a rooftop overlooking the walls of Jerusalem¡¯s Old City, around 200 American-Israeli fans of Donald Trump gathered to proclaim their support for the Republican candidate, convinced he will be Israel¡¯s best friend if elected. 
Wearing ¡°Make America Great Again¡± baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didn¡¯t care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters. 
¡°Trump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, that¡¯s what I like,¡± David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday. 
¡°He¡¯s not a saint, but look at his achievements. He¡¯s not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and he¡¯s not going to support the two-state solution,¡± he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians. 
Trump has said that the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign. 
Others at the rally said they liked the fact that Trump was promising to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, officially recognizing Jerusalem as Israel¡¯s capital, and would not berate Israel for building Jewish settlements in occupied territory. 
¡°It¡¯s very important that he becomes president,¡± said Connie Gordner, 82, who moved to Israel from Jacksonville, Florida, 21 years ago. ¡°If Hillary Clinton becomes president, we¡¯re dead.¡± 
The rally was organized by Republicans Overseas Israel, which estimates that there are 300,000 U.S. citizens living in Israel or in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek for their own state. 
Even if only a third of those cast absentee ballots, organizers believe it could have an impact in some swing states, come Nov. 8. Marc Zell, co-chairman of the non-profit group, believes around three-quarters of American-Israelis support the Republican party and its candidate. 
In an impassioned speech to the small crowd, David Friedman, Trump¡¯s adviser on Israel, heaped criticism on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for her decisions as secretary of state and said Trump was Israel¡¯s greatest hope. 
¡°Under Trump, the United States will never pressure Israel into accepting a two-state solution or any other solution that is against the wishes of the Israeli people,¡± he said, to whoops, cheers and a few shouts of ¡°Crooked Hillary¡±. 
While the motley crowd was unabashed in its Trumpian fervor, polls indicate that most Jewish Israelis favor Clinton over Trump, by 40 percent to 31 percent. 
The critical element is American-Israelis who retain the right to vote in U.S. elections. Some estimates suggest more than a quarter of them live in settlements, which tend to have a more conservative, national-religious outlook. Trump¡¯s messages have been designed to appeal to their sentiments. 
On Wednesday, he delivered a minute-long video to the rally, playing up his connections to Judaism through his daughter¡¯s marriage, saying it enhanced his respect for the faith. 
¡°My administration will stand side-by-side with the Jewish people and Israel¡¯s leaders to continue strengthening the bridges that connect not only Jewish Americans and Israelis but also all Americans and Israelis,¡± he said.

TEL AVIV ¨C Donald Trump told a Republican rally in Jerusalem on Wednesday that he loves Judaism and will work to make ¡°America and Israel safe again.¡± 
¡°I love Israel and honor and respect the Jewish tradition and it¡¯s important we have a president who feels the same way,¡± Trump said in a video message via satellite to several hundred Israelis and Americans who had gathered for the event. 
¡°My administration will stand side-by-side with the Jewish people and Israel¡¯s leaders to continue strengthening the bridges that connect not only Jewish-Americans and Israelis, but also all Americans and Israelis,¡± Trump said. 
¡°Together we will stand up to enemies, like Iran, bent on destroying Israel and her people, together we will make America and Israel safe again,¡± he added. 
The event, organized by Republicans Overseas Israel on the rooftop of a restaurant overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem, was titled ¡°Jerusalem Forever,¡± in protest of the recent UNESCO resolutions that erased Jewish and Christian connections to the holy city. 
Last week, Trump slammed the resolution as a ¡°one-sided attempt to ignore Israel¡¯s 3,000-year bond to its capital city¡± and ¡°further evidence of the enormous anti-Israel bias¡± at the United Nations. 
Trump¡¯s running mate Mike Pence also addressed the event via video, saying that Jerusalem is ¡°the eternal undivided capital of the Jewish people and the Jewish state.¡± 
¡°Donald Trump and I stand with Israel because Israel¡¯s fight is our fight, because Israel¡¯s cause is our cause,¡± he said. ¡°Israel is our most cherished ally.¡± Pence added that he and Trump ¡°understand that Israel is not hated by her enemies for what she does wrong but rather for what she does right.¡± 
¡°Like the U.S., Israel is hated by terrorists and the failed states that support them. She is hated by too many progressives, because she is successful and her people are free,¡± he said. 
Pence also said Israel¡¯s military defends the Jewish state with ¡°decency, humanity and restraint.¡± 
Trump¡¯s adviser on Israel affairs, David Friedman, came to Israel for the event. He promised the crowd that if Trump were elected he would treat Israel very differently than the Obama administration. 
He added that Trump would make good on his promise to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. 
¡°Under a Trump administration there is going to be no daylight between the U.S. and the State of Israel,¡± he said. ¡°If there are disagreements they will be handled in private as is done between close friends.¡± 
According to Friedman, some 80 percent of registered U.S. voters in Israel are expected to vote for Trump. 
Many of the Trump supporters at the rally were sporting red ¡°Make America Great Again¡± hats and said they believed he was the most pro-Israel candidate to lead America. 
¡°I¡¯m here today to show support for Donald Trump as he is standing with us, supporting us here in Israel,¡± the Times of Israel quoted Reuven Ashenberg saying. Ashenberg, originally from Teaneck, New Jersey, now runs the Republican party¡¯s campaign in Beit Shemesh. 
¡°He¡¯s the only candidate that¡¯s pro-Israel and we need to show him our support as we¡¯re rallying around the right choice, to help ¡®Make America Great Again,¡¯ and thereby helping Israel become great again as well,¡± Ashenberg said. 
Abe Marks, who hails from New York and now lives in Jerusalem, said his biggest concern about Hillary Clinton would be who she appoints to the Supreme Court. Her choices ¡°will be destructive to American freedoms and the American way of life.¡± 
Marks admitted that while he was not completely ¡°enamored¡± by Trump, he likes that ¡°he¡¯s not part of the big boys¡¯ club.¡± Clinton, Marks said, was ¡°under the thumb of the New World Order¡± and as such he¡¯s ¡°very, very scared of her.¡±

Sure, Hillary Clinton is a banshee nightmare from Hell, but that really doesn¡¯t mean Donald Trump is automatically amazing just because literally anything is better than Hillary. That¡¯s a pretty low bar. 
Trump has assured us he¡¯ll give a lot more power to Big Brother as if we aren¡¯t already living in an Orwellian nightmare as it is. He has said that he will grow the police state, boost the Patriot Act, and extend the neverending wars (he keeps mentioning Iran specifically, because no matter who becomes president, they all know they have to sing that same old ¡°Which Path to Persia?¡± tune). Once I even heard the man say he expects the NSA to be listening in to all our phone calls¡­ guess that makes it okay???

He also banned Snowden from Miss Universe¡­ which I¡¯m sure must¡¯ve really broken poor Edward¡¯s heart. Message to Edward Snowden, you¡¯re banned from @MissUniverse . Unless you want me to take you back home to face justice!

How is exposing the tyrannical government¡¯s crimes against the people a traitorous act worthy of death? 
And this talk of ¡°justice¡±? 
Real justice would be someone standing up for the Constitution and Bill of Rights and challenging Big Brother and the NSA surveillance state, something neither Trump nor Hillary ever planned to do. 
Then again, Trump is the same guy who said he would ¡°take out¡± the family members of terrorists. Do you have a criminal in the family? How would you like to be killed because your family member is a criminal? Same logic fail. 
Like this government is honest about who the real terrorists even are anyway. Come on. If we¡¯re to believe Trump is that naive, he shouldn¡¯t go anywhere near the oval office.

Despite the fact that DNC operatives have been exposed as the ones inciting violence at rallies ¨C Robert Creamer and Scott Foval for example ¨C and working overtime to bus in illegal voters and rig the vote ¨C the media is going out of its way to paint Trump supporters and grassroots Americans as the ones plotting violence. 
Most recently, they are latching onto comments made by former congressman Joe Walsh, now a conservative radio host, who suggested he would ¡®pick up a musket¡¯ if Trump loses the election. On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump.

Did Walsh mean to imply violence? That is certainly how the media is portraying it, as his comments spark controversy and fuel fire to the debate over the nearing election. 
The irony that his commentary drew from the imagery of founding-era patriots who stood up to tyranny was deeply lost on the left, who see opponents to Hillary in black and white terms ¨C racist, xenophobic, utterly deplorable and inherently violent. 
CNN followed up, asking Walsh what he meant by statement.

His heated rhetoric is a response to the endless episodes of fraud, dirty trick and foul play by the Hillary campaign, as it seems that she will stop at nothing to become the first female POTUS ¨C just the sort of abuse of power that the founders warned about. 
1775-76 erupted in response to a long train of abuses ¨C acts of oppression and hostility listed in the Declaration of Independence that is being largely repeated in modern day America. 
Could Hillary¡¯s reported election victory ¨C or Donald Trump¡¯s defeat ¨C signal civil unrest and a new wave of resistance, particularly if the results are widely viewed as fraudulent or ¡°rigged¡±? Trump, for one, has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election. 
The scenario is plausible enough that the Pentagon and Homeland Security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest. 
As SHTF detailed in an exclusive report, a whistleblower has come forward on the ominous contingency plan to keep and/or restore order if the populace revolt against the establishment¡¯s ¡°selection¡± for president: 
If there is any truth to it, the 2016 election could be a kick-off for total tyranny.

Date: October 30th ¨C 30 days after the election Suspected Region: Northeast, specifically New York 
1st Phase: NROL (No Rule of Law) ¨C drill involving combat arms in metro areas (active and reserve). Source says active duty and reserve service members are being vaccinated as if they are being deployed in theatre.

Apparently, it is too much to ask for. 
Both presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton have ties to convicted pedophile and Democratic donor, billionaire Jeffery Epstein and ¡°Sex Slave Island.¡± 
Note: President Bill Clinton is not merely the husband of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, either. Bill is currently campaigning for his wife, plus Hillary recently unveiled that Bill with be in charge of ¡° revitalizing the economy ¡± if she were to take office. 
It has been uncovered that Clinton, known for his trouble-making libido, has even stronger ties to Epstein than previously reported. As noted by The Free Beacon , ¡°Clinton was aboard the infamous Lolita Express owned by a billionaire pedophile at least 26 times,¡± not the initially reported 11 times. 
Fox News reports : 
Clinton¡¯s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein¡¯s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including ¡°Tatiana.¡± The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls¡­Official flight logs filed with the Federal Aviation Administration show Clinton traveled on some of the trips with as many as 10 U.S. Secret Service agents. However, on a five-leg Asia trip between May 22 and May 25, 2002, not a single Secret Service agent is listed. 
The Republican presumptive nominee apparently got in on the action, too. Trump¡¯s ties to Epstein ¡ª a man Trump once called a ¡°terrific guy¡± ¡ª and Sex Slave Island have been chronicled by The Daily Wire here . 
Per The Political Insider, Trump is accused of threatening and raping a 13-year-old girl on the private island . Epstein is also named in the suit for sexual misconduct. The lawsuit accusations have been vehemently denied by the Trump camp, alleging that the filing is a ¡°hoax¡± and that there is ¡°no evidence¡± that the plaintiff in question ¡°actually exists.¡± 
Sex Slave Island, sometimes referred to as ¡°Orgy Island,¡± (both lovely names), is one deranged place, allegedly rife with solicited sex, often from minors ¡° groomed ¡± by Epstein. 
¡°Terrific guy¡± Epstein, of course, was convicted for soliciting sex from a minor in 2008; the billionaire served 13 months in prison.

We've recently had two object lessons in the worthlessness of the ""Trump is Doomed"" polling saga. A few days ago, the media was loudly trumpeting that Hillary's victory was inevitable, that the polls were in and she was going to ignore Trump and focus on building her administration and winning downticket races. And then, just like last time around, the numbers turned around again. 
I was recently asked to predict the race. I answered that the one thing I could predict is that the media will claim a landslide for Hillary right before the election. That much is very likely. 
It's in the media's interest to spread FUD by promoting polls that predict not just a Hillary win, but a landslide, creating the perception that voting is useless. The more Republicans feel that the outcome is futile, the less likely they will be to go out and vote. But the scandal polling numbers have a history of rebounding. This remains a challenging and very unusual election. 
The premature panic we've seen in some circles is unhealthy. We shouldn't completely ignore poll numbers, but neither should we treat them as inevitable.

Remember last week when Hillary Clinton was shopping around for White House drapes and the ""popular"" wisdom was that she was inevitable? That was fun. Wasn't it. Now she hit an unfavorability rating high of 60 percent. That's higher than Trump. 
It also means that the candidate who claims she's going to bring Americans together is disliked by most of the country . 
Clinton is seen unfavorably by 60 percent of likely voters in the latest results, a new high. Trump is seen unfavorably by essentially as many -- 58 percent.

Independents are the largest political group in the country. Larger than either Democrats or Republicans. And they're tilting toward Trump and the GOP. 
Adding in ideology, the tracking poll shows Clinton going from 95 percent support among liberal Democrats early in the tracking poll to 88 percent now, while Trump's gone from 89 percent among conservative Republicans to 94 percent now. 
Independents -¨C sometimes swing voters in past elections, albeit inconsistently ¨C- also merit attention. They've gone from a scant 6 points in Clinton's favor in the first four nights of tracking, 44-38 percent, to a substantial Trump lead now, 34-51 percent, Clinton-Trump. 
A key element here is the partisan preferences of independents who emerge as likely to vote: They were 2 points more likely to lean toward the Republican Party rather than the Democratic Party at the start of tracking, but are 10 points more apt to do so now. 
Hillary Clinton tried to win over independents by positioning her brand as a moderate centrist who can work with Republicans and can get things done while portraying Trump as dangerous and irresponsible. It certainly worked to a degree. 
Trump's pitch was that he's not a conventional Republican and he can overturn a rigged system. The drain the swamp speech was a key element. The latter is more likely to ultimately appeal to people who identify as none of the above because they're disgusted with both parties.",english,2016-10-31T19:56:35.868+02:00,frontpagemag.com,US,34811,Independents Tilt Decisively to Trump,0,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/hillary_clinton3_3_2.jpg?itok=gjjQHTJr,0,1,0,0,0,hate,Neutral

Bruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. 
The chorus of NeverTrumpers is wailing ever louder as election day and Hillary¡¯s supposed victory approach. After more than a year of complaining about Trump crashing their political soiree, the Republicans attacking Trump still don¡¯t seem to get how their own behavior contributed to the perception that they are out-of-touch elites disdainful of the Republican masses. 
A recent example comes from premier NeverTrumper Bret Stephens of the Wall Street Journal . In his column Stephens bids farewell to a Republican Party stupid enough to nominate Trump, contrasting it with his imagined Golden Age of Republican policy excellence that Trump and his followers have destroyed. One policy in particular, immigration, reveals the distance between the political and pundit elite and the voting masses that helped make Trump the nominee: 
At a 1980 Republican primary debate in Houston, candidates George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan were asked whether the children of illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public schools for free. Mr. Bush said they should. ¡°We¡¯re creating a whole society of really honorable, decent, family-loving people that are in violation of the law,¡± he lamented. 
Reagan agreed. Instead of ¡°putting up a fence,¡± he asked, ¡°why don¡¯t we . . . make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit, and then, while they¡¯re working and earning here, they pay taxes here.¡± For good measure, Reagan suggested we should ¡°open the border both ways.¡± 
Where, in the populist fervor to build a wall with Mexico and deport millions of human beings, is that Republican Party today? 
Take Bush senior¡¯s statement first. It repeats basically the same clich¨¦s that the bipartisan Gang of Eight recycled in 2013 during their push for Comprehensive Immigration Reform, another euphemism for amnesty. All those hard-working, family-values illegal immigrants are embryonic conservatives, we were told, who just need legal status and social recognition so they can ¡°come out of the shadows,¡± as John McCain said, and start voting Republican. The political apple doesn¡¯t fall far from the tree: son Jeb ended his presidential ambitions by calling illegal immigration an ¡°act of love.¡± 
This stance on illegal immigration by Republican politicos and pundits is obviously light-years from the experience and position of many ordinary people. Take McCain¡¯s oft-repeated trope of ¡°living in the shadows.¡± Seriously? Illegal alien young people openly protest on live television, knowing they are not going to be deported. Millions visit emergency rooms for free, and wrangle food stamps, welfare transfers, school lunches, and all sorts of largess, all the while they live protected by ¡°sanctuary cities.¡± And ¡°living in the shadows¡± doesn¡¯t deter them from committing felonies, given that even if caught, convicted, and deported, they¡¯ll soon be back. Remember Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, the illegal alien deported five times, who murdered Kate Steinle? Or Angel Gilberto Garcia-Avalos, another five-time deportee who just this month started a $61 million fire in Sequoia National Park? He had just been released from the Kern County Jail, but could not be deported because of California¡¯s lunatic sanctuary city law, which prohibits a sheriff from contacting federal agents. 
Simply repeating the ¡°hard-working, family values, religious¡± mantra doesn¡¯t address the problems of illegal immigration. There are such illegal immigrants, as I know from over sixty years of personal experience living in the San Joaquin Valley, one of the largest concentrations of illegal aliens in the country. I grew up with Mexican-Americans, they¡¯re members of my immediate family, they¡¯re my friends, students, and colleagues. They¡¯re also the victims of the crimes and disorder caused by our porous border. 
Some illegals do transition into these sort of immigrants, but many do not. A rigorous vetting process might sort out the wheat from the chaff. But Bush, McCain, and Stephens have not proposed a workable, rigorous mechanism for determining who should stay and who should go. That means with any form of amnesty, citizenship will likely be granted indiscriminately, with only the most egregious felons sifted out, if any are stupid enough to apply for citizenship rather than continuing to ¡°live in the shadows.¡± But all those guilty of DUIs, hit-and-runs, or defrauding the welfare system with fake IDs will stay¨C¨Cand then bring their extended families under the provisions of the disastrous 1965 Immigration Act, which enshrined ¡°family reunification,¡± with no limits on relatives of U.S. citizens. 
Equally tone-deaf is Stephens¡¯s bringing up Ronald Reagan¡¯s ¡°open the border both ways.¡± That¡¯s exactly what he did in 1986 when he signed the Simpson-Mazzoli Act, which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, with promises of ¡°border enforcement¡± that never materialized. Stephens doesn¡¯t mention that as a result, the number of illegal immigrants increased from about 3 million to 11 million, creating today¡¯s crisis. The obvious lesson is secure the border first, then figure out what to do with the 11 million. It would be governmental malfeasance to repeat Reagan¡¯s mistake. 
The problem with politicians and pundits like Stephens is they don¡¯t live with the consequences of indiscriminately letting in people from very different cultures and mores. People like Stephens don¡¯t live daily with the disorder and crime that results. They¡¯re not aware of the extensive damage to quality of life, the illegal immigration version of ¡°broken windows,¡± such as dogs without rabies shots running free, health and safety codes ignored, building codes shrugged off, garbage and refuse dumped everywhere, copper wire stolen from pumps and street lights, and chronic petty theft¨C¨Cand that¡¯s on top of stolen cars, hit-and-runs, driving without insurance, gang-banging, and dealing drugs. 
And if Mr. Stephens thinks I¡¯m just a nativist or xenophobe or racist, I dare him to visit the San Joaquin Valley. Better yet, let him bring his wife and children to live there for a month. Come and tour a hospital emergency room, a Social Security disability office, a public school, a county jail, and then wax lyrical about these ¡°honorable, decent, family-loving people.¡± It would take just a week for Mr. Stephens to develop a ¡°fervor¡± for a five-foot high wall around his house, and buy four or five pit bulls and a shotgun. Then again, he wouldn¡¯t last that long. Within a day he¡¯d scurry back to his nice, white, secure tony neighborhood where he doesn¡¯t have to pay the cost of his moral preening. 
And that hypocrisy is where Trump came from. In the perception of millions of voters¨C¨Cperceptions NeverTrumpers have fed so incessantly that they look a lot like reality¨C¨Cthe conservative politicians and pundits care more about their privileged status and purity of principle than they do about the welfare and interests of their party¡¯s voters. And so they would rather see a venal, perjurious, corrupt mediocrity become Obama 2.0 and continue the progressive destruction of the Constitutional order, than see elected the nominee of their own party.

We have been very, very suspicious of Donald Trump since he began his political run. 
Many believed he was an outsider who was our ¡°only hope¡± to tame the US federal government beast. But it has become very clear he is not. 
First, Wikileaks showed that Killary herself actually approved Trump to be her competitor. According to an email sent from an assistant at the Clinton campaign, Hillary was aware that Trump was going to run before the political process was fully underway. 
Clinton advised the mainstream media to push his legitimacy as a ¡°pied piper¡± candidate because she realized, after looking at the poll numbers, that she wouldn¡¯t stand a chance at winning the presidency against any of the establishment republicans without making them ¡°pied pipers¡± ¨C it just so happened that Donald was the easiest to play the role considering his long history of friendship with the Clintons. 
In addition, the mainstream media was more than complicit in creating a narrative that the 2016 presidential elections were about Hillary Clinton vs Donald Trump from the get go. 
But, barely reported in the media, was that after the 3rd presidential debate, Clinton and Trump went out for a night on the town together¡­ and where they went is of great interest. 
They went to an annual Jesuit function which is usually full of New World Order types. 
THE JESUITS 
One of the more interesting things that occurred right at the end of the Jubilee year in early October, was that the Jesuits installed a new Superior General, with the date to commence being actually at midnight on the end of Jubilee. 
We found this interesting because there is plenty of evidence that the Jesuits are at least one major arm of what you can call the illuminati. 
In fact, the Jesuits were founded in Spain by what various reports call ¡°crypto Jews¡± ¨C those who are Jewish but pretending to be Catholic. Certainly at that time in Spain it was safer not to be a Jew. 
Even Wikipedia, which wouldn¡¯t recognize a conspiracy if it were directly presented by its participants has this to say about the Jesuits: 
¡­ In the first 30 years of the existence of the Society of Jesus there were many Jesuit conversos (Catholic-convert Jews) including the second Father General Diego Lainez ¡­ The original founder Ignatius ¡­ said that he, ¡°would take it as a special grace from our Lord to come from Jewish lineage.¡± 
At the beginning of the Al Smith dinner party after Cardinal Dolan was introduced, a joke was even made by a speaker that ¡°everyone in attendance is doing their part in supporting their charitable efforts and that it couldn¡¯t be done without the support of many of the other devoted ¡°Catholics¡± on stage like Henry Kissinger, Howard Rubenstein, and Mort Zuckerman¡± ¨C all of whom are obviously Jewish so this remark was naturally met with a lot of laughter¡­ 
In fact, an extraordinary amount of controversy swirls around Jesuits. They are said to constitute the ¡°Black Church¡± and thus adhere to the same Satanic religion as the world¡¯s elite bankers supposedly hold. 
The leader of the Jesuit order is commonly recognized in conspiratorial circles as the ¡°Black Pope¡± whose signature staff is a crooked cross. Historically, the Jesuit Order has been seen as one that shirks no crime in expanding the power of the Church. 
Lest this sound entirely outrageous, one must note that the Jesuits are, for instance, the inventors of concentration camps, which they established in Paraguay in order to incarcerate and then torture the native indians of the area. 
But the litany of attributed Jesuit evil is even darker than that according to those who believe in the order¡¯s continued malicious pursuit. The supposed founder of the Bavarian-based Illuminati, Adam Weishaupt, was a Jesuit. 
In fact, the order is reputed to have been deeply involved in the Illuminati¡¯s initial expansion, and chances are it is still deeply involved. 
One more thing that highlights the evil of the Jesuits is their extreme oath of induction which all superiors must take in order to be elevated to the higher rungs of the organization. This is taken from the book Subterranean Rome by Carlos Didier, translated from the French, and published in New York in 1843 and reads in part, 
¡°¡­promise and declare that I will, when opportunity present, make and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, as I am directed to do, to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex or condition; and that I will hang, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants¡¯ heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever their execrable race. That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poniard or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus¡­¡± 
One of the most poignant quotes regarding the malevolence of the Jesuits comes from Marquis de LaFayette 1757-1834; who was a French statesman and general who served in the American Continental Army under the command of General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War. 
His quote is as follows: 
¡°It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country ¨C the United States of America ¨C are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe.¡± 
THE BIG BASH 
When evaluating Jesuit behavior and influence, please keep in mind that both Donald Trump and Hillary¡¯s VP, Tim Kaine, are Jesuit educated. And it should be of GREAT interest, therefore, that practically on the eve of the US election, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton partied the night away at a Jesuit function that included such prominent Jesuit-trained attendees as Henry Kissinger. 
Not only did the two not look like sworn enemies¡­ they looked like two star crossed lovers going to their first prom. 
We have long held to our stance that Killary will be the next President of the US. The amount of vote rigging, murders and shenanigans to even get her to where she is so far has been tremendous¡­ and it won¡¯t stop. 
That said, if by some fluke, and the Diebold machines malfunction or people in the US wake up slightly and Donald Trump gets elected¡­ it is pretty clear they are on the same team and, as we¡¯ve said previously, nothing major will change. 
So, if you were hoping that this election could change things in the US¡­ get over that hope right now. It might change things, but only for the much, much worse. 
This charade is being played right in front of everyone¡¯s eyes and most do not understand what is happening or why jokes like the ¡°Catholic¡± joke is actually funny to these elite people. 
They are laughing at the peasants stupidity and lack of understanding, not because the men mentioned are Jews¡­ anyone with half a brain knows that. 
But while they laugh, we¡¯ll be laughing all the way to the bank ourselves. Just because these sick people are formulating diabolical plans to enslave humanity doesn¡¯t mean we can¡¯t profit from their planned chaos. It¡¯s better than sitting back in ignorance and making nothing. 
Our analysis of these elite¡¯s occult timelines which began with the Shemitah and culminated with the Jubilee, have helped us to accumulate around a 200% collective return on our portfolio in the last year.

Donald Trump is going to be the next president &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#655?33;&#65533; at least according to one pretty accurate election model.This assertion isn't a surprise. In February, the model's creator, Helmut Norpoth, gave Trump a 97 percent chance of becoming No. 45 if he got the GOP nomination, though the model now gives Trump an 87 percent chance.Norpoth's model predicts general election results based on how the candidate does in his or her party's primary. Norpoth applied the model to past elections and says it worked for every presidential election except one since 1912.""My feeling always has been, what I saw in the primaries, was that Donald Trump did very well,"" Norpoth said. ""He beat a large field. According to my metric about how primaries are shaping up, he did better than Hillary Clinton in the Democratic race, so that gave him a leg up.""There are a couple of issues with this. Usually, candidates shift their message after the primary to appeal to voters outside their base. Trump isn't doing that. His speeches haven't changed much, if at all, and he's not really bringing anyone new into his tent.Also, the model doesn't factor in anything that's actually happening in the country at the time. And factors like the economy, the incumbent president's approval numbers and the country's demographics all affect how people cast their vote in November.Outside of Norpoth's model, basically every other measurement out there shows Donald Trump's chance of winning 270 electoral votes is super slim. But, hey, this is 2016, and if we've learned anything, it's that there is nothing normal about this election cycle.

[10/27/16] Republican nominee Donald Trump is now within striking distance of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Michigan, a state that has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. 
In the latest Fox 2 Detroit/Mitchell Poll , Trump trails Clinton by just six points. In the four-way poll, Clinton received 48 percent, Trump received 42 percent, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received 4.5 percent, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 1 percent. Clinton led Trump 50 percent to 44 percent, in the head-to-head. 
Fifty-nine percent of polled voters said that jobs and the economy are the most important issues, while 29 percent said that national defense and terrorism were most important. 
A Detroit Free Press/WXYZ-TV poll places Clinton ahead of Trump by 7 points, which is still a significant narrowing compared to previous polls. 
Public backlash against trade deals like President Barack Obama¡¯s Tran-Pacific Partnership ¨C a deal that Clinton once called ¡°the gold standard in trade agreements¡±¨C was so fierce that Clinton changed her tune during the Democratic primary where she was defeated by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. 
¡°Across Michigan, Republicans are coming home and taking a united stand against Hillary Clinton¡¯s radical, open-borders agenda and plan to double-down on failed Obama policies, such as Obamacare. We are also seeing independents, Democrats and union workers saying no to Clinton¡¯s special interest driven agenda, and yes to Mr. Trump¡¯s plan to put America first,¡± Tim Lineberger, communications director for Trump¡¯s Michigan campaign team told The Daily Caller News Foundation. 
¡°Hard working Americans will be voting for change in November because they feel like the system is rigged against them, and they know that Clinton and her cohorts are the ones rigging it,¡± Lineberger added. 
Clinton was previously caught on tape telling a group of foreign bankers that her dream was a ¡°hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.¡± Trump is also hoping to capitalize on the government¡¯s recent report, stating that the price of Obamacare premiums are expected to increase an average of 22 percent.

Even Republican politicians and former politicians are telling Trump to knock off such talk . 
But, as usual, Trump¡¯s shrewdness and defiance of standard political decorum ¨C in which the ¡°opposition¡± party merely rolls over and surrenders in the face of Democratic pressure ¨C is winning the day. 
None other than billionaire investor and longtime Democratic supporter George Soros has said that the fix is literally in for the election, in favor of Clinton ¨C no matter how much of the popular vote, and from which battleground states, Trump captures. 
As reported by Top Right News and other outlets, during a recent interview with Bloomberg News , Soros ¨C a Democrat mega-donor ¨C openly admitted that Trump will win the popular vote in a ¡°landslide.¡± 
However, he said that none of that would matter, because a President Hillary Clinton is already a ¡°done deal.¡± 
In the interview, which is now going viral, Soros says with certainty that Trump will take the popular vote, despite what the polls say now (which are completely rigged to oversample Democrats ), but not the Electoral College, which will go to Clinton. 
When the reporter asks if that is already a ¡°done deal¡± ¨C that Clinton will be our next president no matter what ¨C Soros says ¡°yes,¡± and nods his head. 
Is Soros just making a prediction out of overconfidence? Or does he truly know something most of us don¡¯t know? 
In a recent column , Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, says that Soros and Democrats have ¡°bribed electoral college representatives¡± in a bid to ¡°fix¡± the election outcome in favor of Clinton. In truth, that would be the only way it could be done, short of massive voter fraud through electronic balloting, as some reports have already claimed . 
Adams further pointed out that Soros was one of the main money men behind the Black Lives Matter movement, which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country ¨C some of which has led to the deaths of several officers already. 
Soros also funds left-wing websites and groups that locate, pay and deploy volunteer ¡°agitators¡± at Trump rallies, to start fights and engage in physical violence against Trump supporters (acts that the establishment media then blames on Trump ). 
But aren¡¯t electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that elector¡¯s district? No, they¡¯re not. Nine-nine percent of electors have done what they¡¯re supposed to do throughout our history, but this is no ordinary election 
Per Archives.gov , there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote. Rather, these pledges fall into two categories: State law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political parties. 
In the past, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution doesn¡¯t require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please and, therefore, respective political parties may ¡°extract pledges from electors to vote for the parties¡¯ nominees,¡± Archives.gov notes. Some state laws hold that ¡°faithless electors¡± could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid ballot, and could then be replaced by a substitute elector. 
¡°The Supreme Court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the Constitution. No Elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged,¡± said Archives.gov. 
The site notes that throughout our history, 99 percent of electors have voted as required. But this is no ordinary time, and it¡¯s no ordinary election . And Democrats (and the establishment media) have already proven that they will do anything to stop a Trump presidency. Plus, establishment Republicans don¡¯t want Trump either, so you can bet they wouldn¡¯t balk at or challenge the buying off of electors.

MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, the founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. 
The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democrat and Republican Primaries. 
Data such as engagement with tweets or Facebook Live videos have been taken into account. The result is that Trump has overtaken the engagement numbers of Barack Obama¡¯s peak in 2008 ¨C the year he came into power ¨C by 25 percent. 
Rai said that his AI system shows that candidate in each election who had leading engagement data ended up winning the elections.

Jews are truly racist. M Saurette 
so, the plan is to be more violent, more racist, more destructive. And the goal is to have blacks NOT be targeted by police? Good luck with that. owr 
It won¡¯t just be the police targeting rioting blacks.The average white is ready fearfully cautious of black thugs. The thugs know this and they try to intimidate whites by flaunting theirs MTV image of the ¡®Gangsta¡¯ by learning the right facial expressions, and wearing their pants on their ass. Stacking gang signs, even if not in a gang to appear knowledgeable about such things. It might work with some of the girls, but to the average young white male it is perceived as a potential threat. The primary difference between white males and black males is that only 30%, on average, black males are not convicted felons, and cannot legally possess a firearm. On the other hand nearly 80% of white males have no felony conviction, and can, or do possess legal firearms. Blacks are 13% of our population. Whites are a little under 70%. There are also a huge number of pissed off white veterans of Vietnam, Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan, who would not mind a little domestic house cleaning. You can bet your ass, and not be afraid of losing it, that these Vets are Trump supporters. Be careful what you wish for. The real world is not MTV, or a gangsta movie. Cornczech 
This morning on my walk to the Howard Redline stop in the Rogers Park neighborhood in Chicago, IL¡­..I was called out to by a black woman: ¡°Hey, F* YOU, White B#tch!¡± The sad part, because I had to stop acting and looking scared a few years back when I first MOVED to this hood, (sometime after Obama became King), is that I am USED to this kind of thing, so I started to giggle after that outburst¡­yes, the abuse got worse ¡­but¡­I get this at least once a week when I walk to the store, to the EL¡­.to the bank¡­¡­so (shrug). 
I have never called a black man or woman a nigger¡­(I bet I get blasted or removed or censored for that¡­but I get called whitey, hillbilly¡­(I¡¯m a Cracker, let¡¯s get THAT straight!), and a myriad of other race specific names¡­..I have even been assaulted for being white and standing up for myself¡­(I am a female, by the way¡­.so, I have OTHER stories about my lovely experience living in CHICAGO¡­the next Detroit¡­.) 
So how am I a racist? I grew up in Texas and never had problems or saw violence..or had violence perpetrated against me¡­..since I came here¡­ 
So tell me again how I am a racist? 
My LAST question is: WHEN DID AMERICA come to such a SAD STATE? owr 
My suggestion is to get out of Chicago, it will be a pure hell-hole in the coming depression. Go back to Texas, the economy is much better there, and race relations are as well. Ted Dura

Actually the ¡®good fences make good neighbors¡¯ tendency toward self segregation followed by more or less peaceful voluntary trade appears more or less universal, and it¡¯s only the radical liberal cultural Marxism nonesense that is making this unworkable in the west (and this is mostly to blame on the mechanations of one particular tribe that¡¯s ¡®white¡¯ when it benefits them but who hold no actual allegiance to the white race, we all know who they are.) doodaa 
Do you think maybe ¡°GOD¡± knew what he was doing when he segregated races by continents? Jo Peter 
That is certainly a valid way to look at it. Some people view the order of the universe as through an impersonal ¡®nature¡¯ force, and others consider it a conscious design by an intelligent creator. In the end there is little practical difference when it comes to the specifics like this, since either way it worked before we broke it.

AMEN !!! Sanders was born and raised in the New York City borough of Brooklyn and graduated from the University of CHICAGO in 1964. While a student, he was an active civil rights protest organizer for the CONGRESS OF RACIAL EQUALITY and STUDENT (not really)NONVIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE. Bernie ran to Vermont in 1968, to get away from BLACKS to raise HIS family in SAFETY Sanders switched PARTIES, BETRAYED the Veterans, and instigates the Blacks and then RUNS AWAY. In January 1962, Sanders led a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Wells Beadle¡¯s segregated campus housing policy. ¡°We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments,¡± Sanders said at the protest.

To help payoff my student-loans I worked as a NYC teacher in ¡°troubled¡± neighborhoods for ten years. During those ten years I saw delinquents call each other ¡°niggas¡± hundreds of times every single school day. If I had done it once, I would have been fired that same day. They punched each other, stole from each other, and from the faculty, vandalized the school, threw brand new text books out the window but the state and federal funds continued to pour in, very much contrary to popular belief. 
They actually got more money then the nicer areas. When I was finally able to move to a ¡°good¡± school district, I couldn¡¯t believe it. When I told the children (99% Caucasians) to take a a book and read quietly they actually did it. No exaggeration, you good actually hear your own respiration, that¡¯s how quiet it was!!! And yes, you can find some schools with 95-99% white student population. I was never a ¡°racist¡± but this was too much. The difference is incredible!!! Unfortunately if you notice a obvious behavioral difference between races, you are labeled as some kind of a bad person and the general public has learned to accept this word ¡°racist¡± as derogatory regardless of the evidences that may exist, and we all know that they do exist. This denial has successfully forced illogical integration, the destruction of our liberty and country and the rise of economic fascist billionaires. Donald Trump, the only billionaire to go against is fellow elites is being completely typecast as ¡°the rich white guy that must be a racist.¡± He is probably the one and only chance the middle class and the poor class will ever see again for justice in this country. The last man to have had his courage was President JFK. owr 
To actually be a nigger, one must learn to be one. They have plenty of role models to copy. It¡¯s a matter of choice. nobody

What government really fears is when other than people of color, were to take to the streets. That¡¯s why the government and the controlled media hide the truth about crime, racist crime perpetrated against other than people of color. When other than people of color awakens to the truth about crimes against them, L.A., Ferguson, and riots of their kind would pale against the response levied against the government for allowing the crimes against other than people of color to continue as it does today. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 DOES NOT offer any protection for other than people of color. That¡¯s NOT was it was passed for! Other than people of color have NO federal or state protections against prejudice, injustice and inequality. nightwisp 
The 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 made their rights equal to the white man. If the white man is gone, they are equal to nothing. They will have no rights. owr

That would be instant death for the 3/5th¡¯s, 14th amendment black United States citizens. This country was created by old white men to protect the white race. This is why the Jewish run media are promoting the blacks to riot. In fact black folks if your going to go after a group you might want to think about going after the Jews in the media. As they¡¯re the one¡¯s that have set you up to fail. Here¡¯s a sweet piece of history the majority of the Negroes don¡¯t know. Israel Cohen, the General Secretary of the World Zionist Organization, in his 1912 book ¡°A racial program for the 20th Century¡±. And, read into the Congressional Record by Congressman Thomas Abernathy, U.S. House of Representatives Mississippi, 4th District on June 7, 1957, Volume 103, top of page 8559: Israel Cohen penned ¡°We must realize that our party¡¯s most powerful weapon is racial tension. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by the whites, we can mould them to the program of Negro minority against the whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the Negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.¡± So black folks before you embark on a suicide mission learn some real history and the true cause of your plight. As your anger is miss directed and you will be engaged as belligerents and enemy combatants. Live in peace, be well, and do your homework before you attempt something rash and dangerous. Rick

[10/28/16] Triggered journalists from across the nation are bemoaning the treatment members of the press are receiving at Trump campaign rallies from the Trump supporters the media routinely misrepresents as ignorant racists, fascist Nazis, or disenchanted working whites. 
With increasing regularity, these journalist snowflakes are ¡°reporting¡± their victimization at the hands Trump supporters who chant mean things like, ¡°CNN sucks¡± and call them names like ¡°presstitutes.¡± 
For members of the media elite, the occasional taunts and jeers signal a dangerous threat to the free press. During an interview with Kellyanne Conway on Tuesday, CNN¡¯s Wolf Blitzer breathlessly asked Trump¡¯s campaign manager to ask Trump to stop calling out the press at his rallies because he is scared ¡°there could be an ugly incident¡± between Trump supporters and the ¡°hardworking young journalists¡± who cover his rallies. 
A quick review of media stories over the last two weeks reveals more than a dozen articles in major publications with the same ¡°journalists victimized by Trump supporters at rallies¡± narrative. Trump supporters endure long waits, messy parking, and often obstructed view seating to rally for their candidate. The press, on the other hand, is given their own entrance, sectioned off seating, and protection from event security and the Secret Service. 
After an exhaustive search, this Breitbart reporter could find exactly zero incidences of members of the media being physically attacked or assaulted at Trump rallies. None of this has stopped the misleading characterization of Trump supporters creating a ¡°menacing¡± and ¡°dangerous¡± environment for these special snowflakes. 
The narrative sprung up briefly in August when NBC ¡®s Katy Tur wrote a long piece in Marie Claire in which she gives her account of her confrontational relationship with Trump and the backlash his ¡°insults¡± on her reporting created with his supporters. Here is a small piece from her ¡°no-holds-barred¡± account: 
I was six months into covering the Trump campaign for MSNBC and NBC News, and there I was, in the belly of a World War II battleship, in a press pen made out of bicycle racks, surrounded by thousands of whipped-up Trump supporters. 
¡­ 
Trump decided to go further in Mount Pleasant, pointing his finger squarely at me and launching a personal attack as millions of Americans watched at home. 
¡°What a lie it was,¡± Trump said, referring to the claim that he had left the stage abruptly. ¡°What a lie. Katy Tur. What a lie it was. Third. Rate. Reporter. Remember that.¡± The crowd¡¯s boos ricocheted off the iron hull of the USS Yorktown. 
Just a few days after the Tur piece was published, two other NBC press employees ¡ª Frank Thorp and Ali Vitali ¡ª tweeted out pictures and videos of Trump supporters showing insufficient deference to the press. It was so very traumatic that it inspired several stories, including this one in Real Clear Politics .

[10/29/16] Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized rival Hillary Clinton for her ¡°bad judgment¡± and warned about the consequences of her top aide¡¯s husband¡¯s online philandering. 
On Friday the FBI chose to continue its investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s unauthorized, unsecured email server stored in a bathroom closet and used to conduct official state business. Furthermore, the New York Times reported that the FBI had seized devices from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin¡¯s estranged husband, disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner, while they investigated his sexting of an underage girl. One official said the new emails related to Clinton¡¯s case numbered ¡°in the tens of thousands.¡± 
Weiner¡¯s penchant for sexting underage girls and sending them sexually explicit photos of himself now endangers Clinton¡¯s presidential run. 
Trump hammered Weiner for years before his presidential run, calling him ¡°degenerate¡± and ¡°sick.¡± 
Trump also warned underage girls against Weiner back in 2012 and 2013, years before news broke that Weiner had sexually explicit texts and Skype calls with a 15-year-old girl.

[11/1/16] MICHAEL SNYDER -Donald Trump has all the momentum now. Will it be enough to propel him to victory on election day? Trump¡¯s poll numbers were improving even before we learned that the FBI had renewed its investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s emails, and the new survey results that came out over the weekend and on Monday make it clear that Clinton¡¯s ¡°certain victory¡± is not so certain after all. Unless something changes, Americans are going to go to the polls on November 8th with an FBI criminal investigation hanging over the Clinton campaign like an ominous cloud, and that is very good news for Trump. 
The Clinton campaign was hoping that this renewed investigation would not ¡°move the needle¡±, but unfortunately for them that appears not to be the case. Hillary¡¯s unfavorable rating just hit an all-time high , a whopping 45 percent of all Americans believe that this scandal is ¡°worse than Watergate¡±, and a Rasmussen survey has found that 40 percent of all undecided voters that are leaning toward voting for Hillary Clinton are still open to changing their minds before election day. 
And even before this story broke on Friday, Clinton was having a difficult time getting her voters to the polls. According to the New York Times , early voting among young adults and African-American voters is significantly down compared to 2012, and those are demographic groups that Clinton desperately needs to turn out in large numbers. 
But of course the key to winning the election is getting to 270 electoral votes, and poll numbers appear to be shifting in the key swing states that Trump and Clinton both desperately need. For a moment, I would like to examine what the numbers currently look like in some of the most important states¡­ 
Florida 
Without Florida, Donald Trump has absolutely no chance of winning. This is something that even the Trump campaign has admitted. That is why it was so alarming that most of the polls in October had Hillary Clinton leading in the state. 
Fortunately for Trump, a new survey that was conducted on Sunday shows him leading in Florida by four points . 
Georgia 
Georgia wasn¡¯t supposed to be a problem. Georgia has traditionally been a deep red state, but polling throughout this election season had shown a very tight race. This had Republicans deeply concerned and the Clinton camp very happy. 
But now the momentum has seemingly shifted and the latest poll has Trump up by seven points . 
North Carolina 
Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, and Donald Trump very much needs to win it if he hopes to be triumphant on November 8th. Hillary Clinton was shown to be leading in the eight most recent polls before the email story broke, but in the first major survey conducted afterwards she is now down by two points . 
Ohio 
No Republican has ever won the presidency without Ohio, and Trump knows how important it is to his chances. The three most recent polls conducted before the FBI renewed the investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s emails all showed a tie, but now the very first survey conducted afterwards shows Trump up by five points . 
Colorado 
Hillary Clinton has consistently been in the lead in Colorado throughout this campaign, and most experts didn¡¯t give Trump much of a chance in the state, but the latest survey shows that Clinton¡¯s lead has been whittled down to just one point . 
Arizona 
A survey that was conducted in mid-October showed Clinton having a five point lead in John McCain¡¯s home state, but now the latest major poll has Trump up by two points . 
Nevada 
One of the most important swing states out west is Nevada, and most surveys showed Hillary Clinton with a strong lead throughout the month of October. Unfortunately for her, a poll that was conducted on Sunday shows Donald Trump with a four point lead . 
Clearly Trump has the momentum at this point, and it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change over the next few days. 
And as we learn more about what is in these newly discovered emails, will her fellow Democrats stick with her? Already, some are publicly wavering. The following example comes from WND ¡­ 
Longtime Clinton confidante and former Democratic pollster Doug Schoen told Fox News the newly renewed FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s private email server is forcing him to ¡°reassess¡± his support for the Democratic nominee for president. 
Schoen, a Fox News contributor, made the comments to host Harris Faulkner during a live television appearance Sunday night on ¡°Fox Report Weekend.¡± 
Public opinion is shifting quickly, but the bad news for Trump is that more than 23 million Americans have already voted. So millions upon millions of Americans cast their votes before they even learned of this new FBI investigation. If the race is very close, that could end up making the difference. 
And of course the race could dramatically change once again if the FBI comes to some sort of resolution about these new emails prior to November 8th. On Monday, CNN reported that a resolution before election day did not appear to be likely¡­ 
FBI officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to its investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s private server before the November 8 election. 
The initial work of cataloging top Clinton aide Huma Abedin¡¯s emails found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner¡¯s laptop could be done in the next few days, US law enforcement officials told CNN. 
But the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other work, including likely working with other federal agencies to determine what ¡ª if any ¡ª classified materials are in the emails. This makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election. 
However, late on Monday evening the Drudge Report reported that the L.A. Times has learned that investigators may have a ¡°preliminary assessment¡± completed ¡°in coming days¡±¡­ 
LA TIMES TUESDAY: FBI Investigators had planned to conduct new email review over several weeks. It now hopes to complete ¡®preliminary assessment¡¯ in coming days, but agency officials have not decided how, or whether, they will disclose results publicly¡­ Developing¡­ 
Whether good or bad, I do believe that the American people deserve to hear something conclusive about these emails before November 8th. 
If nothing is found to implicate Clinton, the American people should be told that. 
And if evidence of very serious crimes is discovered, there is no way in the world that should be held back until after the election. 
Even if it throws the election into complete and utter chaos , the American people deserve to know the truth. 
But will we get it? 
Stay tuned, because I think that this is going to be a crazy week.

[11/3/16] Now that her coronation appears to be escaping her grasp, Democrat Party presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton is showing another side of her personality . On Tuesday night a heckler interrupted her speech, waving a sign that read ¡°Bill Clinton is a rapist.¡± Her response, instead of showing her usual controlled aplomb and restraint, surprised the crowd at its intensity and ferocity. Pointing at the offender and shouting at the top of her voice, Clinton exploded: 
I¡¯m sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior of people who support Donald Trump! 
The protestor was immediately led away and his sign was torn apart. It turned out that the protestor was vying for a cash prize being offered by Alex Jones of InfoWars.com to anyone appearing either on television or at a Clinton rally chanting ¡°Bill Clinton is a rapist¡± and wearing a t-shirt bearing the same slogan. 
NBC News tried to downplay the interruption, noting that while other protestors have shown up at rallies featuring President Obama and Bill Clinton himself, they are bringing attention to ¡°decades-old allegations from three women who accuse Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. The former president has denied all of the allegations.¡± Post navigation",english,2016-11-04T01:07:43.462+02:00,govtslaves.info,US,,"HILLARY: ¡°I¡¯M SICK AND TIRED OF THE NEGATIVE, DARK, DIVISIVE, DANGEROUS VISION AND BEHAVIOR¡± OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS",0,http://www.govtslaves.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/maxresdefault-4-1.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

T he American journalist, Edward Bernays, is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho-analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term ¡°public relations¡± as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions. In 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade ¨C behaviour then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, ¡°Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!¡± Bernays¡¯ influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret, he said, was ¡°engineering the consent¡± of people in order to ¡°control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it¡±. He described this as ¡°the true ruling power in our society¡± and called it an ¡°invisible government¡±. Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. Imagine two cities. Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties. In the second city ¨C in another country nearby ¨C almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by ¡°us¡± ¨C by the United States and Britain. They even have a media centre that is funded by Britain and America. Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys, condemned for assaulting and bombing the city ¨C which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city. Confusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad. W hat is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today. Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was ¡°vindicated¡± for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell¡¯s fabrications. The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, ¡°What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?¡± He replied that if journalists had done their job, ¡°there is a very, very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq¡±. It was a shocking statement, and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question ¡ª Dan Rather of CBS, David Rose of the Observer and journalists and producers in the BBC, who wished to remain anonymous. In other words, had journalists done their job, had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children would be alive today, and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul. There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on 7 th July 2005. There would have been no flight of millions of refugees; there would be no miserable camps. When the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November, President Francois Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria ¨C and more terrorism followed, predictably, the product of Hollande¡¯s bombast about France being ¡°at war¡± and ¡°showing no mercy¡±. That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak. ¡°When the truth is replaced by silence,¡± said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko, ¡°the silence is a lie.¡± The attack on Iraq, the attack on Libya, the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West. The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant. They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country. The same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an ¡°agreement¡± that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy. His people were bombed, and he was prosecuted in The Hague. Independence of this kind is intolerable. As WikiLeaks has revealed, it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, that he was attacked. From that moment, the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics ¨C the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage. Why is this not news? The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross, who was responsible for operating sanctions against Iraq, told me: ¡°We would feed journalists factoids of sanitised intelligence, or we would freeze them out. That is how it worked.¡± The West¡¯s medieval client, Saudi Arabia ¨C to which the US and Britain sell billions of dollars¡¯ worth of arms ¨C is at present destroying Yemen, a country so poor that in the best of times, half the children are malnourished. Look on YouTube and you will see the kind of massive bombs ¨C ¡°our¡± bombs ¨C that the Saudis use against dirt-poor villages, and against weddings, and funerals. The explosions look like small atomic bombs. The bomb aimers in Saudi Arabia work side-by-side with British officers. This fact is not on the evening news. Propaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education ¨C Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Columbia ¡ª and with careers on the BBC, the Guardia n, the New York Times , the Washington Post . These organisations are known as the liberal media. They present themselves as enlightened, progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist. They are anti-racist, pro-feminist and pro-LGBT. And they love war. While they speak up for feminism, they support rapacious wars that deny the rights of countless women, including the right to life. In 2011, Libya, then a modern state, was destroyed on the pretext that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit genocide on his own people. That was the incessant news; and there was no evidence. It was a lie. In fact, Britain, Europe and the United States wanted what they like to call ¡°regime change¡± in Libya, the biggest oil producer in Africa. Gaddafi¡¯s influence in the continent and, above all, his independence were intolerable. So he was murdered with a knife in his rear by fanatics, backed by America, Britain and France. Hillary Clinton cheered his gruesome death for the camera, declaring, ¡°We came, we saw, he died!¡± The destruction of Libya was a media triumph. As the war drums were beaten, Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian : ¡°Though the risks are very real, the case for intervention remains strong.¡± Intervention ¡ª what a polite, benign, Guardian word, whose real meaning, for Libya, was death and destruction. According to its own records, Nato launched 9,700 ¡°strike sorties¡± against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. They included missiles with uranium warheads. Look at the photographs of the rubble of Misurata and Sirte, and the mass graves identified by the Red Cross. The Unicef report on the children killed says, ¡°most [of them] under the age of ten¡±. As a direct consequence, Sirte became the capital of ISIS. Ukraine is another media triumph. Respectable liberal newspapers such as the New York Times , the Washington Post and the Guardian , and mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC, NBC, CBS, CNN have played a critical role in conditioning their viewers to accept a new and dangerous cold war. All have misrepresented events in Ukraine as a malign act by Russia when, in fact, the coup in Ukraine in 2014 was the work of the United States, aided by Germany and Nato. This inversion of reality is so pervasive that Washington¡¯s military intimidation of Russia is not news; it is suppressed behind a smear and scare campaign of the kind I grew up with during the first cold war. Once again, the Ruskies are coming to get us, led by another Stalin, whom The Economist depicts as the devil. The suppression of the truth about Ukraine is one of the most complete news blackouts I can remember. The fascists who engineered the coup in Kiev are the same breed that backed the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Of all the scares about the rise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe, no leader ever mentions the fascists in Ukraine ¨C except Vladimir Putin, but he does not count. Many in the Western media have worked hard to present the ethnic Russian-speaking population of Ukraine as outsiders in their own country, as agents of Moscow, almost never as Ukrainians seeking a federation within Ukraine and as Ukrainian citizens resisting a foreign-orchestrated coup against their elected government. There is almost the joie d¡¯esprit of a class reunion of warmongers. The drum-beaters of the Washington Post inciting war with Russia are the very same editorial writers who published the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. To most of us, the American presidential campaign is a media freak show, in which Donald Trump is the arch villain. But Trump is loathed by those with power in the United States for reasons that have little to do with his obnoxious behaviour and opinions. To the invisible government in Washington, the unpredictable Trump is an obstacle to America¡¯s design for the 21 st century. This is to maintain the dominance of the United States and to subjugate Russia, and, if possible, China. To the militarists in Washington, the real problem with Trump is that, in his lucid moments, he seems not to want a war with Russia; he wants to talk with the Russian president, not fight him; he says he wants to talk with the president of China. In the first debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump promised not to be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into a conflict. He said, ¡°I would certainly not do first strike. Once the nuclear alternative happens, it¡¯s over.¡± That was not news. Did he really mean it? Who knows? He often contradicts himself. But what is clear is that Trump is considered a serious threat to the status quo maintained by the vast national security machine that runs the United States, regardless of who is in the White House. The CIA wants him beaten. The Pentagon wants him beaten. The media wants him beaten. Even his own party wants him beaten. He is a threat to the rulers of the world ¨C unlike Clinton who has left no doubt she is prepared to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and China. Clinton has the form, as she often boasts. Indeed, her record is proven. As a senator, she backed the bloodbath in Iraq. When she ran against Obama in 2008, she threatened to ¡°totally obliterate¡± Iran. As Secretary of State, she colluded in the destruction of governments in Libya and Honduras and set in train the baiting of China. She has now pledged to support a No Fly Zone in Syria ¡ª a direct provocation for war with Russia. Clinton may well become the most dangerous president of the United States in my lifetime ¨Ca distinction for which the competition is fierce. Without a shred of evidence, she has accused Russia of supporting Trump and hacking her emails. Released by WikiLeaks, these emails tell us that what Clinton says in private, in speeches to the rich and powerful, is the opposite of what she says in public. That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders. Today, the greatest build-up of American-led forces since World War Two is under way ¨C in the Caucasus and eastern Europe, on the border with Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, where China is the target. Keep that in mind when the presidential election circus reaches its finale on November 8 th, If the winner is Clinton, a Greek chorus of witless commentators will celebrate her coronation as a great step forward for women. None will mention Clinton¡¯s victims: the women of Syria, the women of Iraq, the women of Libya. None will mention the civil defence drills being conducted in Russia. None will recall Edward Bernays¡¯ ¡°torches of freedom¡±. George Bush¡¯s press spokesman once called the media ¡°complicit enablers¡±. Coming from a senior official in an administration whose lies, enabled by the media, caused such suffering, that description is a warning from history. In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German media: ¡°Before every major aggression, they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically for the attack. In the propaganda system, it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons.¡± This is adapted from an address to the Sheffield Festival of Words, Sheffield, England.

That¡¯s what he thinks. I think it makes Trump better ¡ª the better choice ¡ª as opposed to the proven evil and catastrophically harmful public official, Hillary Clinton. Edlinger is preferring an evil record as a public official, to no record as a public official. Edlinger fails to make two crucial distinctions: One is that he fails to distinguish between mere political statements, versus actual political policies carried out as a public official (which show Hillary to be a proven neocon and tool of Wall Street); and the other is his failing to distinguish between a bad record in a person¡¯s private or business affairs, versus a bad record as an actual public official. Only the bad record as a public official should be absolutely disqualifying ¡ª and that¡¯s Clinton, not Trump, who has a horrific record as a public official. Trump has no record at all as a public official. Edlinger at 1:30 in his video says that when he contemplates voting for Hillary,¡±There¡¯s always one thing that comes in the way, and that¡¯s trust.¡± He says he doesn¡¯t trust her ¡ª but what he doesn¡¯t actually ¡°trust¡± is her words; when he says he¡¯ll vote for her, he¡¯s simply ignoring her actions, he¡¯s ignoring the real person-as-a-public-official, the person who is shown and displayed beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever. Proven selfishness in one¡¯s private life is bad, but proven selfishness and evil in one¡¯s public-office policies (such as ¡°We came, we saw, he died. Ha, ha!¡± ) is utterly disqualifying. I argued in my ¡°I¡¯m a Bernie Sanders Voter: Here¡¯s Why I¡¯ll Vote Trump¡± , that Trump could possibly turn out to be a progressive President; but, even if he turns out to be a bad President, he won¡¯t, on balance, be as horrific as will a President Hillary Clinton. With Trump, there is reason to have some hope for the future of the world; with Clinton, there is reason to expect unprecedented horrors .

Dixon W hen astute political commentary from a half century ago eloquently describes the current political conundrum it means we¡¯ve been stuck in a bad place for a long time. Do we really want Malcolm¡¯s observation to apply four or eight or twenty years further into the future? It¡¯s that time again, it¡¯s presidential election season, and as we hear every four years, THIS is the most important presidential election of our lives. The fact that you¡¯ve heard that before should tell us something. It should us that in presidential years, many old things becomes new again, often because so much of what we¡¯re told IS new is really pretty old. Malcolm X has been dead now a half century, dead for more years than he was ever alive. But since at least one of the tricks and traps deployed to fool, frustrate and neutralize our grandparents¡¯ right to vote hasn¡¯t changed much we might want to listen carefully to what Malcolm¡¯s words in the aftermath of the 1964 presidential election. ¡° If Johnson had been running all by himself, he would not have been acceptable to anyone. The only thing that made him acceptable to the world was that the shrewd capitalists, the shrewd imperialists, knew that the only way people would run toward the fox would be if you showed them a wolf. So they created a ghastly alternative. And it had the whole world ¡ª including people who call themselves Marxists ¡ª hoping that Johnson would beat Goldwater.¡± Like today¡¯s Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was a truly reprehensible and frightening figure, who had opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination in public accommodations, and who favored the use of nuclear weapons to defoliate the Vietnamese countryside. Also like Donald Trump, Goldwater never really stood a chance of winning the election. Goldwater the wolf was buried beneath a Johnson landslide, carrying only 6 out of the 50 states. Republican officeholders are running away from Donald Trump not because he¡¯s a racist bufoon but because he¡¯s expected to lose states Republicans are accustomed to winning. The fox, Lyndon Baines Johnson went on to start a war in Indochina that killed three million Vietnamese alone. LBJ defoliated the Vietnamese countryside with millions of tons of Agent Orange instead of nukes, causing hundreds of thousands of hideous and gruesome birth defects that continue to this day. The wolf and the fox this year are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Trump is a real estate con man, a racist and a hyper-entitled sexual predator who talks about building walls and banning Muslims. Fortunately for us all, Trump has never been in government. Hillary has scarcely ever been out of government. She¡¯s fronted for Wal-Mart, executed bloody regime change in Libya, brought US troops to Ukraine on the Russian border, and publicly itches for a showdown in Syria. Thanks to Wikileaks there is copious evidence that Hillary¡¯s public stands on a wide range of issues from charter schools to so-called trade agreements, to fracking and social security stand in stark contrast to the promises she makes to the powerful. Just as it worked 52 years ago, the overwhelming defeat of her wolvish opponent will give Hillary the appearance of a mandate. But the margin of Hillary¡¯s victory provides those of us on the left an unprecedented opportunity. It means there is no need for those who imagine themselves on the of jobs, justice, peace and the planet to ride to Hilllary¡¯s rescue and ensure the defeat of Donald Trump. Trump has already beaten himself. This election is our best chance to break out of the decades-old two party trap and build a new political force, a new political party. The Green Party is the only peace party, the only party that stands for people and planet over profit, and our only opportunity to vote our hopes, not our fears. It¡¯s time to choose. We vote Green and build Green, we can consign the political conundrum Malcolm X eloquently described a half century ago to the garbage can of history. Or we can vote for Hillary, and Malcolm¡¯s words will be as applicable four or eight years or twenty years from now as they have been for the last fifty. For Black Agenda Radio I¡¯m Bruce Dixon.

O n November 1st, The Intercept headlined ¡°HERE¡¯S THE PROBLEM WITH THE STORY CONNECTING RUSSIA TO DONALD TRUMP¡¯S EMAIL SERVER¡± , and the reporting team of Sam Biddle, Lee Fang, Micah Lee, and Morgan Marquis-Boire, revealed that: ¡°Slate¡¯s Franklin Foer published a story that¡¯s been circulating through the dark web and various newsrooms since summertime, an enormous, eyebrow-raising claim that Donald Trump uses a secret server to communicate with Russia. That claim resulted in an explosive night of Twitter confusion and misinformation. The gist of the Slate article is dramatic ¡ª incredible, even: Cybersecurity researchers found that the Trump Organization used a secret box configured to communicate exclusively with Alfa Bank, Russia¡¯s largest commercial bank. This is a story that any reporter in our election cycle would drool over, and drool Foer did.¡± 
The Intercept team concluded their detailed analysis of the evidence by saying: Franklin Foer is an American warmonger and p.r. agent, a Democrat, and former editor of The [scurrilous Neocon] New Republic. Foer was a 2012 Bernard L. Schwartz fellow at the New America Foundation. ¡°Could it be that Donald Trump used one of his shoddy empire¡¯s spam marketing machines, one with his last name built right into the domain name, to secretly collaborate with a Moscow bank? Sure. At this moment, there¡¯s literally no way to disprove that. But there¡¯s also literally no way to prove it, and such a grand claim carries a high burden of proof. Without more evidence it would be safer (and saner) to assume that this is exactly what it looks like: A company that Trump has used since 2007 to outsource his hotel spam is doing exactly that. Otherwise, we¡¯re all making the exact same speculation about the unknown that¡¯s caused untold millions of voters to believe Hillary¡¯s deleted emails might have contained Benghazi cover-up PDFs. Given equal evidence for both, go with the less wacky story.¡± 
However, they failed to dig deeper to explain what could have motivated this smear of Trump: was it just sloppiness on the part of Slate, and of Foer? Hardly ¡ª it was anything but unintentional: A core part of the Democratic Party¡¯s campaign for Hillary Clinton consists of her claim that Donald Trump is secretly a Russian agent. This is an updated version of the Republican Joseph R. McCarthy¡¯s campaign to ¡°root communists out of the federal government,¡± and of the John Birch Society¡¯s accusation even against the Republican President Dwight Eisenhower that, ¡°With regard to ¡­ Eisenhower, it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason.¡± 
Neoconservatives ¡ª in both Parties ¡ª are the heirs of the Republican Party¡¯s hard-right, which now, even decades after the 1991 end of communism and the Soviet Union, hate Russia above all of their other passions. Neoconservatism has emerged as today¡¯s Republican Party¡¯s Establishment, and (like with the Democratic Party¡¯s original neocon, U.S. Senator Henry ¡°Scoop¡± Jackson, the ¡°Senator from Boeing¡±) they¡¯ve always viewed Russia to be America¡¯s chief enemy, and they have favored the overthrow of any nation¡¯s leader who is friendly toward Russia, such as Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, Viktor Yanukovych, and Bashar al-Assad. Hatred and demonization of Russia is the common core of neoconservatism ¡ª the post-Cold-War extension of Joseph R. McCarthy and the John Birch Society. Neoconservatives ¡ª in both Parties ¡ª are the heirs of the Republican Party¡¯s hard-right, which now, even decades after the 1991 end of communism and the Soviet Union, hate Russia above all of their other passions. 
Both Slate and especially Foer have long pedigrees as Democratic Party neoconservatives ¡ª champions of U.S. invasions, otherwise called PR agents (¡®journalists¡¯) promoting the products and services that a few giant and exclusive military corporations such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Dyncorp, and the Carlyle Group, offer to the U.S. federal government. I¡¯ll deal here only with Foer, not with his latest employer (in a string, all of which are neocon Democratic ¡®news¡¯ media). Foer wrote in The New York Times , on 10 October 2004, against ¡®isolationist¡¯ Republicans, who regretted having supported George W. Bush¡¯s invasion of Iraq, and he headlined about them there, ¡°Once Again, America First¡± , equating non -neoconservative Republicans with, essentially, the pro-fascist isolationists of the 1930s. He concluded that they would come to regret their regret: ¡°Conservatives could soon find themselves retracing Buckley¡¯s steps, wrestling all over again with their isolationist instincts.¡± That¡¯s how far-right Franklin Foer is: he¡¯s to the right of those Republicans. .. On 7 June 2004, Foer, in a tediously long, badly written and argued, article in New York Magazine , ¡°The Source of the Trouble¡± , described the downfall of The New York Times¡¯s leading stenographer for George W. Bush¡¯s lies to invade Iraq, their reporter Judith Miller. He closed by concluding that ¡°the source of the trouble¡± was that Miller was simply too earnest and tried too hard ¡ª not that she was a stenographer to power: .. ¡°People like Miller, with her outsize journalistic temperament of ambition, obsession, and competitive fervor, relying on people like Ahmad Chalabi, with his smooth, affable exterior retailing false information for his own motives, for the benefit of people reading a newspaper, trying to get at the truth of what¡¯s what. ¡± .. (She was anything but ¡°trying to get at the truth of what¡¯s what.¡± She was the opposite: a mere stenographer to George W. Bush and to the Administration¡¯s chosen mouthpieces, such as the anti-Saddam exiled Iraqi Ahmad Chalaby.) O n 20 December 2004, when the question of whether to bomb Iran was being debated by neoconservatives, Foer, who then was the Editor of the leading Democratic Party neoconservative magazine, The New Republic , headlined in his magazine, ¡°Identity Crisis: Neocon v. Neocon on Iran¡± , and he introduced a supposed non-neocon from the supposedly non-neocon Brookings Institution, Kenneth Pollack, to comment upon the conflict among ( the other Party¡¯s ) neocons: ¡°In part, the lack of neocon consensus [on whether to, as John McCain was to so poetically put it, ¡®Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran¡¯ ] can be attributed to the nature of the problem. Nobody ¡ª not the Council on Foreign Relations, not John Kerry¡¯s brain trust ¡ª has designed a plausible policy to walk Iran back from the nuclear brink. Or, as Kenneth M. Pollack concludes in his new book, The Persian Puzzle, this is a ¡®problem from Hell¡¯ with no good solution.¡± But, actually, both Pollack and Brookings are Democratic Party neocons themselves; and among the leading proponents of invading Iraq had been not only Pollack but Brookings¡¯s Michael O¡¯Hanlon . Brookings had no prominent opponent of invading Iraq. (Brookings has a long history of neoconservatism , and routinely leads the Democratic Party¡¯s contingent of neocon thinking, even urging a Democratic administration to have its stooge-regimes violate international laws .) The real reason why neocons (being the heirs of the far-right extremists¡¯ Cold-War demonization of Russia, even after communism is gone) wanted to conquer both Iraq and Iran, was that both countries¡¯ leaders were friendly towards Russia, and were opposed by the Saud family who own Saudi Arabia, which family quietly worked not only with the U.S. government but with Israel¡¯s government, against both Iraq and Iran, as well as against Syria ¡ª those three nations (Iraq, Iran, and Syria) all being friendly toward Russia, which both the Saudi aristocracy, and not only the U.S. aristocracy, hate. It¡¯s not just the conservative ¡®news¡¯ media that are neoconservative now. The so-called ¡®liberal¡¯ media are so neoconservative that, for example, Salon can condemn Donald Trump for his having condemned Hillary and Obama¡¯s bombing of Libya. Salon condemned Trump¡¯s having said ¡°We would be so much better off if Qaddafi were in charge right now¡± ¡ª as if Trump weren¡¯t correct, and as if what happened after our overthrow and killing of Qaddafi weren¡¯t far worse for both Libyans and the world than what now exists in Libya. (But, of course, for Lockheed Martin etc., it is far better). CBS News and Mother Jones condemned the Trilateralist Joseph Nye for having veered temporarily away from his normal neoconservatism. Then, Nye wrote in the neocon Huffington Post saying that David Corn of Mother Jones and Franklin Foer of The New Republic had misrepresented what he had said, and that he was actually a good neocon after all. Nye closed: ¡°In any case, I have never supported Gaddafi and am on record wishing him gone, and also on record supporting Obama¡¯s actions in recent weeks. We now know that Gaddafi¡¯s departure is the only change that will work in Libya.¡± Sure, it did. Oh, really? It¡¯s Trump who is crazy here? More recently, Foer headlined at Slate, ¡°Putin¡¯s Puppet: If the Russian president could design a candidate to undermine American interests ¡ª and advance his own ¡ª he¡¯d look a lot like Donald Trump.¡± Foer proceeded to present the view of Trump that subsequently became parroted by the Hillary Clinton campaign (that Trump=traitor). Wikipedia has a 450-person ¡±List of Republicans opposing Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016¡å , and it¡¯s almost entirely comprised of well-known neoconservatives ¡ª the farthest-right of all Republicans, the people closest to Joseph R. McCarthy and the John Birch Society. Foer cited many neoconservative sources that are not commonly thought of as Republican, such as Buzzfeed; and he even had the gall to blame the Russian government for having made public its best evidence behind its charge (which was true ) that the overthrow of Ukraine¡¯s democratically elected President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014 was no authentic ¡®democratic revolution¡¯ such as the U.S. government and its ¡®news¡¯ media said, but was instead a very bloody U.S. coup d¡¯etat in Ukraine , which was organized from the U.S. Embassy there, starting by no later than 1 March 2013 , a year beforehand. Foer wrote: ¡°The Russians have made an art of publicizing the material they have filched to injure their adversaries. The locus classicus of this method was a recording of a blunt call between State Department official Toria [that¡¯s actually ¡®Victoria¡¯] Nuland [a close friend of both Hillary Clinton and Dick Cheney] and the American ambassador to Kiev, Geoffrey Pyatt. The Russians allegedly planted the recording on YouTube and then tweeted a link to it ¡ª and from there it became international news. Though they never claimed credit for the leak, few doubted the White House¡¯s contention that Russia was the source.¡± To a neoconservative, even defensive measures (such as Russia¡¯s there exposing the lies that America uses to ¡®justify¡¯ economic sanctions and other hostile acts against Russia) ¡ª indeed, anything that Russia does against America¡¯s aggressions against Russia, and against Russia¡¯s allies (such as Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, Bashar al-Assad, and Viktor Yanukovych) ¡ª anything that Russia does, is somehow evil and blameworthy. And, of course, America¡¯s aggressions are not. The U.S. government and its neocon propagandists are outraged that some people are trying to expose ¡ª instead of to spread ¡ª their lies. The American government isn¡¯t yet neocon enough, in the view of such liars. About the author =SUBSCRIBE TODAY!

Bias substituting for legitimate journalism is bad enough, disgracefully worse by featuring misinformation, distortions and lies about one candidate, while effusively praising the other undeservedly ¨C highlighting nonexistent virtues for Hillary, suppressing negatives disqualifying her for any public office. 
Why haven¡¯t other major media reported the news Fox News anchor Bret Baier broke Wednesday night about likely indictment(s) from the FBI¡¯s Clinton Foundation probe ¨C though not before it¡¯s completed weeks or months from now? The New York Times and Washington Post continue as lead Trump antagonists, one-sidedly promoting Hillary¡¯s candidacy, acting as virtual press agents. Times columnist Charles Blow calls him ¡°an existential threat¡± ¨C based solely on his rhetoric. As a businessman, he has no public record ¨C unlike clear evidence of Hillary¡¯s war crimes, racketeering and perjury. Lately, he¡¯s been staying on point in the campaign¡¯s late stages, diverging from his earlier bombast, apparently gaining support as November 8 approaches ¨C likely why intense bashing persists along with drowning out negatives about Hillary, especially multiple FBI probes of her email scandal and racketeering foundation. Focusing solely on Trump, Blow writes as follows: Donald Trump is a bigot. Donald Trump is a demagogue. Donald Trump is a sexist, misogynist, chauvinist pig. Donald Trump is a bully. Donald Trump is a cheat. Donald Trump is a pathological liar. Donald Trump is a nativist. Donald Trump¡¯s campaign (attracts) anti-Semites, Nazis and white nationalists¡­ Donald Trump (is a sexual molester), an unrepentant predator. ¡­Donald Trump is a lowlife degenerate¡­¡± Phew! 
Blow apparently believes Hillary is America¡¯s sweetheart, saying she¡¯s ¡°tolerant.¡± He¡¯s ¡°intoleran(t).¡± She¡¯s ¡°respect(ful).¡± He¡¯s ¡°disrespect(ful).¡± She¡¯s ¡°a politician with some flaws.¡± He¡¯s ¡°a flaw threatening our politics¡­America¡¯s existential threat.¡± No legitimate editor would touch Blow¡¯s rubbish. Times editors featured it. 
WaPo editors claim ¡°the only way Trump can win¡± is if voters forget or ignore what he¡¯s said. Despite lots of bombast earlier in the campaign, he¡¯s toned down his rhetoric, staying disciplined late in the campaign, and presented ideas on how he¡¯ll govern if elected, agree or disagree with him. 
No duopoly power aspirants for congressional seats and the nation¡¯s highest office represent popular interests ¨C no matter what they say. With rare exceptions proving the rule, they all represent dirty business as usual. Voters have to decide from a deplorable array of unpalatable choices, especially for president. 
Trump¡¯s main virtue is he¡¯s not Hillary. She threatens humanity with possible nuclear war. He¡¯d rather profit from planet earth than destroy it ¨C and his business enterprises along with it. What type leader do you prefer at the most perilous time in world history? A simple choice for anyone valuing life over possible mass annihilation.

A same day article discussed The Times¡¯ latest anti-Trump broadside. WaPo featured two editorials hammering him, following so many others earlier, disgracefully accusing him of everything imaginable, while practically elevating Hillary to sainthood by comparison. ¡°Will Republicans respect democracy,¡± WaPo editors asked? How can anyone knowledgeable about how America is run respect what¡¯s nonexistent, not earlier or now? ¡°The big question after Tuesday¡¯s election¡­will be whether the nation¡¯s leaders act to preserve our republic ¨C or hasten a descent toward a banana republic,¡± said WaPo editors. They failed to explain US governance resembles the way a crime family operates ¨C a godfather (or godmother) atop the hierarchy, serving privileged interests exclusively. .. The ¡°first priority (for the nation¡¯s leadership) must be preserving and restoring the country¡¯s democratic institutions¡­¡± WaPo editors claimed. How can it when none exist? America is a rogue state, run by its lunatic fringe, neocon extremists, waging endless wars of aggression, punishing ordinary people with neoliberal harshness, enforcing police state viciousness on resisters, a hair¡¯s breadth from instituting full-blown tyranny ¨C likely coming with Hillary in charge. .. WaPo editors are terrified about how multiple investigations of her wrongdoing might turn out ¨C heading toward possibly indicting and impeaching her, ludicrously claiming: .. ¡°There is no substantiated charge against Ms. Clinton that would warrant impeachment, or even talk of impeachment. Despite suggestions otherwise, there is also no imminent indictment against the Democratic nominee, or any available evidence suggesting that indictment is a realistic possibility¡­ Instead, what the nation has seen over the closing days of this campaign is a party preparing to (mis)use extraordinary congressional powers for despicable political ends.¡± 
Fact: Volumes of evidence show Hillary guilty of war crimes, orchestrating coups, other international and constitutional law violations, racketeering, perjury, obstruction of justice, fraud, influence-selling pay-for-play, and jeopardizing national security by using her private server for classified State Department documents ¨C enough to lock anyone up for life. 
Separately, WaPo editors said ¡°Trump¡¯s election would be a major threat to the economy¡± ¨C a way over-the-top unjustifiable claim, saying: .. His ¡°election would be a major new source of instability here and abroad¡­Suddenly, a man with a deep-seated hostility to, and incomprehension of, markets would be at the helm of the world¡¯s preeminent market economy.¡± A billionaire business tycoon with no comprehension of markets? No one could become super-rich without a keen understanding of how they work ¨C so what irks WaPo editors? .. They support jobs-killing trade deals like NAFTA and TPP. Trump¡¯s justifiable opposition riles them. They¡¯re angry because he¡¯s right accusing the (Wall-Street controlled) Fed of keeping interest rates near zero for political reasons, along with government agencies fudging economic data like GDP, monthly jobs numbers and inflation, among others ¨C to make economic conditions look rosier than reality. .. Trump ¡°failed to level with the public about the challenges before us, to provide a plausible sense of how he would improve things ¨C or to demonstrate much of anything except the risks of entrusting him with management of an $18 trillion economy,¡± WaPo editors claimed. Agree or disagree with him, he presented a clearer agenda than Hillary ¨C time and again proving she¡¯s a serial liar, dishonest, untrustworthy, ruthless and dangerous.

This use of racism to divide the working class and whip up support for the business classes is as old as American capitalism.
Trump has whipped up sentiment against Latinos and immigrants (a minority of Americans of Latino ancestry is first-generation immigrants) by loudly proclaiming that they are guilty of all kinds of crimes. In fact, violent has fallen 48% in the US since the early 1990s, yet in the past 25 years immigration has soared. Research shows that immigrants commit less crime than the native-born. It isn¡¯t hard to figure out why. First, those who don¡¯t yet have citizenship are afraid of being deported, so they keep their noses clean. But more importantly, and contrary to what Trump alleges, immigrants are go-getters who have taken the big step of leaving home to accomplish something. They are highly motivated to succeed and often bring with them a great deal of human capital. As for jobs, immigrants aren¡¯t stealing them from the native born. They are doing different jobs than locals with the same educational attainments. That¡¯s because they often don¡¯t have as good English skills or can¡¯t afford to turn down menial jobs. The hatred against immigrants Trump has fostered is based on a set of lies, lies that are easily shown to be falsehoods. But it is a little unlikely that this hatred of foreigners will subside Wednesday , whatever happens. 
Trump has given aid and comfort to the American far right. With his racist dog whistles (and often just unadorned racism) he has emboldened the Ku Klux Klan, Alt-right and other disgusting organizations. David Duke of Louisiana has been encouraged to run for the senate and is pledging to be Trump¡¯s biggest supporter. This genie will be hard to put back into its lamp. 
Trump has encouraged hatred for Muslims in the US on an unprecedented scale. Hatred for Muslims has already been adopted as a latent platform by the Republican Party, but they are usually at least a little more subtle about it. If Trump can succeed in discriminating against Muslim-Americans, he can then proceed to discriminate against the rest of us on one pretext or another. Muslim-Americans are only 1% of our population. There isn¡¯t actually any danger of them taking over the country or imposing their religious law, and most terrorism comes from the far right or from overseas, not from native-born Muslim-Americans. Trump supporters have already burned down a mosque in Florida, have assaulted Muslims (and Sikhs, whose men wear turbans) all over the country, and some Trumpists have plotted terrorism against Muslims. 
Trump has left a legacy of contempt for women and a resurgent patriarchy. He has juvenilized women and hurled slurs at them. He accused Megyn Kelly of being on her period when she asked him sharp questions. He boasted about grabbing strangers by the genitals. His message is that women should be judged not by their intelligence, hard work, or character but by their breast size and figure and the symmetry of their faces. 
Trump has taken optimistic trend lines and pulled them down into Sheol with him. He has diminished our country, traumatized our children, and made us laughingstocks in the urbane capitals of the world. He leaves us a large bequest, tied up with a bow, of hatred and prejudice, smelling like the piece of dog shit that is Donald Trump

The satire about a real estate tycoon and reality TV star turned presidential candidate could be perceived as a hatchet job. However, it offers an entertaining topical comedy on the surface, with glimpses into the climate of fear and xenophobia that has spread across America.
The improbable, uncontrollable Republican candidate here, Kurt Seaman (a name that results in sophomoric jokes that take away from the effort), bears an obvious resemblance to Trump. The mogul ¡°wants to add the White House to his list of properties,¡± as one character notes. The Trumpisms include the well- respected daughter (called Srilanka here), ex-wives with names that evoke Trump¡¯s, negative attitudes toward immigrants and even an uncomfortable feeling in his party that he will hurt them on Election Day.
¡°Vicu?a¡± clearly evolved with the election since the Jon Robin Baitz play (his fourth world premiere for the Center Theatre Group) was drafted earlier this year. It takes place as preparations are under way for the third debate between Seaman (played by Harry Groener) and his unseen female opponent, who clearly did better in the first two debates.
Directed by Robert Egan, most of the play¡¯s action takes place in a posh tailor¡¯s atelier, where the character Anselm Kassar (played by Brian George), an Iranian Jewish immigrant, designs garments for presidents and world leaders that create the illusion of power and confidence. The character is based on an actual Washington, D.C., tailor named Georges de Paris, a Greek immigrant who crafted suits for presidents for decades.
Seaman decides that for his last debate he needs a magical, powerful suit made out of the finest vicu?a (hence the name) for him by the great presidential tailor. ¡°Clothing conveys credibility,¡± is the premise. He believes the polls are lying: ¡°People are afraid to admit they are on my side.¡± However, just in case, this emperor wants new clothes.
The tailor decides, ignoring his personal feelings, to make a suit for a candidate that he finds repellent and make him more. He cannot resist the reflected glory of his powerful suits on the wannabe or truly powerful.
Seaman is at first delighted to meet the tailor¡¯s apprentice, Amir Masoud (played by Ramiz Monsef), who is the son of immigrants. He tells him ¡°Apprenticeship is good. It¡¯s my thing.¡± But the candidate¡¯s world view collides profoundly with this young Muslim man¡¯s concepts of justice and America. The candidate actually comments that if people cannot make it in their own country and flee, ¡°what kind of people are we letting in?¡±
Amir serves as the play¡¯s conscience and challenges the candidate (and his daughter). He points out, ¡°A suit can¡¯t stand in for actual goodness and vision.¡± Amir¡¯s character (like others in the play) is uneven and his actions do not always convey his feelings (like taking advantage of his prep school and Harvard University scholarships before flaunting his Marxist leanings.)
Srilanka (played by Samantha Sloyan) is tired defending her dad against his inappropriate comments. Initially, she tells Amir, ¡°His message is lost when he is not ¡®disciplined.¡¯¡± The dutiful daughter even boasts that ¡°when he¡¯s elected he will be far more human than he¡¯s being painted.¡± However, once he speaks positively about woman at her alma mater and then does a disparaging sexist interview, she can no longer ignore his inappropriate comments.
The Republican party leadership cannot ignore his ¡°pitchfork campaign¡± and questionable opinions either. They offer Seaman billions to throw the debate and not become president. The real estate tycoon is now engaged in negotiations ¡°to buy and sell the presidency.¡±
The final scene is the debate, with the candidate and his exquisite vicu?a suit. The final act of the real election is yet to be played. But this play¡¯s final act is veers into darker territory and an ¡°emperor has no clothes¡± type moment.
The Vicu?a cast is excellent. Groener avoids the obvious parody, but conveys the appropriate pomposity. Sloyan does a great job displaying early confidence crumbling to vulnerability of Srilanka¡¯s campaign life. However, the key character is Monsef¡¯s Amir, and the actor is up to the task of carrying the audience on his journey challenging the candidate¡¯s beliefs and actions.
¡°Vicu?a¡± portrays Trump in an ¡°Emperor¡¯s New Clothes¡± type tale, opening one week before the election. Baitz¡¯ new play may not have a long shelf life now. However, it raises some serious issues that are not going away on Nov. 9. Maybe the play will be dusted off years from now and presented as a dramedy based on actual people. But, in the meantime, the reality is a little too real as election day looms.

Who should the people cast their vote for on November 8? 2016 has brought a variety of topics to the surface for both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. However, Americans seem to miss a lot of information from both parties during the debates and rallies. Each person is preoccupied with defending themselves or offending the other. Believe it or not, during all the drama there are clear proposals from both Clinton and Trump on several concerns.
A Few Prominent Proposals: Education: When it comes to higher education, Clinton and Trump cannot be more opposites. Clinton introduced the New College Compact. This would allow students entering a four-year college, within their state, not have to borrow money for tuition, books, and fees.
Trump has opposed the New College Compact and claims he would fight any proposal for debt-free public higher education.
Taxes: However, both do see eye to eye on many tax related problems. Clinton and Trump promised the working middle-class Americans a massive tax reduction. Also, they both ensure that the wealthy will pay their fair share in taxes.
Gun Control: Another area that Clinton and Trump agree upon is gun control. This may come as a surprise for many, yet the similarities cannot be ignored. They both want to keep guns out of the hands of violent criminals and the severely mentally ill. They also want to expand background checks. Trump goes as far as suggesting ¡°that we empower all law-abiding gun owners to defend themselves because the police cannot be everywhere all the time.¡± With either candidate, all gun owners rightfully able to bear arms will be entitled to do so, no-one is threatening to disarm anyone.
Immigration: This is one of the most talked about topics among the presidential nominees. Within the first 100 days of office, Clinton says she will set forth a plan that will treat people with respect, fix the family visa backlog, end the three and ten-year bars, and protect American borders.
Trump claims he will have Mexico pay for a wall on the Southern borders and end the catch and release process. Trump also explained that he will deport illegal immigrants, who have committed a crime, in one day.
By going to each of the candidate¡¯s website, people can see a complete copy of their goals, as president of the United States. Determining which nominee would be a better fit as the commander in chief, is an opinion based on how much or how little voters relate to each candidate¡¯s ideas.
Unfortunately, getting acquainted with Clinton and Trump¡¯s prospective plans is not an easy task. There has been chaos from the very beginning with these campaigns. There has never been a dull moment, that is for sure. However, now is the time to become serious and to remember that the world is watching.

Trump was elected as the 45th President of the United States. In the early hours of November 9, 2016, Hillary Clinton conceded the election.
Both candidates helped usher in a new political era; she is the first woman to get this far in a presidential election successfully. Whereas, Trump is the first person to be elected to the highest office in the U.S. who never served in the military and never served in a political capacity.
When the night culminated with Trump winning well over the required 270 electoral votes, the election was called. The reality star now holds a new title, President Elect Donald J. Trump.
His presidency will begin with Republicans holding the majority in both chambers of Congress. President-Elect Trump will be nominating a new Supreme Court Justice to fill the seat vacated when Antonin Scalia died in February.
Surprising Night at the Polls On November 8, the polls began to close at 6:00 p.m. ET on the east coast. Whereas on the west coast, the polls closed 11:00 p.m. There were early projections, which made hearts race. The numbers bounced back and forth in many key swing states. That is until eastern state¡¯s tallies began to roll in, then the numbers evened out.
Polling Site Glitches Many polling sites experienced technical issues. Trump attempted early in the day to sue Nevada because the polls in Clark County remained open for an hour and a half on Nov. 7. The judge stated there was no fraud since the state¡¯s law indicates if a person is in line before the polling site closes, they must be allowed to cast their ballot.
In Durham County, N.C., there was a delay beginning the votes, so the Democratic Party sought to have the time extended to make up for time lost. This was granted, and the polls remained open for 30 of the 45 minutes requested.
Donald Trump Needs to Reunite the Country Commentators on CNN Politics agree that the campaign tore through the fabric that makes America great. During the campaigning, citizens became polarized into two drastically divisive and hateful camps.
How is President Elect Trump going to heal the wounds he inflicted on Clinton¡¯s supporters, the Muslim community, Latino citizens, and every other group?
During Trump¡¯s campaign, he threatened to have Clinton arrested when he won, build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, close the mosques, and restart stop and search policies. He said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, and lower the tax ceiling for the richest Americans.
His supporters are thrilled, and Clinton¡¯s voters are stunned. There are fear and confusion in the air.
Hillary Clinton Concedes Clinton sent out her campaign manager to tell her supporters that it was late and the final tallies were not going to happen soon. She asked them to go home and get some rest. The announcement was made that Clinton would speak in the morning.
Within an hour, Trump told his supporters that she had called him and conceded. The President-Elect proffered a simple acceptance. He stated that his was not a campaign but a movement for change.

This recent waffling could be an indicator that he will not deliver on his campaign promises.
The day after he won the election, he was given his first test by his own party. According to top aides for Trump, there is a compromise that would include more federal border patrol officers, and extend the border fence. The idea is to extend parts of the border with a double layered fence. An official from the Department of Homeland Security and a Republican from the House of Representatives said Trump¡¯s wall is improbable; it would have to be built through rivers and lakes, rough terrain and private property. It would also block the view of border agents. This wall would make it difficult to watch the border. According to the House Aid, the meeting will take place as soon as his transition team is set. The spokesperson would not offer any comment on the meeting or compromise plan from the lawmakers. Mexico again said the day after the election they would not pay for his wall. The wall has never been mentioned officially, but if Congress takes a stand against Trump it will be an extension of the fence once proposed by Secretary Clinton.
According to the House aide, the meeting will take place as soon as the transition team is set. The spokesperson would not comment on the meeting or the compromise from lawmakers. Mexico again stated, the day after the election, they will not pay for his wall. This boundary has not been mentioned officially, but if Congress takes a stand against Trump it will be an extension of the fence, once proposed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Another key focus of the presidential campaign was immigration. It was stated that illegal immigrants are stealing American jobs and pose a security risk to the nation. Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Michael McCaul called the idea of the wall, an emotional unthinking reaction to a highly sensitive issue, or a ¡°knee-jerk reaction.¡± Another indication that the president-elect will not deliver on his campaign promises.
The day after the election Marie Keating, a first-grade teacher in California, asked her 10 students what they wanted to ask new President-elect Trump. One student said she did not want her family to be sent back to Mexico. This statement prompted Keating to have her class write letters telling Trump what was on their mind. Little Nicole asked him to be kind and to always tell the truth, and not to incite violence between people of color. Another little girl asked him to allow people of different races to be friends. A little boy asked him not to say that people who do not have white skin are all robbers. Another little girl said simply that she hoped he did not start a war, and another asked that he not send them back to Mexico. Keating posted the letters on Facebook for everyone to see. She was proud of her students because they asked for things that were necessary for them, in a respectful way.
Anthony Scaramucci, the creator of hedge-fund Skybridge Capital and one of Trump¡¯s top advisors, says Americans should take President-elect Trump at his word. He believes he will build a wall ¨C if he says he will. When New York Magazine asked him how it would be possible to have Mexico pay for the wall, he responded, that the U.S. could charge an excise tax on goods coming into the country from Mexico. However, he also said the American people did the right thing by electing Trump. The interviewer corrected him, stating that American¡¯s voted for Clinton, not Trump. Scaramucci replied he did not see that way.
If President-elect Trump wants to build a wall, he will have to convince Congress using a cost-efficient plan. The Affordable Care Act has provided millions of people with health insurance, at an affordable premium. The average cost of health insurance within the marketplace, after the 110 percent rise, will be $78 a month. The newly elected president-elect has changed his mind on repealing the health coverage. He states that he is willing to keep the Affordable Care Act and instead, make the needed changes. Therefore, it is entirely possible, Trump will not deliver on some of his campaign promises.

The legalization of marijuana, in some form, was a ballot initiative in nine states, on Nov. 8, 2016. Five of the nine states voted for recreational use and the other four were focused on medicinal purposes. 
California, Nevada, Maine, and Massachusetts passed the recreational use of cannabis. These states join the ranks with Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and D.C. Arizona still offers legal medical marijuana but recreational use was voted down by 51.9 percent. 
Florida, North Dakota, Montana, and Arkansas voted to join the 24 other states that have legalized the use of the plant. New Recreational Marijuana States and Laws: Massachusetts: Recreational use, sale, possession, and cultivation of cannabis have been legalized. The law faced opposition from both sides of the isle. Republican Governor Charlie Baker and Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh joined Attorney General Maura Healey, in March, for a Boston Globe op-ed. The state had decriminalized the use of weed for recreational use. It was also legalized for medicinal use, in 2012. Healey, Baker, and Walsh met to discuss this matter and agreed that the plant should not be easily accessible or sold commercially. The voters in Massachusetts were divided. The recreational use of marijuana was supported by 54 percent. The new law will go into effect December 15. Cannabis sales will follow the same requirements as alcohol. California: Proposition 64 was viewed as the most important among the legalization issues on the ballot. Fifty-six percent of the voters agreed with the initiative, for people 21 and over. This not only completes recreational use of the plant on the West Coast, it benefits the state with the sixth-largest world economy. Cannabis legalization passed despite opposition from Senator Dianne Feinstein and Governor Jerry Brown. In 2014, Brown said: 
How many people can get stoned and still have a great state or a great nation? 
The win of Proposition 64, does not simply allow for the commercial sale of marijuana, it rolled back the period of incarceration for thousands of people convicted on marijuana-related charges. The proposition went into effect at 12:01 a.m., on November 9. Residents can grow as many as six plants in their homes. However, it will not be available is stores until Jan. 1, 2018. Driving under the influence of and smoking marijuana in public will remain illegal. Those who break this law will be charged a $100 fine. Nevada: Recreational use, cultivation, possession, and commercial sales of the plant passed with 54 percent. The law pertains to adults, 21 and over. Most of the state is conservative, and until residents helped elect Obama, in 2008 and 2012, it was considered a Red state. However, the legalization of cannabis was opposed by Democratic Senator Harry Reid and Republican Governor Brian Sandoval. Regardless, on Jan. 1, 2018, medical marijuana dispensaries will be able to apply for a license that will allow them to sell the plant products to anyone, 21 or older. Only the dispensaries will be eligible to sell cannabis. Maine: It is legal for adults, 21 and over, to use cannabis for recreational use. People can cultivate, possess, and purchase marijuana. The legislation barely passed with 50.3 percent. The state will add a 10 percent sales tax on recreational cannabis. The new law will allow for retail stores and social clubs, as long as they are licensed and permitted in the municipalities where they grow. 
Many states, including D.C., have opted to decriminalize recreational use of marijuana to save money. During an interview, in March, President Obama told Vice News that incarcerating people for marijuana-related charges is expensive. It was his hope, that if enough states decriminalized possession and use, Congress would reschedule the drug. 
Legalization creates a new economy around the sales of marijuana and cannabis-infused lotions, oils, edibles, and related paraphernalia. Tax revenues have significantly increased in the states that have legalized recreational use of the plant. 
Tax revenue from marijuana sales in Colorado was $70 million in the last fiscal year. This was twice the amount collected from alcohol sales over the same period. In 2013, cannabis sales were at $1.5 billion. The revenue grew to $2.7 billion, in 2015. Cannabis investment and research firm ArcView Group believes that if all 50 states and D.C. were to completely legalize the plant, it is possible the U.S. will gain $35 billion in revenue, by 2020. What Will Trump Do? 
Despite the economic boost the legalization of marijuana can bring to the U.S., there is a doubt that President-elect Donald Trump will be supportive. Leslie Bocskor, the president and founder of Electrum Partners, called the future leader of the U.S., ¡°a boogie man of unparalleled size and fearsomeness to the legal cannabis industry.¡± His election could prevent the recall of the Controlled Substances Act, that Obama and many Americans wanted. 
The marijuana wins gained in the 2016 election means that now, 60 million Americans will not be arrested, lose student loans, or their children for using the plant at the state level. It is still against federal law to use or possess cannabis. 
Executive Director of the Drug Policy Alliance Ethan Nadelmann said that he cannot predict what Trump will do concerning marijuana or the Controlled Substances Act. In 1990, Trump was for the legalization of all drugs, regardless, he leaned heavily on the Republican drug-war rhetoric in political debates. 
Nevertheless, Trump told the International Association of Chiefs of Police that marijuana was an issue for individual states to handle. He agreed that Congress should re-write certain laws to be compatible with the state laws. Lobbyists believe that any impact on the use of cannabis will depend on who Trump chooses for members of his Cabinet. 
At one time, it was possible that Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor, would hold the position of U.S. Attorney General. He delayed the limited legalization of medical marijuana, as the governor of New Jersey. Throughout his own run as a Republican candidate for president, Christie spoke of enforcing federal law against cannabis. However, his involvement in the Bridgegate scandal could force Trump to look, instead, at the former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani for U.S. Attorney General. 
Giuliani was also a federal prosecutor. When he was mayor, more people were arrested (per capita), in New York City, for marijuana-related charges, than any other American city. This makes him another unwanted choice for those who use the plant, in any form, for any reason. Hope for Cannabis in America 
There is no need for weed-lovers to lose heart, reminds Professor Marsha Cohen, from UC Hastings College of the Law, in San Francisco. She stated that the Department of Justice cannot change things overnight; it would take time, organization, and money for Trump to crackdown on marijuana use nationwide. However, it may not matter who becomes the next attorney general. 
Congress, led by Paul Ryan, has consistently denied funding for the Justice Department to impede on states that legalize cannabis. Despite the desires of the new attorney general, it is likely Congress will continue to prevent federal meddling at the state-level. 
Cohen pointed out that Florida voted in favor of the new medical marijuana law and Trump with the same ballot. Therefore, it is uncertain what he will do, as president, concerning the use of the plant. Cohen stated that cannabis is a political issue and will remain such; it is possible that weed has become too popular to undo.

The question Americans have is ¡°What outcome will these similarities have in the United States, under his leadership?¡±
Hitler believed Germany should be a world leader and this could happen, if only Aryans and Germans were allowed to live in the country. Under the guise of ¡°Americans First,¡± Trump wants to build a Great Wall that will keep out illegal immigrants and deport all illegal aliens. He has stated he would only allow those who embrace the American way-of-life into the country. He intends to have his boundary funded by Mexico.
Hitler stated that those who were not German should not be allowed to speak on matters of the country. He believed Communism was a threat to his nation and should be abolished. He also stated democracy and rights for workers would upset civilization. Trump has said, on his first day in office, he will ban White House officials from lobbying for foreign governments and prevent foreign representatives of special interest groups from raising money for U.S. elections. Again, wanting outsiders to remain on the outskirts of the nation but to what outcome?
The German dictator fought in the German army during World War I, before returning to Munich, as a corporal. The loss of WWI and the signing of the Treaty of Versailles angered Hitler. The corporal believed Germany was powerful and lost the war because the country was betrayed. He blamed the Jewish people and the communists.
The Treaty of Versailles: Re-determined German boundaries ¨C Eupean-Malm[eacute]dy went to Belgium, Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France, eastern districts went to Poland, Memel was given to Lithuania, and the majority of Schleswig went to Denmark Colonies that belonged to the country were all taken away Required Germany to make financial amends for damages caused by WWI The country¡¯s military was severely reduced and disarmed from specific classes of weapons Germany accepted their responsibility and that of their allies for the damages Created the Covenant of the New League of Nations in 1919, which Germany was prevented from joining until 1926 A demilitarized zone was established The Saar was banned from Germany for 15 years The German government signed the Treaty of Versailles under protest. Many politicians were assassinated for their part in the agreement.
Trump blames immigrants for the loss of American jobs and the Democrats for the state of the country. He wants to dismantle radical Isl¨¡mic terrorist groups and to stop paying ransoms to ISIS for the release of Americans. He also intends to put an end to the Iran nuclear deal. The Iran Deal deferred the Middle Eastern country from building a weapon of mass destruction by 9 months.
Hitler¡¯s views fell in-line with those of the National Socialist German Workers¡¯ Party, which later became the Nazi Party. He joined the small group in 1920. He was a charismatic speaker and thus, gained support as a leader from right-wing extremists.
Trump speaks plainly on topics concerning the U.S. He does not believe political correctness and this approach has gained him a significant following. There are Americans looking for a leader they can relate to on a cognitive level. The working-class believe Trump will lead the country out of a poor economic state.
The German economy worsened and the country feared communism. The people wanted a strong leader with a solution. Hitler¡¯s goal was to return a strong order of tradition to Germany. After WWI, citizens were impoverished and lived for themselves, as if ¡°they had nothing to lose.¡± Citizens were without a leader once Commander-in-Chief Kaiser Wilhelm was forced out of the country.
Germany was left in political and economic chaos, without leadership, and an enormous national debt to pay. While political groups fought over changing the government to a democracy or communism, the people were without food. Lack of resources caused rioting in the streets.
Hitler gained power through his engaging speeches. He gave the country a leader and he blamed the Jews for the economic situation in Germany. Hitler also spoke of extreme nationalism.
Trump wants to ¡°Make America Great Again.¡± The economy, as he purposes, is the best way to start this process. He wants to put ¡°Americans First¡± concerning job creation and industry. He stated that China will cease in stealing intellectual property from the U.S. During a speech in Pennsylvania, Trump stated, ¡°I am going to instruct my Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator, which should have been done years ago.¡±
He is reaching out to a country that is tired of politicians and has a strong desire for a different kind of leadership. Citizens are hungry for change and Trump supporters believe he is the farthest option from a politician. Hitler was also not regarded as a politician. He slid into office when Germany was hungry and lost with no one to lead them and enforced his policies and extreme ideas. Under President-elect Trump, will Americans suffer similar outcomes under his leadership?
The Republican candidate insists that ¡°the TPP [Trans-Pacific Partnership] creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people can¡¯t veto.¡± He believes he can negotiate better trade deals, one-on-one, than with a round-table-discussion of countries.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership: Created to level the playing field for American workers and businesses More Made-in-America exports More higher-paying jobs Cuts over 18,000 taxes other countries put on Made-in-America products Ensures American ranchers, farmers, service suppliers, and small businesses can compete Will expand Made-in-America exports and support jobs through trade remedy laws, safeguards, countervailing duties, and anti-dumping laws Ensure American exporters are allowed procedural due process and the rules used by all countries part of Trans-Pacific Partnership are transparent Trump wants to renegotiate trade agreements to make it is easier to invest, hire, build, produce, and manufacture in the U.S. He believes this will make America the best country to conduct business. Trump intends to carry out this goal without allowing immigrants into the country.
There will not be any more jobs lost to Mexico, immigrants, or globalism. Jobs and wealth will stay in the U.S. ¨C extreme nationalism. His ¡°Make America Great Again¡± and ¡°Americans First¡± slogans, along with his off-the-cuff, violence-inciting speeches, have won him the title, president-elect. This is also in-line with Hitler¡¯s idea that Germany could rule the world, but only as a single race.
These similarities could lead to a frightening outcome in America. Neither Hitler nor Trump had many policies, nevertheless, they offered an alternative type of leadership in struggling countries. Will the outcome, under President-elect Trump be similar to the experience suffered by Germany under Hitler¡¯s leadership?

The Kremlin said that the political figures vowed to work together to improve U.S.-Russian relations and try to create world peace.
The statement issued by the Kremlin also stated that Trump and Putin discussed settling the crisis in Syria, and combating terrorism. They also agreed that their aides will work together to schedule a direct meeting.
Trump¡¯s office declared in a statement that the Russian leader offered his congratulations before they discussed a range of issues. The numerous items included challenges and threats facing the U.S. and Russia. Strategic economic matters and the U.S.-Russia relationship that began over 200 years ago were also discussed.
After Trump¡¯s triumph last week, the president-elect has received congratulatory calls from an enormous amount of foreign leaders. Putin sent the president-elect a statement concerning his desire to have a discussion based on a clear respect for each other¡¯s political viewpoints.
Trump applauded Putin as an as a robust leader during his campaign. He also said that the two world leaders should collaborate to combat terrorists. The president-elect chiefly mentioned the Islamic State in Syria. He stated that closer relations with Russia would try to create world peace.
The Washington Post reported that the president-elect seemed to dismiss Russia¡¯s responsibility for their annexation of Crimea and their intervention in the Ukraine. The future leader of the U.S. also questioned the relevance of NATO.
Trump and Putin agreed to share a common view in an attempt to ease tension between the U.S. and Russia. They want to unite their efforts against the common enemy and then fight international terrorism and extremism. The Kremlin declared that the two discussed ways to settle the Syrian crisis and create world peace.
The Kremlin added that they talked about ways to build commerce and induce constructive cooperation between the two nations. Next year, the U.S. and Russia will celebrate the 210-year-anniversary of the start of diplomatic relations. Russian officials stated that the date might encourage the progress of a relationship that would satisfy the interest of both countries.
Putin¡¯s government said that Trump is looking forward to having a long-term and resilient relationship with Russia and the nation¡¯s people. Putin stated that he is ready to have a discussion with Washington that it will be based on mutual respect. There will also be no intervention into each other¡¯s affairs.
There will be no intervention into each other¡¯s affairs. The Russian government believes that creating a solid root for bilateral ties is important. This was especially stressed by the rising trade-economic component.
The Kremlin stated that the two nations should return to a state of equally valuable cooperation. Putin said they will attempt to address the concern and try to ease the tension between the two nations and create world peace.

He sprays white-knuckle antipathy upon all manner of people of varied religions, ethnicities, race, and any other target of choice. He avoids the ¡°politically correct¡± avenue and simply does things his own way. Trump¡¯s age of distractions has thrown the country into a frenzy leaving people careening and disoriented. The real issue is the lack of focus is not limited to the realm of politics; it has shifted into other areas that have affected many on a personal level. This is not really about the distraction of politics, it is more centered on the politics of distraction.
One of the things that continues to rise over the past 15 years or so is the increase in diagnosis involving focus. Whether it is ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) or OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), the list of diagnosis that indicates a challenge in our ability to focus has America in the lead above any other country. The blame has shifted from the school system to the household, to the programmers of major television stations and now, Trump¡¯s age of distractions. Famed novelist Arthur Golden said, ¡°A mind troubled by doubts cannot focus on the course of victory.¡± With this in mind, it is evident that no matter who is to blame for the lack of focus, victims need to discover a remedy fast.
Focus, by definition, is the adjustment for distinct vision; a center of activity, attraction, and attention. It is the last part of the definition that really stands out, ¡°the center of a person¡¯s activity, attraction, and attention . ¡± Here is the real deal, people do not possess focus if it has not arrested those three areas of life. That is the difference between hobbies and passions. The latter captivates all you are and all you do. Many have failed simply because they have refused to bring their lives into a definite focus.
Focus allows us to harness our skills, intelligence, and resources and put them to work on our life goals. Most, at one time or another, have fallen into the trap of being a ¡°Jack of All Trades.¡± The part that is often missed is that we become masters of none. We spread ourselves thin in an effort to appear busy, but life¡¯s successes come from a laser beam approach toward tasks. This may be the reason America ranks nearly last amidst other countries with regards to productivity. We have more stuff than ever, but we seem to be doing less. The issue lies in our inability to focus.

Where do we begin? In a society that is screaming at us from sun up to sun down, how will we find the time to focus? Even on our jobs, we get assigned to one project only to be told the other five are really the priority. Everything was due two days ago. People consume fast food at alarming rates because it is supposed to be fast and no one has time to cook a balanced meal. This, however, leads to fears of illnesses like cancer and diabetes. People of all nationalities seem to be in a losing battle with the clock and now experts are telling saying the biggest problem is really the lack of focus. Listed below are solutions that can ease the pressure and help people to find focus in Trump¡¯s age of distractions:
Admit other things are important too: One of the first mistakes we make is trying to go ¡°cold turkey¡± when it comes to our distractions. You have had them long enough for them to become a new normal. Therefore, cutting them out will not be easy. First, devise a plan to lower a number of distractions by setting guidelines. By checking emails less frequently and turning the ringer off on your phone, you increase your ability to focus instantly. Solicit the help of colleagues: People tend to interrupt you because that is what you have trained them to do. Setting boundaries around yourself sends an instant message to people indicating you are in work mode. Let them know your times of ¡°on purpose¡± focus and that you are not to be disturbed. Usually, people will honor it. Utilize technology, sticky notes, and lists to your advantage: In your lap right now is the power to retake your focus. You probably have a smartphone, Tablet, Kindle or some other device capable of helping you organize your time. I find if we do not have a plan, we are planning to fail. Set reminders to study in your phone, read your morning paper on your iPad while commuting, or set a to-do list the night before. All these small tasks add up to big time savers in the future. In Trump¡¯s age of distraction, it has become easy to blame the lack of focus on external events. In reality, the only thing we really do control is our behavior in any given situation. Take back your life and readjust your focal point. You will be amazed at how closely life imitates a camera. Until it is turned on and focused, no memories are ever clearly captured. Remember, this is really not about the distraction of politics, but the responsibility of managing the politics of distraction.

c22606775f95774ebe7b3f6c792b6a1d96591ed6,0,carmody.j,2016-11-24T00:04:00.000+02:00,Hustle at Hofstra With Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,"On a chilly and rainy night, American living rooms became filled with a presidential debate that would go down in history as one of the most anticipated in modern times. and for all the wrong reasons. Every televised debate seemed to be more about optics than substance, more about this guy than that guy.
Presidential Debates: 
Some may remember the Kennedy-Nixon debate and the aftermath over Nixon¡¯s sweating on screen. There was the Bush-Dukakis optic of a towering George H.W. Bush over the diminutive Michael Dukakis. And few can forget the Benson-Quayle vice presidential debate and the, ¡°You¡¯re no John Kennedy¡± line.
For some reason, the build-up to the Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton debate was different. Would Trump go off the rails and say some absolutely ridiculous claim that would doom his chances? Would Clinton¡¯s health be an issue under the strain of the moment? And what of the moderator? Would Lester Holt come off a Clinton shill, as many had accused the mainstream media of being? Yes, this was a weird countdown to the Hustle at Hofstra.
Debate Results: In the end, this was more of a journeyman heavyweight than Ali-Frazier. Trump was the interrupting, aggrandizing, self-congratulatory man Americans have come to know ¨C all style and no substance. Like Trump, Clinton did not break any new ground. She was still looking to win this election on the votes of women and minorities. Trump, still hoping to gather enough people, angry with the status quo, to sneak into the White House. Many saw nothing in the debate to swing them one way or the other.
The debate showed people more than what candidate they should choose to elect, but it showed citizens a reflection of themselves, the American people. It showed citizens that they have collectively failed as a nation. Failed to preserve the republic, and failed to demand a system that would encourage the best administrators to run this country. Instead, Americans were saddled with two combatants that will result in a divisive president, no matter who wins. As the debate progressed, both participants hit on many good points that were missed due to their personalities.
There were two points brought up, one by each. Clinton questioned why Trump would not release his tax returns. That is a problem. What is he hiding? The second point was made when Trump asked why her IT people would not testify before Congress about the email and servers. A legitimate question, considering her ties to the Clinton Foundation, as secretary of state.
So in the end, the debate was not a dud but a lesson; a lesson to all Americans that the people have failed. Failed to control the corporations who poison the republic with wads of cash; failed to demand changes to the nominating process, so that citizens can choose among the best-of-the-best to run this country; and failed to pay attention, as the nation was co-opted from the people by crony capitalism.
Yes, Americans have failed; they have failed the men and women in the mirror. It is time to remember John F. Kennedy¡¯s words, ¡°Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.¡± For God sake, pay attention to the country.

Millions of people feel entirely disenfranchised by a political system that delivered the least favorable and trusted candidates in U.S. history. Many hoped that the Bernie Sanders campaign would represent a new direction and opportunity to take on entrenched power and extreme inequality, for a higher minimum wage, to defend Social Security, rebuild the labor movement, provide universal health care and free tuition. That campaign was largely suppressed, but its end does not change the desires and aspirations of tens of millions of people, workers and youth in particular, who are demanding real change.

By: Renee Nal | New Zeal Screenshot from ABC News Report (red commentary added) 
One of the many lies stemming from the mainstream media in the wake of Donald Trump¡¯s election is that hate crimes have increased. The source of this ridiculous whopper is the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), whose embarrassingly biased reports from partisan hacks are reflective of the mainstream ¡°news¡± outlets that cite the group as a legitimate source. 
Any reasonable journalist can take the most cursory of glances at the silly report to see at best, that it is not a valid source. The ¡°hateful intimidation and harassment¡± cited by the SPLC are, of course, not listed and therefore cannot be subject to scrutiny. This information, according to SPLC , was ¡°collected through news reports, social media, and direct submissions via SPLC¡¯s #ReportHate page¡± and is ¡°largely anecdotal.¡± 
The phrase ¡°largely anecdotal¡± should be a clue for mainstream media sources reporting about the so-called spike in hate crimes. 
Watch this report, which is based on the fake report from the SPLC: 
The New York Times , who recently pledged to be more honest or something, reported that ¡°attacks against American Muslims surged last year¡± citing the FBI (which leads to a broken link at the time of this writing) and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which immediately makes their entire article suspect: 
¡°Since the election, hate crime monitors like the Southern Poverty Law Center have reported a rash of verbal or physical abuse targeting minorities and others at schools, mosques and elsewhere.¡± 
There is no evidence. There is no due process. There are no convictions. Yet the mainstream media has been parroting the lie that hate crimes have increased since Donald Trump¡¯s election. 
Mainstream journalists have resources. They have money, they have numerous researchers and they have a massive platform. Yet, these same organizations do not bother to use their vast resources to inform Americans of the truth about the SPLC¡¯s fake report. This is why they have lost the trust of the American people. 
Last year, the SPLC had an ¡° operating budget ¡± of over $35 million dollars. They have an endowment fund of over $300 million dollars.

Communists from the ¡° Red Guards Austin ¡± were arrested after violently attacking Trump supporters during an anti-Trump rally at the Capitol on Sunday night, as reported at a local CBS affiliate . 
Trevor Loudon is well aware of the violent and ¡°secretive¡± Red Guards Austin, who he describes as ¡°extreme Maoist.¡± This communist group, Loudon explains, is ¡°aligned with the Red Guards Los Angeles and the Kansas City Missouri-based Progressive Youth Organization , both of which were heavily involved in anti-Trump protests before the election.¡± 
Referring to the arrests, the Red Guards Austin posted the following on Facebook using the code name ¡°Puka¡± for one of those arrested: 
A brief perusal of Red Guards Austin Facebook page reveals that this anti-capitalist group is not interested in peace. Advertising an anti-Trump rally last Thursday, they wrote : 
¡°Calling all militants. F¡ª the police. Show up if your pissed at this system and lets shut s¡ª down.¡± 
The communist group shared an event for students from the ¡° Revolutionary Student Front ¡± (which describes itself as a ¡°revolutionary anti-capitalist student movement¡± ) scheduled for this Friday night called ¡°¡®Not My President¡¯ to ¡®No More Presidents!'¡± which seeks to build ¡°a movement that can create a revolution to end capitalism will burn the oppressive roots from which fascism grows:¡± 
¡°With Donald Trump as president-elect, a lot of us are wondering how we got here and what we can do about it. The Democratic Party won¡¯t save us; even ¡®progressives¡¯ like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said they¡¯ll work together with President Trump. Peaceful protest won¡¯t save us ; as Stokely Carmichael said, ¡°Nonviolence only works if your opponent has a conscience. The United States has none.¡± 
The only thing that has stopped fascism historically is an organized anti-fascist fighting force; Hitler was only stopped by the Red Army. The rising wave of fascist movements emboldened by Trump¡¯s presidency can only be countered by an even more bold mass movement of anti-capitalist resistance. Now more than ever, the steps necessary for building this type of mass revolutionary movement need to be made. And only a movement that can create a revolution to end capitalism will burn the oppressive roots from which fascism grows. 
Join the Revolutionary Student Front at Jester A203A (tentative) on 6:30 on Thursday, to talk about the concrete steps necessary in building power on campus as working-class students to create a better world and defend each other from the threat of fascism.¡± 
The Revolutionary Student Front supports the Red Guards Austin, according to this post: Red Guard Austin are friends with the Revolutionary Student Front ¨C Austin 
The Red Guard Austin¡¯s cover photo on Facebook: Red Guards Austin Facebook photo 
The Revolutionarfy Student Front gives tips to protesters who are ¡°new to protests that are more on the disruptive and confrontational side,¡± such as writing the phone number of the National Lawyers Guild on the protester¡¯s arm before the protest. Not surprisingly, the communist agitators do not discourage violence. 
Watch a local CBS affiliate report (mildly) on the arrest: 
The same communist organization attacked Alex Jones during a pro-life rally in May, 2015. 
Watch the video here: 
It is highly unusual for a local news report to identify ¡°activists¡± as members of communist groups, although the majority (if not all) of the recent anti-Trump protests are indeed organized by communists.

Accuracy in Media 
While the media and the Democrats are in disarray over last week¡¯s elections, it looks like President-elect Donald Trump¡¯s honeymoon is over before it even began. While there may have been a few reports in the past week that were simply factual about Trump¡¯s transition team and process, virtually all of the reports in the mainstream media have been negative and even hostile towards Trump, his transition team and his supporters. 
The media meltdown that accompanied Trump¡¯s victory last week has been a sight to behold. How could they have completely missed this outcome?, they wondered. Most of the articles¡ªsuch as those by The Washington Post (sampling, weighting and voter estimation), The New York Times (misunderstanding major swaths of our country), and Pew Research (underestimating Trump¡¯s support and ¡°non-response bias¡±)¡ªattempted to explain away their acknowledged failure. Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager John Podesta are blaming the media, and FBI Director James Comey for his public comments on the ongoing investigation into Hillary¡¯s mishandling of classified information. 
But this misses the larger point. In spite of a thoroughly biased and corrupt news media and popular culture that worked their collective hearts out to rid the country and the world of what they viewed as an uncouth, dangerous egotistical businessman and reality TV star, a significant majority, as measured through our Constitutional system of the Electoral College, chose Trump over Hillary. Yes, Hillary won the popular vote, but that¡¯s not how we elect our president. 
Whether Trump¡¯s campaign was brilliant, or he was running against such a flawed candidate that he pulled off a win in spite of himself, will long be a subject of dispute. But he did just that. Along the way, he knocked off two political dynasties: Bush and Clinton. Through WikiLeaks, the FBI investigation, Project Veritas¡ªwhich revealed ties between the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and various left-wing activist groups that plotted to create violence and havoc at Trump rallies and pursue efforts at voter fraud¡ªthe public learned enough to understand how corrupt and manipulative the Democrat Party and its top leaders had become. 
Another explanation is that Trump was the beneficiary of billions of dollars of free publicity on TV that enabled his victory. But the truth is that at least 90 percent of that attention was negative, intended to make him look bad¡ªand some of it deservedly so. Trump did have conservative talk-radio on his side, and several spokespeople who got considerable air time. He had Sean Hannity¡¯s support, and otherwise fairly balanced coverage on Fox News. 
But for the most part, the media were apoplectic at the outcome of the election. In essence, their narrative was that Trump was beyond the pale, and that reports of Hillary¡¯s actions were exaggerated and false, especially concerning her handling of classified material, and her actions as secretary of state that might have influenced payments to the Clinton Foundation, to Bill Clinton personally, and to allies of the Clintons, such as in Haiti. 
Brian Stelter of CNN¡¯s Reliable Sources said, ¡°Donald Trump was tapping into something that already existed, which was distrust of the media, particularly on the right, but among many Americans who for various reasons distrust the media, partly because they¡¯re told to by conservative talk radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. But Trump exploited that mistrust and deepened it¡­Trump tapped into that anger at the media and made it much, much worse.¡± 
Over at MSNBC, Lawrence O¡¯Donnell called Trump a ¡°tyrant,¡± and said that the Democrats in Congress must do all they can to block him. Rachel Maddow then referred to Trump as ¡°vengeance minded.¡± Not much of a honeymoon. 
I have heard very few complaints about Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson or Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Granted, we don¡¯t really know how many of those who voted for them would have otherwise voted for Hillary, Trump, or stayed home. But, take Michigan, for example. That is the one state that, according to most websites keeping track, still hasn¡¯t been officially called. Trump leads by less than 12,000 votes, while Johnson received 173,000 votes and Stein 50,000. In Wisconsin, Trump won by 27,000, while Johnson received 106,000, and Stein got 31,000. Regarding Florida, Trump won by 120,000, Johnson received 206,000 votes while Stein got 64,000. 
Trump could have lost Wisconsin and Michigan and still have received enough electoral votes to win. But if he also had lost Florida, Hillary would have won. In Pennsylvania, Trump won by 64,000, while Johnson/Stein won 190,000 votes. Remember Ralph Nader in 2000? He earned the wrath of Democrats forever for supposedly preventing Al Gore from winning Florida. But that anger aimed at third-party candidates doesn¡¯t seem to have caught on this year. Despite the many pleas from Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Hillary, and the Obamas to not vote for third party candidates, many did anyway. 
And now, Republicans dominate the political landscape, with 33 governors, 68 of 99 legislative bodies across the country, the House, the Senate and the White House. The left-wing website Daily Kos has published the best graphics that I found on how dramatic the Republican dominance of the political landscape across the country actually is. Currently Republicans outnumber Democrats in the Senate by 52 to 48. But in 2018, Democrats must defend 25 seats (including the two Independent senators who caucus with the Democrats), while the GOP must defend only eight seats. The Democrats thought that bringing out some big guns¡ªformer Sen. Russ Feingold (WI), former Sen. Evan Bayh (IN) and former Gov. Ted Strickland (OH)¡ªwould give them control of the Senate. But all three lost. Hillary is being criticized for never having gone to Wisconsin to campaign, overconfident that she would win it. The Democrat blame game and finger-pointing is only beginning 
Hillary never held an open press conference throughout this entire year. It was always controlled situations whenever she met the press. 
Trump struck a chord with many who haven¡¯t been voting in recent elections through his relentless attacks on the bias and dishonesty of the media, and on the incompetence and corruption of the Obama/Clinton administration. Hillary wrapped herself in Obama¡¯s supposed popularity¡ªhe and Michelle certainly worked hard for her victory, at least in the last month or so¡ªbut in the end, it was to no avail. His appeal to certain voters didn¡¯t transfer to Hillary. 
What is remarkable about Trump¡¯s victory is what he had to overcome to win. Besides the media, two former Republican presidents, Google, Facebook, Pope Francis, pollsters, a money gap ( reports indicate that Hillary raised $380 million more than Trump), Trump¡¯s inexperience, and the complete panoply of pop culture¡ªfrom Lady Gaga to Katy Perry to Miley Cyrus; Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert, everyone on the Comedy Central Channel, many scripted shows such as ¡°Madam Secretary,¡± and LeBron James¡ªthere was active voter fraud, some of which the Public Interest Legal Foundation has documented . And still Trump won. 
The name-calling, caterwauling, crying and disgust will continue on the left, as they figure out how to pick up the pieces and move forward. Roger Aronoff

Accuracy in Media 
With CNN and MSNBC depicting the incoming Trump administration as the advent of a Fourth Reich, it should be obvious that the President-elect will have to go beyond his blistering tweets to cultivating sympathetic media and getting his own message out in a systematic way. But is the Trump transition team up to the job? 
President Obama was ahead of the curve in this regard, having established an office of ¡°Progressive Media and Online Response¡± to cooperate with ¡°progressive¡± media sources. The Hillary Clinton presidential campaign understood this form of ¡°outreach¡± as well, as we saw in the WikiLeaks disclosures of how they colluded with major media outlets and reporters. Trump has used tweets, meetings with the press, official statements, and an occasional video. But much more will be needed if the President-elect hopes to survive the transition with a team in power that can get things done and communicate directly with the American people. 
In addition to Trump¡¯s tweets, which serve a legitimate purpose, the President-elect should consider a position that is comparable to what the Obama administration had, albeit with a focus on conservative and alternative news media. Trump appears to have great confidence in Dan Scavino , who now carries the title of Director of Social Media & Senior Advisor to President-elect Trump. Scavino has a fascinating bio and has worked for Trump nearly half his life, including as the former Executive Vice President and General Manager of Trump National Golf Club, Westchester. But it¡¯s not clear what role he is playing in the presidential transition. 
What Obama did is worth studying. Jesse Lee was named as the White House Director of Progressive Media and Online Response in 2011. He helped Obama win a second term. According to Lee¡¯s bio , he previously worked as Online Programs Director in the White House and in the New Media department for the Presidential Transition team doing online outreach. He also had worked in online communications for the Democratic National Committee leading up to the 2008 election, served as Senior New Media Advisor to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for the 110th Congress, and helped the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee launch its online program from 2004 to 2006. 
His current effort , as special assistant to the president and ¡°director of rapid response,¡± includes dissemination of propaganda points about the greatness of Obamacare and other Obama administration initiatives. 
While the Trump administration is being painted by the media as an extension of the White Power movement, it¡¯s clear that the Democrats, including Obama, are going on the attack. Together, the media and the Democratic Party are functioning as the new obstructionists, determined to thwart progress and destroy the next administration¡¯s nominees. Trump calls the media names and issues tweets, but there doesn¡¯t seem to be much else being done in response to this coordinated assault. 
A group called UltraViolet has placed full-page ads in The Arizona Republic, The Lincoln Star Journal, and The Reno Gazette Journal attacking Republican senators Jeff Flake (AZ), Deb Fischer (NE), and Dean Heller (NV) ¡°for failing to speak out¡± against Trump¡¯s appointment of Stephen Bannon, ¡°a white supremacist and domestic abuser,¡± as chief White House strategist. The first charge is apparently a reference to Bannon¡¯s Breitbart News having covered groups which talk about protecting the European heritage and Judeo-Christian traditions of the United States and other Western nations. Some of these groups are controversial and out of the conservative mainstream. But the idea that they are in favor of white supremacy is ludicrous. The ¡°domestic abuser¡± charge against Bannon was dismissed as a spurious accusation made by an angry spouse in a divorce case. 
Significantly, UltraViolet is run by Nita Chaudhary, who is married to Obama White House official Jesse Lee. She served as the Democratic National Committee¡¯s first Director of Online during the 2004 cycle and started her career at People for the American Way. She was also the National Campaigns and Organizing Director at MoveOn.org Political Action. 
Publicly, Democrats are saying that they intend to work with the Trump administration on some issues. Consider that the University of Arizona just took out a full-page ad in Politico, advertising a statement from the ¡° National Institute for Civil Discourse ,¡± whose members include such prominent Democrats as former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, a Professor of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley. The statement signed by Reich and others says Americans should move beyond the ¡°bitter¡± election and ¡°ensure that America¡¯s next chapter is civil and respectful¡­¡± 
Despite talk of ¡°civil discourse,¡± Reich has just written a column titled, ¡°The Trump Administration Will Be the Most Dangerous Since Richard Nixon.¡± And he writes this before Trump takes office! 
Rather than take a wait-and-see attitude, Reich has also written a column , ¡°The First 100 Day Resistance Agenda,¡± in which he advises, ¡°Get Democrats in the Congress and across the country to pledge to oppose Trump¡¯s agenda. Prolong the process of approving choices, draw out hearings, stand up as sanctuary cities and states.¡± He also suggests, ¡°Boycott all Trump products, real estate, hotels, resorts, everything. And then boycott all stores (like Nordstrom) that carry merchandise from Trump family brands.¡± 
Reich is a Democrat double-talker who puts his name on a statement promising peace and harmony, while telling the far-left to do everything possible to obstruct and destroy the next administration. 
Reich¡¯s double-talk will not be worthy of any media scrutiny, of course. 
One way to overcome this onslaught is to continue to go on the offensive, not only against the media but also the media¡¯s darlings, such as Hillary Clinton. When the liberal media see that Trump is apparently backing away from holding Mrs. Clinton accountable for her corruption, they know they are winning the information war and that they have the President-elect on the run. 
Meeting personally with The New York Times, as Trump did on Tuesday, will not mollify his critics. The media will see such a meeting as a sign of weakness. He needs to reach out to allies in the media who are willing to cover him and his administration in a fair and objective manner. Another way to do this is to open up the White House press briefings of his new administration to conservative bloggers and media outlets. There¡¯s no reason to reserve front-row seats for what he once called the ¡°crooked media.¡± Let them stand in the back with their hands raised. Cliff Kincaid

Will years of alleged fraud at the CDC get more attention in the Trump administration? 7 reasons CDC employees should be ¡°crying in the hallways¡± PORTLAND, Oregon?¡ª? Question : The day after Donald Trump¡¯s unexpected win in the presidential election last week, how many government agencies had reports in the media of their employees ¡°crying in the hallways¡±? Answer : Exactly one. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which is based in Atlanta, GA. As a long-time critic of the CDC, I was pretty shocked to see this headline last week, courtesy of Atlanta¡¯s NPR radio station, 90.1 WABE: Atlanta CDC Employees Express Anxiety Over Trump¡¯s Win The story detailed the climate at CDC the day after the election: 
¡°At the General Muir deli across the street from the CDC, a few employees talked to WABE, asking that their names not be used. One microbiologist said her colleagues were crying in the hallways.¡± ¡°It¡¯s really sad,¡± she said. ¡°It¡¯s depressing. I¡¯m eating a bagel to try and be happy.¡± 
See: http://news.wabe.org/post/atlanta-cdc-employees-express-anxiety-over-trumps-win 
The average voter?¡ª?even a Trump supporter?¡ª?probably has no idea why CDC employees might be ¡°crying in the hallways,¡± while the average autism parent (meaning those of us who have children with autism) like me understands it perfectly. Frankly, it¡¯s pretty hard for me to write about the CDC without shaking with at least a little bit of rage. On the off chance this is your first time considering this topic, I¡¯ll steady my hands and explain it to you: Source: learntherisk.org The CDC is in charge of recommending the vaccination schedule for U.S. children, which has grown from 5 total doses in the 1960s to more than 70 today. The CDC is ALSO in charge of monitoring vaccine safety for those more than 70 doses. In an ironic twist (at least for parents like me), the CDC is ALSO in charge of tracking the number of children with Autism in the U.S., a number that has grown from 1 in 10,000 in the 1980s to 1 in 68 today. For many autism parents, the CDC being in charge of both implementing the vaccine schedule and monitoring the safety of vaccines has always felt like an extreme conflict of interest. And, we were never alone in that feeling. 10 years ago, two members of Congress, Representatives Dave Weldon and Carolyn Maloney, tried to pass a bill to separate vaccine safety from the CDC: 
From the press release for the bill: Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney 
At a press conference Wednesday morning, U.S. Reps. Dave Weldon, M.D. (R-FL) and Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced a bill that would give responsibility for the nation¡¯s vaccine safety to an independent agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, removing most vaccine safety research from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Currently, the CDC has responsibility for both vaccine safety and promotion, which is an inherent conflict of interest increasingly garnering public criticism. Congressman Dave Weldon, M.D. ¡°There¡¯s an enormous inherent conflict of interest within the CDC and if we fail to move vaccine safety to a separate independent office, safety issues will remain a low priority and public confidence in vaccines will continue to erode,¡± said Weldon, noting that across the federal government similar conflicts of interests have been remedied, but with regard to mandatory childhood vaccines the conflict continues to persist unchecked. ¡°This bill will provide the independence necessary to ensure that vaccine safety research is robust, unbiased, and broadly accepted by the public at large.¡± ¡°Vaccines do wonders for public health, but when the government requires them, it must also ensure that they¡¯re safe,¡± said Maloney. ¡°We need adequate, unbiased research on vaccines, and this legislation would deliver that. I applaud Dr. Weldon for his tremendous commitment to and leadership on this issue. He is truly dedicated to protecting our children and the public at large.¡± See: https://maloney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/weldon-maloney-introduce-vaccine-safety-bill Alas, like every bill intended to reduce the power and influence of the CDC, the bill never passed. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a well-known environmental activist and progeny of one of the most famous political families in the world, has spoken with force about the conflict problems at CDC: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. ¡°The CDC is a captive agency. The vaccine agency has become a subsidiary of big pharma. Vaccines are a $30 billion industry, an increasing profit center. They have been able to compromise all checks and balances that once protected children.¡± ¨C Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. For parents uncertain as to where CDC¡¯s loyalties lie, the departure of the previous head of CDC?¡ª?Julie Gerberding?¡ª?to a well-paying job as President of the vaccine division of Merck , the largest vaccine maker in the world, made many of us permanently cynical: ¡°Dr. Julie Gerberding, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was named president of Merck & Co Inc¡¯s vaccine division, the company said on Monday. Gerberding, who led the CDC from 2002 to 2009, stepped down when President Barack Obama took office.¡±

In my opinion, it¡¯s going to get far worse before it gets better for the CDC, and here¡¯s 7 reasons why: Reason #1: The CDC just got outed last month by its own scientists complaining that CDC¡¯s ¡°mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and rogue interests.¡± From the Huffington Post on October 17, 2016: Concerns about the inner workings of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been mounting in recent months amid disclosures of cozy corporate alliances. Now a group of more than a dozen senior scientists have reportedly lodged an ethics complaint alleging the federal agency is being influenced by corporate and political interests in ways that short-change taxpayers¡­ ¡°It appears that our mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and rogue interests¡­ and Congressional intent for our agency is being circumvented by some of our leaders. What concerns us most, is that it is becoming the norm and not the rare exception,¡± the letter states. ¡°These questionable and unethical practices threaten to undermine our credibility and reputation as a trusted leader in public health.¡± See: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carey-gillam/spider-bites-cdc-ethics-c_b_12525012.html The scientists?¡ª?who chose to remain anonymous for fear of retribution (never a good reflection on an agency¡¯s culture)?¡ª?published a complete letter with their complaints that you can read here : ¡°We are often directed to do things we know are not right.¡± ¡ª CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics in Research (CDC SPIDER) Reason #2: CDC has a whistleblower scientist¡ª Dr. William Thompson?¡ª?alleging that CDC scientists destroyed data that showed a link between the MMR vaccine and autism This is a serious allegation, especially because Dr. Thompson is the principal author of a number of the studies used to ¡°prove¡± vaccines ¡°don¡¯t cause autism¡± released by CDC. From former CBS journalist Sharyl Attkisson: A current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) senior scientist has made an unprecedented admission: he and his colleagues¨Che says¨C committed scientific misconduct to cover up a meaningful link between vaccines and autism in black boys. Just as startling, the CDC scientist, Dr. William Thompson, says the study co-authors ¡°scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to the study. The remaining four co-authors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting room, and reviewed and went through all the hardcopy documents that we had thought we should discard, and put them into a huge garbage can.¡± The¡­co-authors¡­brought a big garbage can into the meeting room¡­ [and put the documents]¡­into a huge garbage can. ¨C CDC Senior Scientist Dr. William Thompson 
See: https://sharylattkisson.com/cdc-scientist-we-scheduled-meeting-to-destroy-vaccine-autism-study-documents/ ¡°A huge garbage can¡±? Did he really say that? Yes, he really did, and one of our Congressmen?¡ª?Representative Bill Posey of Florida?¡ª?repeated Dr. Thompson¡¯s words in Congressional testimony: Reason #3: CDC has another whistleblower alleging that CDC¡¯s gathering of autism prevalence numbers has been fraudulent From the The Alliance for Human Research Protection website: On April 4, 2016, Dr. Judith Pinborough-Zimmerman, the former Principal Investigator for the CDC¡¯s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network (ADDM) in Utah, filed a whistleblower lawsuit in the U.S. District Court. Dr. Zimmerman charged University of Utah researchers for CDC¡¯s Network with ¡°publishing data under people¡¯s names who had not done the work and that the data contained uncorrected errors.¡± ¡°Depositions from Zimmerman and her former colleagues suggest that the alleged data errors were serious and have the potential to produce major differences in reported Utah autism rates. In the 2008 ADDM Network Report, Utah autism rates were the highest in the country at 1 in 47. In the 2012 report released today, Utah rates plummeted nearly 20% to 1 in 58 as most other ADDM Network sites reported either rising or stable autism rates.¡± See: http://ahrp.org/lawsuit-by-principal-investigator-for-cdc-utah-autism-data-filed-whistleblower-lawsuit/ Health Choice, an advocacy organization, explains why Ms. Zimmerman¡¯s allegations are so serious: ¡°The CDC has been misrepresenting the alarming rise in autism rates since the late 1980s,¡± says Health Choice Executive Leadership Team Chairman Mark Blaxill. His Health Choice analysis, ¡°The Autism Emergency Continues¡±, released today outlines a number of criticisms of the CDC¡¯s surveillance program. ¡°They have selected a partial and unrepresentative sample of states to track, changed the sample in a biased fashion over the years, and then take too long to report out the data. Today¡¯s 2012 report is over a decade behind the problem, giving us autism rates for children born twelve years ago.¡± ¡°If the sharp increases in autism rates began in the late 1980s,¡± asks Blaxill, ¡°why would CDC design a tracking survey beginning with the 1992 birth year? Elsewhere, they¡¯ve published data with very low rates from the late 1980s in New Jersey and Georgia but don¡¯t connect the dots in the ADDM publications from today¡¯s 1 in 68 rate back to these earlier numbers.¡± ¡°Health Choice is very worried that the CDC¡¯s ADDM Network reporting is not accurately representing the seriousness of the autism epidemic. For most affected individuals, autism is a lifelong disability, a condition that frequently wreaks havoc on families, school systems, and state resources.¡± Mr. Blaxill went on to say, ¡°since 1990, autism rates have exploded: something new and terrible is happening to a generation of children. It¡¯s time to for the CDC stop sugar coating the inconvenient facts and confess that we have a national emergency so we can finally get to the bottom of this tragic problem.¡± Reason #3A: One of the authors of the ¡°Danish Studies¡± exonerating thimerosal¡¯s (a mercury preservative) role in Autism is wanted by the CDC for embezzlement (Author¡¯s note: the failure to mention Poul Thorsen was brought up to me by an attentive reader. It¡¯s hard to keep track of so much malfeasance!) I¡¯m just glad I can prove this one with other articles, it¡¯s almost too much to believe: Researcher who dispelled vaccine-autism link: ¡°Most-wanted fugitive¡± This is on the HHS website, right now! ¡°A former Centers for Disease Control (CDC) researcher, best known for his frequently-cited studies dispelling a link between vaccines and autism, is still considered on the lam after allegedly using CDC grants of tax dollars to buy a house and cars for himself. ¡°Most wanted fugitive¡± CDC researcher Poul Thorsen published studies dispelling a link between vaccines and autism Poul Thorsen, listed as a most-wanted fugitive by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, was discredited in April 2011 when he was indicted on 13 counts of wire fraud and nine counts of money laundering. Some have argued that his alleged fraudulent behavior calls into question the validity of his studies. There is no indication the studies have been retracted to date.¡± See: https://sharylattkisson.com/researcher-who-dispelled-vaccine-autism-link-most-wanted-fugitive/ I can¡¯t make this stuff up! Here¡¯s another article about Poul Thorsen from Robert F. Kennedy, Jr: Central Figure in CDC Vaccine Cover-Up Absconds With $2M 
See: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr/central-figure-in-cdc-vac_b_494303.html Reason #4: Two Merck whistleblowers are alleging that the Mumps vaccine doesn¡¯t work very well, and that Merck knew that and fudged the data Remember the former CDC head (Julie Gerberding) who went to go work at the Merck vaccine division? Yup, it really is that ugly¡­ See: http://philadelphia.legalexaminer.com/fda-prescription-drugs/massive-fraud-in-merck-mmr-vaccine-testing/ ¡°A U.S. judge rejected Merck¡¯s attempt at a dismissal after determining there was plausible grounds for the claims. Therefore the medical giant is being forced to defend themselves and their vaccine in at least two federal cases. Merck could also be forced to defend itself in Congress. Representative Bill Posey (R-FL)?¡ª?a known critic of the CDC whom is investigating the link between autism and vaccines?¡ª?is reviewing hundreds of documents turned over by the CDC whistleblower.¡± According to the whistleblowers¡¯ court documents, Merck¡¯s misconduct was far-ranging: It ¡°failed to disclose that its mumps vaccine was not as effective as Merck represented, (ii) used improper testing techniques, (iii) manipulated testing methodology, (iv) abandoned undesirable test results, (v) falsified test data, (vi) failed to adequately investigate and report the diminished efficacy of its mumps vaccine, (vii) falsely verified that each manufacturing lot of mumps vaccine would be as effective as identified in the labeling, (viii) falsely certified the accuracy of applications filed with the FDA, (ix) falsely certified compliance with the terms of the CDC purchase contract, (x) engaged in the fraud and concealment describe herein for the purpose of illegally monopolizing the U.S. market for mumps vaccine, (xi) mislabeled, misbranded, and falsely certified its mumps vaccine, and (xii) engaged in the other acts described herein to conceal the diminished efficacy of the vaccine the government was purchasing.¡± ¡°The fraudulent activities, say the whistleblowers, were designed to produce test results that would meet the FDA¡¯s requirement that the mumps vaccine was 95 percent effective.¡± Reason #5: Just yesterday, a local Atlanta TV station explained to the world what the vaccine court is and that it¡¯s not working Definitive book on the vaccine court. Never heard of the Vaccine Court? You¡¯re not alone. This is the first news story I¡¯ve ever seen mentioning and criticizing the court, and it¡¯s from an Atlanta TV station! From WSB-TV: ¡°A federal program designed to help victims suffering from life-altering reactions to vaccines is falling short on promises made when it started. It¡¯s called the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a $3.6 billion fund created to take care of victims with catastrophic reactions to vaccines. But a Channel 2 Action News investigation found it also protects vaccine-makers from being subject to lawsuits. And they don¡¯t pay for the program?¡ª?you do.¡± 
See: http://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/investigates/3b-program-to-help-vaccine-victims-falls-short-on-promises/467245775 Reason #6: A published study shows that 83 cases from vaccine court (see above) compensated children with autism for vaccine injury So, let me get this straight: A senior scientist from the CDC who authored many of the studies ¡°proving¡± vaccines don¡¯t cause autism says they threw away data in a big garbage can that showed a connection between vaccines and autism¡­ A group of lawyers then reviewed records from the vaccine court and found children with autism are being compensated by the court for vaccine injury causing their autism¡­ ¡­Are we sure vaccines can¡¯t cause autism? 
Read: Pace Environmental Law Review 
¡°For over 20 years, the federal government has publicly denied a vaccine-autism link, while at the same time its Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has been awarding damages for vaccine injury to children with brain damage, seizures and autism. A new investigation, based on verifiable government data, breaks ground in the controversial vaccine-autism debate. The investigation found that a substantial number of children compensated for vaccine injury also have autism and that such cases have existed since 1989, the year after the VICP was formed.¡± 
SafeMinds¡¯ Executive Director, Lyn Redwood, RN, MSN comments, ¡°This study dramatically shifts the debate on autism and vaccines. The question is no longer, Can vaccines cause autism? The answer is clear. Now, we have to ask, How many cases of autism have vaccines caused and how do we prevent new injuries from occurring?¡± The government has asserted that it ¡°does not track¡± autism among the vaccine-injured. SafeMinds responds that not looking is the easiest way not to find something. SafeMinds is calling for immediate federal research into the mechanisms of injury in these children in an effort to protect other children from harm and Congressional action to reform the VICP. Reason #7: President-Elect Trump appears to know the truth about vaccines and autism, and he¡¯s not afraid to say it! Yes, I saved the best for last. If you¡¯re an autism parent, you already knew this one. But, Donald Trump has been speaking the truth about what happened to our kids for years. The first I heard of President-elect Trump¡¯s understanding of this issue was back in December 2007: TRUMP SPEAKS: ¡°I THINK IT¡¯S THE VACCINATIONS¡± 
See: http://www.ageofautism.com/2007/12/trump-speaks¨C1.html What if you were a large national autism charity and you held a fundraiser at a billionaire¡¯s house and the billionaire told reporters he thought autism was caused by vaccines? What if your large national autism charity was wildly dismissive of vaccines as a cause for autism, had scientists on staff who had worked to produce faulty research exonerating vaccines alongside the CDC, and had no research dollars allocated to exploring the vaccine-autism relationship? Well, then you would be Autism Speaks holding a fundraiser at Donald Trump¡¯s Palm Beach mansion. As THIS article from the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reports: ¡°At a news conference Thursday in a gold-trimmed Mar-A-Lago ballroom, Trump¡¯s wife, Melania, noted her 22-month-old son, Baron, and said: ¡°I cannot imagine what the mothers [with autistic children] and mothers all around the world go through. ¡­ Let¡¯s get rid of autism.¡± In an interview, Donald Trump said he thinks the rising prevalence of autism is related to vaccinations of babies and toddlers. One in 150 children is now diagnosed with autism, with the prevalence higher among boys. ¡°When I was growing up, autism wasn¡¯t really a factor,¡± he [Trump] said. ¡°And now all of a sudden, it¡¯s an epidemic. Everybody has their theory, and my theory is the shots. They¡¯re getting these massive injections at one time. I think it¡¯s the vaccinations .¡± As you may know, President-elect Trump¡¯s statements have only gotten bolder since then. Or how about his words during this appearance on Fox News? Thank you for your honesty, President-elect Trump. Crying through the hallways at CDC? I think the crying has just begun.

One of the biggest myths being propagated in the compliant mainstream media today is that doctors are either pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, and that the anti-vaccine doctors are all ¡°quacks.¡± 
However, nothing could be further from the truth in the vaccine debate. Doctors are not unified at all on their positions regarding ¡°the science¡± of vaccines, nor are they unified in the position of removing informed consent to a medical procedure like vaccines. 
The two most extreme positions are those doctors who are 100% against vaccines and do not administer them at all, and those doctors that believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective for ALL people, ALL the time, by force if necessary. 
Very few doctors fall into either of these two extremist positions, and yet it is the extreme pro-vaccine position that is presented by the U.S. Government and mainstream media as being the dominant position of the medical field. 
In between these two extreme views, however, is where the vast majority of doctors practicing today would probably categorize their position. Many doctors who consider themselves ¡°pro-vaccine,¡± for example, do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual. 
Many doctors recommend a ¡°delayed¡± vaccine schedule for some patients, and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule. Other doctors choose to recommend vaccines based on the actual science and merit of each vaccine, recommending some, while determining that others are not worth the risk for children, such as the suspect seasonal flu shot. 
These doctors who do not hold extreme positions would be opposed to government-mandated vaccinations and the removal of all parental exemptions. 
In this eBook, I am going to summarize the many doctors today who do not take the most extremist pro-vaccine position, which is probably not held by very many doctors at all, in spite of what the pharmaceutical industry, the federal government, and the mainstream media would like the public to believe.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/president-elect-trump-new-era-of.html President Elect Trump is new title for New York businessman, millionaire and Republican candidate Donald J. Trump, who yesterday on November 8th, 2016 successfully won the US presidential election. Trump managed to defeat favorite Hillary Clinton by a relatively narrow margin. The victory came as a shock to many Americans, regardless of where they reside on the political spectrum. For many in the alternative media, the victory of President Elect Trump comes with a great sense of relief that career criminal Hillary Clinton was not elected (or installed) as so many had expected. Clinton had already showed a propensity to collude, cheat and lie during the Democratic Primaries where she triumphed with dirty tactics over Bernie Sanders.For many others, turned off by Trump¡¯s racism, sexism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and generally flippant comments, the Trump victory is devastating and will challenge them psychologically and emotionally to accept the reality for the results. Hillary Clinton: What Went Wrong? The result is especially surprising given the degree to which Hillary Clinton had ingratiated herself with the upper echelons of the NWO ( New World Order ). From an outside perspective, it seemed Clinton had left no stone unturned in brown-nosing and sucking up to the most powerful people and organizations in the world, including the Rothschilds , Goldman Sachs, the Rockefeller CFR ( Council on Foreign Relations ) and many many more. Additionally, given her propensity for criminality and her powerful backers such as George Soros , coupled with the serious problems electronic voting machines possess in being able to be hacked and the vote flipped, many are left wondering how Hillary lost . What went wrong? At this stage in the game of post-election analysis, we can point to a few things. Hillary¡¯s criminal past clearly caught up with her. It is unprecedented in the history of US presidential elections for a leading candidate to be under an on-again, off-again criminal investigation. Clinton simply has so many scandals in her recent and distant past that it¡¯s like trying to stop a ship with 30 holes from sinking; you can¡¯t plug them all. She was also running up against the problem that the Democrats had been in power for 8 years, when recent history shows that power seems to change hands in around that time frame. Clinton represented the establishment, and as the popularity of both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump has shown, people are tired of the same. They intuitively know the system is rigged and corrupt, even if they can¡¯t exactly put their fingers on it. Obama, Mr. ¡°Hope and Change¡±, got in with a slick campaign of promising something different (upon which he didn¡¯t deliver). Trump represented anti-establishment, and whether he truly embodies that or not is an entirely different matter, because it¡¯s all about perception. Does a Trump Victory Show that NWO Powerbrokers Are Less in Control than It Seems? The win of President Elect Trump is truly shocking and monumental event. Many people (including myself) were predicting that it was a foregone conclusion that Clinton would win. For instance, founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange stated before the election that ¡°Trump would not permitted to win¡±. The MSM ( Mainstream Media ) were clearly favoring Clinton at almost every turn. Whatever you think of Trump, we can at least say the will of the majority of American voters was respected, which is a relief, given how much corruption exists in our society today.The question now is this: is a Trump victory the result the NWO powerbrokers wanted all along, for reasons we are yet to see? Or is it a genuine uprising against these forces? What Does a Trump Presidency Mean for Liberty and Freedom? For me, Trump can be summarized in one word: unpredictable . President Elect Trump truly embodies unpredictability more than any other high-level politician around. One moment he is railing against the 9/11 official story, then he is declaring his love for Israel, then he is bringing up the vaccine-autism connection, then he is suggesting Snowden be killed. Next he is suggesting GMO corn makes you stupid, then he suggesting Muslims be banned from the US, then he is calling global warming a hoax , then he is suggesting the Government be given the power to shut down the internet. Then, after all of that, he makes friendly overtures to Russia while demonizing the hell out of Iran. What does he stand for? Peace or war? Freedom or tyranny?At this stage no one knows, probably not even Trump himself. He has contradicted himself numerous times throughout his campaign, and merely once suggesting a good idea (i.e. looking at who controls the issuance of money instead of letting the international bankers via the Federal Reserve control it) doesn¡¯t mean it will become his policy. Unpredictability is one of Trump¡¯s great qualities, but also one of his most dangerous. A lot will depend on with whom he surrounds himself once becoming President Trump, and what kind of advice they give him. His VP Mike Pence is a standard conservative Republican who will be no doubt far more to the liking of the NWO conspirators, but Trump is also taking advice from retired DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) chief Michael Flynn, the man who came out and highlighted how the US created ISIS in a declassified DIA document .For now, America and the world have around two-and-a-half months to get over the incredible shock of yesterday¡¯s result and psychologically prepare itself for a Trump presidency. Meanwhile, it would be foolish for us to expect that one man can fix all of America¡¯s problems. It will be the job of the independent and alternative media to hold Trump to his promises and his word, and to continue to share ideas of how we can truly create a better, freer and more just society. This necessarily involves questioning the very structures and systems of society, and will never magically improve with just the passing of the baton from one politician to another.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/billionaire-globalist-soros-exposed-as.html Billionaire globalist financier George Soros¡¯ MoveOn.org has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump ¡ª exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down operation ¡ª and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media. Wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least 10 major U.S. cities. Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Ore., St. Paul, Minn., Seattle, and several other cities saw protests, according to USA Today. In light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of Trump, a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether it¡¯s an organic grassroots movement, or something much more organized, sophisticated and potentially dangerous. Soros¡¯ affiliated organization MoveOn.org released the following press release yesterday afternoon: ""Americans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity, Resistance, and Resolve Following Election Results""Hundreds of Americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the White House and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia.""Tonight, thousands of Americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation, including outside the White House, following the results of Tuesday¡¯s presidential election.""The gatherings ¨C organized by MoveOn.org and allies ¨C will affirm a continued rejection of Donald Trump¡¯s bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible.""Within two hours of the call-to-action, MoveOn members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow on Wednesday afternoon."" Now come reports from various protest locations that reveal a substantially coordinated effort, and not the organic grassroots showing by concerned Americans, as the mainstream media is reporting. Photos from Austin, Texas reveal a line of busses the ¡°protestors¡± arrived in, making their appearance seem substantially less than organic ¨C with a direct implication of being strategically orchestrated. Anti-Trump protestors in Austin today are not as organic as they seem. Here are the busses they came in. #fakeprotests #trump2016 #austin pic.twitter.com/VxhP7t6OUI ¡ª erictucker (@erictucker) November 10, 2016 With evidence mounting, the question must be asked; is George Soros working through his front organizations to foment an American revolution? @BeshoyBadie @desjax @erictucker Pretty evident that the signs were printed by Soros and Creamer groups. IIRC Soros linked w/ MB & Huma pic.twitter.com/KgXvIQr2b8 ¡ª MEGATRON (@MEGATRONs_SMIRK) November 10, 2016 Note that the group is actively organizing protests to a democratic election that no one is contesting the legitimacy of in terms of whether the vote was rigged, etc. Essentially, they are displeased with the results and are calling for people to rise up and not accept the results. For an organization that feigns to promote democracy, their actions speak otherwise. ¡°This is a disaster. We fought our hearts out to avert this reality. But now it¡¯s here,¡± MoveOn.org staff wrote to members on Wednesday. ¡°The new president-elect and many of his most prominent supporters have targeted, demeaned, and threatened millions of us¡ªand millions of our friends, family, and loved ones. Both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands. ¡°We are entering an era of profound and unprecedented challenge, a time of danger for our communities and our country. In this moment, we have to take care of ourselves, our families, and our friends¡ªespecially those of us who are on the front lines facing hate, including Latinos, women, immigrants, refugees, Black people, Muslims, LGBT Americans, and so many others. And we need to make it clear that we will continue to stand together.¡± Perhaps the most absurd part of the protests is that President-elect Trump hasn¡¯t made a single policy decision yet ¡ª and, in fact, the entire section of his website regarding banning Muslims was scrubbed shortly after his election. This denotes that anything said during the campaign was most likely simple election campaign rhetoric and subsequent framing of said rhetoric by the opposition. The left wing organization is one of a number of progressive organizations affiliated with Soros¡¯ Open Society Foundation. Soros-affiliated organizations across the world are deeply connected to various color revolutions, the Arab Spring, and a number of other political uprisings across the globe. According to a report in New Eastern Outlook : ""The totality of what is revealed in the three hacked documents show that Soros is effectively the puppet-master pulling most of the strings in Kiev. Soros Foundation¡¯s Ukraine branch, International Renaissance Foundation (IRF) has been involved in Ukraine since 1989. ""His IRF doled out more than $100 million to Ukrainian NGOs two years before the fall of the Soviet Union, creating the preconditions for Ukraine¡¯s independence from Russia in 1991. Soros also admitted to financing the 2013-2014 Maidan Square protests that brought the current government into power.""Soros¡¯ foundations were also deeply involved in the 2004 Orange Revolution that brought the corrupt but pro-NATO Viktor Yushchenko into power with his American wife who had been in the US State Department. ""In 2004 just weeks after Soros¡¯ International Renaissance Foundation had succeeded in getting Viktor Yushchenko as President of Ukraine, Michael McFaul wrote an OpEd for the Washington Post. McFaul, a specialist in organizing color revolutions, who later became US Ambassador to Russia, revealed:""Did Americans meddle in the internal affairs of Ukraine? Yes. The American agents of influence would prefer different language to describe their activities ¡ª democratic assistance, democracy promotion, civil society support, etc. ¡ª but their work, however labeled, seeks to influence political change in Ukraine."" Anyone familiar with the history of the Soros Open Society Foundations in Eastern Europe and around the world since the late 1980¡¯s, will know that his supposedly philanthropic ¡°democracy-building¡± projects in Poland, Russia, or Ukraine in the 1990¡¯s allowed Soros the businessman to literally plunder the former communist countries¡¯ wealth, according to the New Eastern Outlook. During the 2016 presidential cycle, Soros committed $25 million dollars to the 2016 campaign of Hillary Clinton. Per the standard Clinton operating procedure, this was indicative of the symbiotic relationship of favors between the billionaire and his array of political puppets across the globe. As a testament to the power wielded by Soros, contained within WikiLeaks¡¯ recent release of hacked DNC emails, is a message from billionaire globalist financier George Soros to Hillary Clinton while she was U.S. Secretary of State, that clearly reveals Clinton as a Soros puppet. Found within the WikiLeaks¡¯ Hillary Clinton email archive is an email with the subject ¡® Unrest in Albania ,¡¯ in which Soros makes clear to Clinton that ¡° two things need to be done urgently .¡± The Clinton-Podesta Email Scandal is All About SATANISM and Pedophilia: 'Sacrificing a Chicken to Moloch' He then directs the Secretary of State to ¡° bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha ¡± and ¡° appoint a senior European official as mediator .¡± Revealing the influence he wields within the corridors of power, Soros then provides Secretary of State Clinton with three names from which to choose. Unsurprisingly, Clinton acquiesced and chose one of the officials recommended by Soros ¡ª Miroslav Lajcak. Make no mistake that the events you¡¯re seeing transpire nationwide are being orchestrated in part by a billionaire political elite class that is looking to subvert the will of the American people by attempting to foment a new American revolution. Soros¡¯ formula has been duplicated in numerous nations, and it looks as if he now has the U.S. in his sights as the next target.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/russell-brand-brilliantly-explains.html The mixed reactions over the election results is certainly no secret. Some are terrified and devastated, others are joyous, feeling hopeful and are starting to think the elite lost some control on this one. Russell Brand had some rather interesting insight that resonated deeply with me as it¡¯s precisely what I¡¯ve been sharing since the night of the election: don¡¯t lose hope. More on that below, but first please read this important perspective. The fact Trump ¡®got in¡¯ shows that, more than anything, people really want change. They are tired of the same old stuff, and enough was brought to the surface about how corrupt Hillary is that people wanted to try something different.During the tail end of election night, as social media lit up, I remember feeling that the election result and the Brexit result brought forth very similar reactions. Many did what the media told them to do and simply began calling out ¡®the stupid people, racist people and uneducated people!¡¯ But the truth is, we won¡¯t see the world clearly with that worldview, we¡¯re being challenged to expand our consciousness here and I for one believe that is our course of action. Bernie Blues All in hindsight! Although Bernie had the popular vote before, Hillary, the DNC and the media worked to knock him out. Now more than ever everyone wants Bernie back, and while people think it¡¯s a mistake that he didn¡¯t get in, it¡¯s not. It¡¯s perfect. because that¡¯s what it took to get people to realize the system is rigged . You see, you can¡¯t pick and choose when to say that ¡®everything happens for a reason¡¯ and that ¡®everything is perfect¡¯ and ¡®consciousness creates reality¡¯ etc. Those are universal truths that remain true regardless of what is taking place. When something doesn¡¯t go our way we fall out of awareness and into ego. We begin burying ourselves in emotion. It would be better, instead, to accept what happened and begin asking why? And how? What can we learn from this and why did we co-create this reality? Think about it, what is more important given our incredibly messed up situation? Having another president we feel OK about or now having the world know that the elections are rigged? There is a corrupt elite running our world and that now sets the stage for discussion on where we can go from here. It is imperative that we come to terms with and understand our current state without turning a blind eye to what¡¯s really going on. If we don¡¯t do that, we won¡¯t be able to come up with solutions that truly work. Shifting consciousness includes seeing things clearly and learning the lesson this cycle is trying to teach us. (...) What Now? So where do we go from here? What¡¯s next? Well, the first step is to process the emotions and the fear that¡¯s getting in the way of us seeing the truth. If we keep getting caught up in them, we¡¯re only going to create even more problems ¡ª which is our choice. But ask yourself if you feel it¡¯s necessary to do this given that a quick shift in awareness can help us see more clearly and help us begin a different set of discussions. The next step would be having the conversation about the elephant in the room: it¡¯s troubling that after all these years, we still show up at the polling stations to vote for a system that doesn¡¯t have the people¡¯s interests in mind and that is only making things worse as each year goes by. With a shift in consciousness and awareness, we can start creating something new .

In a series of tweets and ... http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/cdc-scientist-confirms-donald-trump-is.html Donald Trump is no stranger to controversy, including the vaccine debate. In a series of tweets and interviews over the past few years, the presidential candidate has stated that he strongly believes that there is a link between ""monstrous"" vaccines and autism . He has suggested that delivering vaccines in smaller doses over time could reduce autism rates among U.S. children. Despite being cast to the lunatic fringe by the mainstream media for his remarks, CDC scientist Dr. William Thompson has confirmed Trump's suspicions ¡ª namely, that   autism is real .Congressman Bill Posey from Florida helped expose the corruption of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) . He recently read a statement on the House floor written by CDC scientist Dr. William Thompson.In the statement, Dr. Thompson admitted to omitting data from a study which showed that autism rates were higher among African American boys who received the MMR vaccination before the age of three.(1) ""Regardless of the subject matter, parents making decisions about their children's health deserve to have the best information available to them. ""They should be able to count on federal agencies to tell them the truth. For these reasons, I bring the following matter to the House floor,"" Posey stated.(2) He then proceeded to read the statement provided by Dr. Thompson. The statement pertained to a 2004 study published in the journal Pediatrics. The doctor revealed that he and his colleagues intentionally destroyed data in the study which showed that African American MMR-vaccinated boys under the age of three had   for autism. According to the whistleblower, the CDC held a meeting of scientists to discuss whether they should destroy the evidence. The authors decided to scrap their findings. Fortunately, Dr. Thompson saved computer files and hard copies of the omitted data for legal reasons.(3) ""Mr. Speaker, I believe it is our duty to insure that the documents that Dr. Thompson are not ignored. Therefore I will provide them to members of Congress and the House Committees upon request. ""Considering the nature of the whistleblower's documents as well as the involvement of the CDC, a hearing and a thorough investigation is warranted,"" Posey concluded.(2) Because the report pertains to vaccines, the mainstream media continues to ignore these revelations. Meanwhile, they continue to parade Donald Trump as a kook for suggesting that there is a link   The double standard boggles the mind and sickens the stomach.Trump hasn't backed down from the vaccine debate despite the mainstream media's backlash against his remarks. In 2015, he appeared on the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham's show stating: ""I've known people that had totally magnificent children, functioning a hundred percent, everything beautiful, smart as a whip, and they go for this shot and get this shot of this massive dose, of everything at one time, and they end up with horrible autism.""(4) In addition, Trump stated on a Fox News television program in 2012: ""I've seen people where they have a perfectly healthy child, and they go for the vaccinations and a month later the child is no longer healthy.""(5) Trump made similar remarks in a series of tweets in 2014, after a CDC report revealed that autism rates in U.S. children had increased by 30 percent in the last two years.(6)The CDC report that coincided with Trump's tweets did not actually state what caused the spike in autism rates. Given Dr. Thompson's recent testimony, however, it's easy to think of at least one possibility. By S.

I think it¡¯s very low on the list,¡± Trump said on the Hugh Hewitt show, indicating a major shift in U.S. policy. Trump continued: ¡°You know in the 1920s people talked about global cooling, they thought the earth was cooling. I believe there is weather and I believe there is change and I believe it goes up and it goes down and it goes up again and it changes depending on years and centuries.¡° Pointing out that U.S. manufacturing and the economy as a whole has suffered since climate change rules were introduced by global organizations ¨C making everybody poorer, except the elites who profit from the fearmongering ¨C Trump has promised to make America competitive again.Trump is putting his money where his mouth is. According to a member of his transition team, the President-elect is looking at ways to withdraw as quickly as possible from a costly global climate agreement currently being ratified in Morocco. Since Trump¡¯s victory in Tuesday¡¯s election, governments ranging from China to small island states have reaffirmed their support for the agreement at climate talks running until November 18 in Marrakesh, Morocco. But Trump believes the global rules and regulations will continue to harm the American economy and the President-elect wants out. ¡°It was reckless for the Paris Agreement to enter into force before the election,¡± the source, who works on Trump¡¯s transition team, told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

From the National Review : ¡°A 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.¡± Other mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda ¨C even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being pushed by global warming proponents. And, of course, there are the more than 30,000 American scientists (to date) who agree with Trump and have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative ¨C and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. Breaking: Global Warming Data FAKED by Government Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth ¨C not human activity . Many more still are likely to sign the petition and speak out against the mainstream propaganda now that Trump has indicated a major change in U.S. policy.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/donald-trump-promised-to-bring-edward.html Edward Snowden is an American computer professional who previously worked as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA). Snowden made headlines around the world in 2013, after he copied and leaked classified information from the NSA, belonging to the United States government. His disclosures revealed how the American government had covertly spied on its citizens ¨C and the rest of the world ¨C in the name of so-called national security. These damning revelations exposed the American government, even among its allies. The Department of Justice later unsealed charges against Snowden, forcing him to seek asylum in Russia.Currently, Snowden is living at an undisclosed location in the vast country and has, so far, spent three years in exile. Since the disclosures, privacy activists in the West have pushed for more anti-spying laws. In the United States, for example, Congress has ordered the NSA to end its bulk phone metadata collection program authorized by a particular portion ¡ª Section 215 ¡ª of the Patriot Act. Under the new guidelines from Congress, the NSA may no longer directly collect and hold data about the domestic phone records of American citizens. In 2013, when Snowden made these revelations, the American public, and even people elsewhere in other countries, shared their opinion on the matter. Where some people, especially those in the Obama administration, believed Snowden should be crucified, privacy activists saw Snowden as a hero. At that time, Trump, of course, was preparing to run for the office of president of the United States. He also shared his opinion on the revelations made by Snowden, which had rocked the country to its core. The billionaire said then, that he would bring Snowden back to the United States with an apology, if only he was the president of the country. Below is Trump¡¯s Tweet on the matter on June 18, 2013. All I can say is that if I were President, Snowden would have already been returned to the U.S. (by their fastest jet) and with an apology! ¡ª Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2013 When Trump tweeted, many mocked him, saying that he would never become the president of the United States. However, now that he has just been elected, some people are holding him to his words, demanding that he immediately bring Snowden back, as he once said. In another tweet, published on April 19, 2016, Trump said Snowden deserves nothing but the death penalty for damaging the country¡¯s reputation with his revelations. Snowden also responded by saying he does not fear death, and that he has done nothing wrong, but only provided help to the people around the world. Before the elections, Trump was accused by Democrats ¨C and even some Republicans ¨C of having ties to the Russian government. Hillary Clinton alleged that the Kremlin, led by President Vladimir Putin, was trying to rig the election in favor of Trump. The concern here is that if it is true, that Trump indeed has links with the Russians, then he might possibly negotiate for the return of Snowden. Of course, Trump cannot order for the execution of Snowden, but he can certainly put him in jail. Snowden himself seems to have preferred Trump over Clinton, during the election. He tweeted before the election that the election was between Trump and Goldman Sachs, referring Goldman Sachs to Clinton. 2016: a choice between Donald Trump and Goldman Sachs. ¡ª Edward Snowden (@Snowden) February 28, 2016 For activists, Trump can turn things around by pardoning Snowden . Apart from Snowden, there are also calls for Trump to intervene and free Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange. WikiLeaks has said President Obama has a politically pivitol moment to pardon Manning and Snowden, and if not, he hands Trump a presidency with the freedom to take his prize. Assange and his WikiLeaks organization have come under heavy scrutiny from the Democratic Party for helping Trump to win the election. WikiLeaks published many hacked emails of the party, revealing corruption and malpractices in favor of Clinton getting the nomination of the party. This unhinged the unity of the party, and may have contributed to the voters¡¯ choice of the presidential candidates.

This is going to shock you. (Not). We reported yesterday on the telephone call between US president-elect Trump and Russian president Putin, where the current and future presidents discussed the need to set aside differences and look to more constructive future relations. With serious observers of this past year's increasing tensions between US and Russia openly worrying about a nuclear war breaking out, with some 300,000 NATO troops placed on Russia's border, with sanctions hurting average businesspersons on both sides, a normal person might look at the slight thaw in Cold War 2.0 as an early positive indicator of the end of the Obama Era.Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) begs to differ.In a blistering statement he released today responding to the Trump/Putin telephone call, Sen. McCain condemned any efforts by President-elect Trump to find common ground with Putin. Any claim by Putin that he wants to improve relations with the US must be vigorously opposed, writes McCain. He explains: ""We should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America¡¯s allies, and attempted to undermine America¡¯s elections."" Interesting that Republican McCain has taken to using the Hillary Clinton campaign line (the one that lost her the election) that somehow the Russians were manipulating the US electoral process. The claim was never backed up by facts and Hillary's claim that some 17 US intelligence agencies agreed with her was shown to be a dangerous and foolish lie.Why is Putin not to be trusted, according to McCain? ""Vladimir Putin has rejoined Bashar Assad in his barbaric war against the Syrian people with the resumption of large-scale Russian air and missile strikes in Idlib and Homs. Another brutal assault on the city of Aleppo could soon follow."" What McCain doesn't say is that unlike US troops in Syria, the Russians are invited by the Syrian government and operate according to international law . Oh yes, and they are also fighting al-Qaeda and ISIS , which has sought to overthrow Assad for the past five years. Maybe McCain is just really sensitive after meeting with al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria? As rumors swirl from Washington about neocons sniffing out top jobs in the incoming administration, it would serve president-elect Trump well to reflect on he true nature of the neocon beast...

Don¡¯t bother pointing out how incredibly dim-witted it is to pause a losing campaign just days away from Election Day to open up a luxury hotel to the Republican nominee, Trump doesn¡¯t want to hear it. 
After inexplicably spending a day participating in an opening ceremony for a new Trump Hotel in Washington DC, its namesake was in no mood to discuss his failing campaign. CNN¡¯s Dana Bash learned that the hard way when she asked the question on everyone¡¯s mind: What were you thinking? 
Rather than answer, Trump threw a hissy fit. 
¡°I say the following: You have been covering me for the last ¡ª long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I¡¯ve been doing this for weeks straight,¡± Trump said. 
¡°For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you¡¯ll ask me that question. I think that¡¯s a very rude question, to be honest with you.¡± Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising? Donald Trump: ¡°No, not at all¡± https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r 
¡ª CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 
For those keeping score that short answer checks a lot of boxes: Whining about the media Flagrant conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton¡¯s health Groundless accusation that asking a simple question is ¡°rude¡± No answer whatsoever 
Trump may be testy due to his slow realization that his campaign is under water, he has no practical way forward, and it would take a miracle to win. 
Instead of even trying, he seems to be retreating to the things he knows will make him money after the election. His campaign recently launched the prototype to ¡°Trump TV,¡± a daily live stream filled with confused campaign staffers, shameless opportunists and Rudy Giuliani. He also seems desperate to salvage his failing properties, something that may not be possible after running a campaign that offended practically every group in America. 
Already there are signs that Trump¡¯s hotels have taken a hit. Yahoo explains : Rates for rooms at Trump¡¯s new D.C. hotel are being slashed as travelers weigh their options, and smartphone data suggest fewer people are visiting his properties compared to rival venues nearby. The Republican nominee for president is in danger of losing not just the election, but something dear to a man who claims the marketing value of his name alone is worth $3 billion: the many customers, mostly wealthy, who have stayed at his hotels, played a round at his golf courses or held galas at his oceanside resorts. 
Trump may find that his bigotry has cost him not only the election, but the fortune he valued more than his reputation as well.

Utah. It is one of, if not the most conservative states in the nation, largely thanks to the Church of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints, aka the Mormons. And as such it is usually a solid, bright red state on the electoral maps. Utah has gone for the Democratic presidential candidate exactly once in the past 64 years ¡ª in the anti-Goldwater wave of 1964. But this year it is possible that Utah will not be in the Republican column when the votes are added up. That is, at least not in the Republican column headed by Donald Trump, who is largely being rejected by voters in the Beehive State. 
Many Utah voters with strong religious beliefs are not happy with Trump, and unlike many Christian evangelical leaders who have decided to stay hitched to his wagon despite the allegations of improper sexual conduct, Utahans are bolting, putting the state in play. The Young Turks sent Michael Shure to the state to find out what was on people¡¯s minds, and what many of them had to tell him was quite clear ¡ª they don¡¯t think Trump is a good representative of their Christian beliefs. 
None of the young Utahans Shure spoke to said they planned to vote for Trump. Some said they would vote for Gary Johnson. One college student indicated that he would consider a vote for Hillary. But the name that seemed to come up more than any others was Evan McMullin. 
McMullin is the Republican who is running an independent campaign for president. He is also a Mormon, which gives him a huge advantage in Utah. Some recent polls of the state have McMullin polling even with Clinton, but still trailing Trump. But as Benjamin Morris notes at FiveThirtyEight, there are questions about the methodology of those polls that could mean McMullin¡¯s support in Utah is even greater than he is getting credit for. 
Whether McMullin wins in Utah or whether Trump is able to squeak out a razor thin victory, one thing is certain: unlike many of their traditional ¡°Christian¡± counterparts in the deep south and the rest of the Rocky Mountain region, many Mormons want no part of Trump or his policies, which some of them were quite willing to tell Shure that they considered to be un-Christian. Not only will a loss of Utah further hurt Trump¡¯s slim chances of winning the White House, a McMullin win there would make him a footnote in future history books as the first third-party candidate since George Wallace in 1968 to win electoral votes.

Add another group to the list of people who won¡¯t be voting for Donald Trump. Oh, a few of them might but after they see this ad for Trump, I¡¯m betting the majority will laugh and vote for Hillary Clinton. 
Earlier in the month, Trump attended a Bollywood concert for charity. It was organized by the Republican Hindu Coalition, a group that was founded by a rich Indian-American named Shalli Kumar, who is looking to be the Hindu Sheldon Adelson. The Indian community is heavily Democratic so good luck with that. 
Trump came to the event, lit the Diya ¡ª it¡¯s doubtful that he had any idea what it was ¡ª and then spoke. He pandered told the attendees that ¡°the Indian and Hindu community will have a true friend in the White House,¡± promising they will ¡°defeat radical Islamic terrorism.¡± 
This inspired Kumar to make an ad which will be playing 20 times a day on Indian-American channels. He refused to say how much it cost the campaign to buy that much time but we can guess that Mr. Kumar is helping foot the bill. He previously has given almost $1 million to a fundraising committee which benefited both Trump and the RNC. 
There is a lot to laugh about in the ad, bt Trump¡¯s inability to pronounce Hindi words takes teh cake. It is such an obvious bit of pandering, even for him. 
The ad starts with a wish for a Happy Diwali , a holiday I am certain Trump is ignorant of. The cut to Trump¡¯s orange face is a bit jarring after the pretty lights and flowers. 
Kumar wanted to draw a similarity between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The PM¡¯s campaign had used a clever catchphrase which loosely translates to ¡°This time a Modi government.¡± Kumar wanted Trump to replace Modi¡¯s name with his own. In Hindi, that is ¡°Ab ki baar Trump sarkar.¡± Don¡¯t get ahead of me, now. 
In the ad, which uses footage of Trumps speech at the charity concert, a 2008 photo of the hotel which was attacked by Islamic militants in Mumbai gives way to a picture of PM Modi. Then back to Trump who tries to speak the short Hindi phrase. It¡¯s something one must see to believe. 
Make sure you aren¡¯t drinking anything as you may endanger your computer. 
¡°Approved by Donald Trump?¡± Well, I guess so. This ad is not just pandering, it is awful. I hope the Indian American community laugh this off and then go vote against this man who only shows interest in their culture when it might get him votes. 
Oh, and Happy Diwali! May the light burn away any bad times and welcome the good.

Thumb through the pages of the dictionary until you find the word ¡°craven¡± and a picture of Republican congressman Jason Chaffetz¡¯s picture will probably greet you. In a year full of pathetic spinelessness from Republicans, his efforts seem to stand out. 
It¡¯s hard to imagine a congressman doing more damage to his lasting reputation than Chaffetz pulled off on October 26th, 2016 ¨C a date that will live in infamy. First, news broke that Chaffetz was already prepping for a Clinton White House by pre-planning two years worth of senseless investigations in a shameless attempt to destroy any chance of her ¨C or congress ¨C accomplishing anything. And yet sadly that story was only half of the reason why Chaffetz singlehandedly proved Mark Twain wasn¡¯t kidding when he quipped ¡°Suppose you were an idiot and suppose you were a member of Congress, but then I repeat myself.¡± Congressman Chaffetz is a very big idiot. 
A little over one week after Chaffetz tried to score some cheap political points by unendorsing Donald Trump following the release of an audio tape in which the Republican nominee bragged about sexual assault, he sent out a tweet clarifying that when he said he wouldn¡¯t endorse or defend Trump, he never said he wouldn¡¯t vote for him. I will not defend or endorse @realDonaldTrump , but I am voting for him. HRC is that bad. HRC is bad for the USA. 
¡ª Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 27, 2016 
What¡¯s the distinction between ¡°endorsing¡± and ¡°voting for¡± you ask? Well, for Jason Chaffetz it¡¯s like when you want to bake a cake but you also want to eat it too. See? Simple. Chaffetz is a very, very big idiot. 
Making Chaffetz¡¯s cowardice all the more apparent is the reason why he said he was unendorsing Trump in the first place. Like the rest of the country, he heard Trump¡¯s boasts about grabbing women¡¯s genitals and found it abhorrent. He also said he couldn¡¯t face his 15-year-old daughter and support a potential sexual predator like Trump. 
¡°I can no longer in good conscience endorse this person for president. It is some of the most abhorrent and offensive comments that you can possibly imagine. My wife and I, we have a 15-year-old daughter, and if I can¡¯t look her in the eye and tell her these things, I can¡¯t endorse this person.¡± 
So to be perfectly clear, Jason Chaffetz, Republican congressman from Utah, can¡¯t look his daughter in the eye and endorse Donald Trump, but he can stare her straight in the face and say ¡°Dad just voted for this monster.¡± 
Nice work, Jason. You pathetic, small man. I¡¯m forwarding your congressional photo to Webster¡¯s.

On Wednesday night during a rally in Kinston, North Carolina, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump once again focused on his fabled ¡°minority outreach¡± initiative by kicking another black man out from his ¡°inclusive¡± rally. 
Trump accused the man of being a protester, however, like most of his supporters, Trump¡¯s perception of a person of color was way off base. 
During the exchange, Trump points to an older black man in a red shirt who made his way about 30 feet from the stage while yelling out ¡°Donald!¡± to get the nominee¡¯s attention. Trump immediately pounces on the opportunity to show how tough he is to his rabid supporters. 
¡°We have a protester!¡± he said . Trump then said this to Cary: ¡°By the way, were you paid $1,500 to be a thug?¡± 
As the man was escorted out by Trump¡¯s security team, the crowd erupted into chants of ¡°Trump! Trump! Trump,¡± as the candidate bellowed ¡°You can get him out. Get him out.¡± 
C.J. Cary is a 63-year old former Marine who has been a Trump supporter ever since the billionaire replied to a 1992 letter Cary sent during Trump¡¯s first divorce. 
Cary made his way to the rally on Wednesday to see his hero and deliver a personal message via note to the GOP candidate. The note contained a bit of advice for the nominee, basically telling him to stop saying offensive things about women, minorities, and people with disabilities on the campaign trail, otherwise ¡°lying Hillary¡± will beat him in November. 
However, the former Marine never had an opportunity to make it more than 30 feet from his favorite candidate before being stopped and unceremoniously thrown out of the venue by the candidate himself. 
Cary said he tried to explain his intentions to the security personnel. 
¡°I said, ¡®I was trying to get this doc to Mr. Donald ¡­ will you get this to Donald?¡¯ ¡± Cary told the paper. ¡°He said, ¡®Well dude, we¡¯d be happy to give it to him.¡¯ ¡± Trump calls black supporter a ""thug,"" has him kicked out of a rally in North Carolina. https://t.co/b4gkI6qx9v pic.twitter.com/eJKuu0CLRi 
¡ª Jason Sparks (@sparksjls) October 28, 2016 
But it seems that this incident hasn¡¯t deterred Cary¡¯s support for ¡°Mr. Donald¡± who he described as ¡°an honest person.¡± 
¡°I support Trump because he¡¯s honest,¡± Cary said . ¡°You can work with an honest person and convince them their vision isn¡¯t in the best interest of everyone. You can¡¯t work with dishonest people. That¡¯s why I don¡¯t like Obama¡ªthe worst president in American history.¡±

Over the past few months, the on-air battles at CNN between Trump¡¯s dumb-as-a-stump surrogate Katrina Pierson and liberal commentator Angela Rye have become legendary. On Friday morning the two put on the gloves to go another round. 
The conversation starts out innocently enough, with a discussion about new economic numbers that show the economy is growing and getting stronger.

Pierson responds that some members of the black community have been consulting with Trump about the problem. The look on Rye¡¯s face when she says that is classic. When she gets a chance to respond, she says, 
¡°I think it¡¯s really important that when we have conversations like this they¡¯re rooted in facts. Let¡¯s talk about what Donald Trump could be saying to black people that would resonate and be based in truth.¡± 
Rye goes on to explain how people like Trump, who have access to capital, don¡¯t seem to appreciate that everyone can¡¯t get their hands on money to improve their lives. Then she talks about Trump¡¯s history as a real estate mogul, who has actually contributed to the creation of the ¡°ghettos¡± which he now says he wants to fix. 
Pierson responds that Trump has worked with members of the black community, including Jesse Jackson, to help members of the black community create and build businesses. That promotes a hearty laugh from Rye. Costello notes that Rye was a former director of the Congressional Black Caucus, as she asks her to respond. Pierson cuts in, remarking ¡°And [she] ran it [the CBC] into the ground.¡± At that point, the two women drop all pretense of liking each other and the battle is on. Rye unloads on Pierson with a barrage of facts that her poor little Trump-addled brain was probably having difficulty processing. And when Costello tries to rein her in, Rye hits Pierson with a comment right out of Trump¡¯s playbook. Referring to the charge she ¡°ran the CBC into the ground,¡± Rye says: 
¡°That¡¯s slander. I could sue you, Katrina!¡±

Trump¡¯s campaign has been frantic to close the huge gap in donations between Clinton¡¯s and their own. By some estimates, Hillary is outspending Trump 7-to-1 in advertising ¨C a steep hill to climb for a campaign that is already losing badly in nearly every battleground state. 
But in his desperation, Trump did something incredibly stupid. He promised his fans that he would ¡°triple match¡± any donation over $75 that they made on October 1st. 
His fans, believing Trump would put his money where his mouth is, gave generously. Instead of make good on the promise, Trump donated squat. In fact, his donations for the entire month were less than he should have donated that very first day. On Oct 1, I got an email from Trump pledging to triple donations for 24 hrs. 
Donors gave $165,829 that day. 
Trump gave $30,682 all month.

Even for Trump¡¯s diehard fans, this looks like the man is just the kind of grifter his critics have always claimed he was. Despite pretending to ¡°self-fund¡± his campaign, Trump has chipped in hardly anything. He¡¯s run his campaign much like he ran his charity, using other people¡¯s money to promote himself. 
This is in stark contrast to Trump¡¯s boasts. Famously, the candidate once said he was willing to spend upwards of one billion dollars on his campaign to be president. With just 11 days to go, Trump hasn¡¯t even come close. Most estimates put his own contribution around $50 million ¨C chump change for an alleged billionaire.

And it seems Trump¡¯s campaign knows how badly he screwed this up. His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway scrambled to the nearest media outlet to proclaim that Trump would absolutely be fulfilling a promise he made to donate $100 million by the election. (Note again: He has just 11 days left to do so.) 
And then Trump himself reportedly wired $10 million to his campaign on Friday morning in a day late, dollar short desperation maneuver to help pull out of this tailspin. Donald Trump wired $10M of his own money into this presidential campaign this morning ¨C Dow Jones

It¡¯s hard to truly be surprised that Trump has been stingy with his own campaign. This is the ¡°billionaire¡± who managed to pay no taxes in twenty years and donate almost no money to charity in the same period. He makes Scrooge McDuck look generous. And with less than two weeks to go, Trump¡¯s chances of becoming president are looking about as fictional as the cartoon duck. 
Go home, Donald.

The list of women sexually assaulted by Donald J. Trump just keeps growing ¡ª and a new cringe-inducing video from a 2011 corporate speech adds yet another . In the video, Trump not only sexually assaults, but humiliates, the 2004 Miss Universe winner on stage, in front of thousands. ¡°She¡¯s not very bright¡± 
Both candidates have had cringe-inducing moments this election cycle, but by-the-by, Clinton¡¯s have been significantly less than Trump¡¯s have and Trump¡¯s have come in rapid succession of horrible moments; a parade of everything wrong with the masculine idea in the United States. A new video posted by the Huffington Post on Saturday added yet another horrible moment to the raft of them ¡ª a raft that, in any decent society, would have already sunk. 
A few weeks ago, a tape of Donald Trump emerged into the popular conscious. The tape contained two things: Trump admitting that he sexually assaulted women and Trump using the word ¡°pussy.¡± No points for guessing which one pissed off more of his evangelical supporters. Since then, a huge number of women have come forward and leveled accusations of sexual assault at Donald Trump. 
Make no mistake, Trump is having his Bill Cosby moment right now. 
Among the list of accusations against Trump include claims that Trump told a group of 10-year-olds that he¡¯d date them in 10 years, a telling a group of 14-year-olds he¡¯d date them in a few years, groping women, sexually assaulting women, and we can¡¯t forget that he¡¯s been accused of raping a 13-year-old at a party hosted by infamous American financier and level three sex offender Jeffery Epstein (who served three months of an 18 month prison sentence for soliciting sex from an underage prostitute, because we don¡¯t have a two-tier justice system at all in the United States). 
Thus, this new footage that shows Trump forcing 2004 Miss Universe winner Jennifer Hawkins into a nonconsensual kiss and then humiliating her on stage isn¡¯t an aberration. It¡¯s a continuation of the skeevy behavior that a huge number of men are not only okay with, not only think is normal, but believe is something that¡¯s worth preserving and perpetuating instead of stamping out like an intellectual scabies infection. 
The video shows Trump calling Hawkins on stage to join him after telling the audience his philosophy of using revenge to succeed in business: ¡°Get even with people,¡± he said. ¡°If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that.¡± 
There are a few quotes from the Bible that are relevant here, but I¡¯m pretty sure that Biblical literalists and right-wing evangelicals don¡¯t know what those quotes are. They¡¯re too busy agreeing with Trump. 
Trump was apparently mad at Hawkins the day before because he thought she¡¯d slighted him by declining to introduce him at an event in Sydney ¡ª Hawkins, it should be noted, is Australian. Once she was onstage with Trump, Hawkings laughed apologetically and said it was a ¡°miscommunication with my management,¡± which left her, ¡°[feeling] really bad.¡± 
Trump seemed to accept this, saying: ¡°When she found out, she got in her car and she got her ass over here, and I love her.¡± 
Spray-tan Hitler has a well-known vindictive streak. He at least entertained the possibility of forming a PAC to sink the political careers of Ted Cruz ¡ª voted second most punchable face in the world after Trump superfan and Breitbart personality Milo Yiannopoulos ¡ª and John Kasich after the two of them refused to show up at the Republican national convention and kiss his ring. He¡¯s threatened to use his power as president to arrest people he disagrees with. To say he¡¯s vindictive may well be a British-level understatement (and if he¡¯s elected, it¡¯ll definitely be a British-level mistake). 
That vindictive streak is probably what led to the sequence of bizarre events that followed, culminating ultimately with Trump forcing a nonconsensual kiss on Hawkins. 
First, he described how he would have embarrassed Hawkin if she¡¯d really slighted him: ¡°I was actually going to get up and tell you that Jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but she¡¯s not very bright. That wouldn¡¯t have been true, but I would have said it anyway.¡± 
Trump then made a sexual pun, and of course lingered on it until the audience got it or laughed out of awkwardness, I can¡¯t be sure which: ¡°And you know what? She came tonight, she came ¡ª came, she came, she came.¡± Once the audience laughed, Trump added: ¡°See, so they have the same filthy minds in Australia.¡± 
Then he grabbed her around the waist and forced a kiss on her. This is pretty much on par with what others have accused Trump of doing ¡ª according to Cathy Heller, who claims that Trump assaulted her at a Mother¡¯s Day brunch at Mar-a-Lago : ¡°He took my hand, and grabbed me, and went for the lips,¡± she claimed. Alarmed, she said she leaned backwards to avoid him and almost lost her balance. ¡°And he said, ¡®Oh, come on.¡¯ He was strong. And he grabbed me and went for my mouth and went for my lips.¡± She turned her head, she claims, and Trump planted a kiss on the side of her mouth. ¡°He kept me there for a little too long,¡± Heller said. ¡°And then he just walked away.¡± 
If you feel like you need a shower after this, just remember: you probably have a relative who thinks voting for this man is a good idea.

Voter fraud has been on the minds of Republicans for a while now. It has been proven that while yes, there are isolated incidences of in-person voter fraud, there has never been a case where it was so rampant that it changed the results of an election. But that¡¯s exactly what the GOP wants you to think is going on. 
Donald Trump took Republican rhetoric about voter fraud and has ramped it up to an entirely new level, claiming that the upcoming election is going to be ¡°rigged.¡± Apparently, Republicans are in on this alleged rigging along with Democrats, since a number of the states where the vote looks to be close are controlled by the GOP. And as everyone outside of Trump¡¯s basket of deplorables knows, election mechanics are handled by the states, not the federal government. 
How are Trump¡¯s supporters reacting to all of his claims about voter fraud? Well, in at least one case the answer to that question is ¡°By committing voter fraud themselves.¡± 
Terri Lynn Rote, 55, an Iowa Trump supporter, has been charged with ¡°election misconduct,¡± which is a Class D felony in the state. According to Iowa Public Radio, Rote allegedly voted for Trump twice when she cast her ballot during early voting. And her reason? She was afraid that her first vote would be changed to a vote for Hillary Clinton, so she voted again. The Des Moines Register reports that Rote voted once at the Polk County elections office , then again at a county satellite polling location. 
Rote told Iowa Public Radio, 
¡°I wasn¡¯t planning on doing it twice, it was spur of the moment. The polls are rigged.¡± 
According to the Register, Rote¡¯s case was one of three voter fraud cases that occurred in Polk County alone. The other two incidents involved people who voted on mail-in ballots, then voted again in person. Polk County auditor Jamie Fitzgerald says this is the first time in his 12 years in office he has had to deal with even one case of voter fraud, let alone three. There are no details about who the other two suspects cast ballots for. The sad thing is, polls have been saying for weeks that Trump is going to win Iowa. Cases like this might put his win there in question, which would be a perfect example of poetic justice. 
This is what the rhetoric about voter fraud has come t0 ¡ª people attempting to vote multiple times because they¡¯re convinced that their chosen candidate is going to be cheated out of a legitimate win. Republicans, unwilling to accept that their policies are being rejected by a larger and larger segment of the U.S. population, are trying to sell the message that elections are being stolen from the GOP by ¡°massive¡± voter fraud. Yet, time after time, it seems to be Republicans who are committing the lion¡¯s share of it. They claim to love the country, but Trump and the GOP are deliberately undermining the foundation of a democracy ¡ª the integrity of the vote. Next, Trump will claim that people like Terri Rote are ¡°political prisoners.¡± Just wait for it.

On Friday night¡¯s episode of Real Time With Bill Maher , CNN¡¯s Van Jones sat down with Maher, one on one, and addressed the issue of Donald Trump¡¯s dangerous, racist rhetoric and said that if Trump were black, people would be hearing his words in a completely different way. 
¡°If Trump were black, we¡¯d be calling him a thug!¡±

Let¡¯s face it ¡ª President Obama wouldn¡¯t have gotten anywhere near the White House if he did the things that Trump has been caught doing, and would likely be under indictment (or possibly in prison) for sexual assault.

The Republicans¡¯ fear of voter fraud may yet come true ¡ª mostly because it looks like the Republicans are going to be the ones instigating it, thanks to Donald Trump, who basically told his followers on Sunday to go out and steal the election. ¡°Four or five times¡± 
There¡¯s been a lot of digital ink spilled this election on the delusional claims of voter fraud, but what I think is interesting is that this highlights just how ready the right-wing is to divorce itself from the electoral process entirely . They¡¯ve lost the popular vote five of the last six elections, and if things go the way they¡¯re going and American liberals get out to vote, it¡¯s going to be six of the last seven on the morning of November 9. 
Trump and the Republican Party would like their followers to believe that this isn¡¯t because their ideology is painfully out of step with the country in modern times. Instead, Trump claims the election will be stolen from him ¨C whether by ¡°Mexicans,¡± or the media, or a ¡°cabal of international bankers.¡± 
But see, here¡¯s the thing: there is a self-proclaimed billionaire who¡¯s working to undermine the election, and it¡¯s not Carlos Slim ¡ª it¡¯s Donald J. Trump and his paranoid loony bin followers, which include a disturbing number of white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazis, and John Birch dropouts. 
While speaking to a crowd at a rally in Greeley, Colorado late Sunday, Trump once again cast doubts on the mail-in ballots , encouraging people to get another ballot and mail that one in , too. Over and over: 
¡°Who has sent their ballots in? And do you think those ballots are properly counted?¡± Trump asked the audience, to which they replied ¡°No!¡± 
Trump continued by expressing his skepticism and telling supporters to go get new ballots to ensure their vote is counted. 
¡° If you go to university center, they¡¯ll give you a new ballot, they¡¯ll void your old ballot, in some places they do that four or five times, so by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in. ¡± 
CNN said the comment was ¡°stoking skepticism¡± because they don¡¯t have the wherewithal to call this what it really is: encouraging voter fraud. 
¡°Liberal media¡± my ass. 
And it appears to be having an effect. Some of Trump¡¯s followers have already taken this message to heart, and at least one has already been arrested for it . 
Between these clowns and the clowns that are going to ¡°make sure there isn¡¯t any illegal voting at the booths¡±¡ª i.e, instigate voter intimidation against Hispanics, Arabs, African-Americans and anyone else who doesn¡¯t look like a white Trump supporter ¡ª one gets the feeling that election night is going to be a chaotic one.

The decision of FBI Director Comey to go public with a supposed ¡®bombshell¡¯ investigation into new Hillary emails was welcomed by Trump as the mainstream media recklessly reported on this total dud of a controversy. It basically dominated the news cycle all day and probably will until we all cast out our vote next Tuesday (or November 28th if you support Trump.) 
But the politically motivated and reckless actions of Comey have many outraged, including Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid 
Senator Reid appeared with Clinton today to push back against the ¡°inappropriate,¡± ¡°unprecedented,¡± and ¡°puzzling¡± move by FBI Director James Comey to suddenly go public with new emails. Roughly two months removed from retirement, Reid is waging an all-out war on Comey as he claims a ¡°disturbing double standard¡± took place in the FBI¡¯s decision to publish this misleading announcement while essentially ignoring Trump. 
Reid pointed specifically to information the FBI allegedly has that ties Trump to Russia ¨C information Reid says they have intentionally sat on in order to not hurt the candidate¡¯s chances of being elected. 
He expressed his ire in a blistering letter to Comey. Here¡¯s a key passage: 
Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. 
And it¡¯s not as though one can accuse Reid of being blindly partisan since he previously defended Comey when Republicans tried to filibuster his nomination and subsequently delay his confirmation. Reid wrote: 
¡°I believed you to be a principled public servant.¡± 
The actions of Comey were indeed politically motivated as he desperately wished to be loved again by law & order conservatives. But Reid just opened up a whole new can of worms.

Trump¡¯s chances of winning Tuesday¡¯s election are pretty close to zero. Nearly everyone both inside and outside his campaign understands that, except him. Trump is a type A personality taken to extremes and he cannot accept failure. When faced with an actual loss (and in this case a humiliating national one), his mind creates a counter narrative that he can accept. Things are rigged. The race was stolen. Everyone is against him. 
I¡¯m not just saying this because he looks crazy on TV. Plenty of people have come forward with some pretty horrific tales of what happens when Trump feels like he¡¯s lost something. Even the littlest loss will set him into a tale spin of self-deception. Take Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter , who made an off-hand comment in Spy Magazine about Trump¡¯s small hands. For the last 30 years he¡¯s been receiving odd notes: 
To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump. There is always a photo of him¡ªgenerally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers. I almost feel sorry for the poor fellow because, to me, the fingers still look abnormally stubby. 
Then there¡¯s Selina Scott who also claims to have received weird little love notes from Trump calling her ¡°sleazy¡± and suggesting she¡¯s not a very good journalist. This after Trump tried and failed to seduce her. 
Trump also tried a similar tact with Selma Hayek; first he asked her out and then once she refused, he attacked. She says that he leaked a story to the National Enquirer that he turned her down because she was too short. (Later, he attempted to turn that smear into a positive by suggesting she go out with him to prove the story wrong. Classy.) 
That¡¯s exactly what seems to be going on inside the Trump campaign right now. There¡¯s a lot of anger and a lot of bizarre story-telling an anonymous Trump staffer told New York Magazine . He compares the atmosphere to what being in the bunker with Hitler must have been like just before he killed himself. People are all smiling at meetings and then returning to their offices to desperately search for work elsewhere. Kellyanne Conway, Trump¡¯s newest campaign manager, is increasingly upset with him over his lack of strategy. Supposedly, before Paul Manafort left the Trump campaign he suggested that they try to keep Trump completely out of the public eye: 
The best thing we can do is to have you move into a cave for the next four months. If you¡¯re not on the campaign trail, the focus is on her, and we win. 
In just over a week, Trump will have another loss to rationalize away. It¡¯s likely to get pretty ugly and someone no doubt will receive some creepy news clippings in the mail. But just remember that not long ago this guy was actually neck and neck with Hillary Clinton. This bizarre sex-crazed business baby could have actually wound up being our next president. So congratulations America; but also, get your shit together.

His claims of voter fraud are little more than whining, but that doesn¡¯t stop people from believing claims like the one he made at a Colorado rally on Saturday, where he said election officials would throw away mail-in ballots if they don¡¯t ¡°like¡± them. ¡°Real Problem¡± 
However, it¡¯s worth analyzing his previous claims all the same. Trump claimed that an International Cabal of Bankers is conspiring with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim to ¡°rig¡± the American election and bring a permanent end to the United States . If this sounds completely insane to you, that¡¯s because it is. 
However, it¡¯s worth noting the things that the average American is going to miss in that statement. 
For instance, ¡°international cabal of bankers¡± is pretty transparent talk for ¡°Jews.¡± One of the major conspiracy theories of these Antisemitic loons is the International Jewish banker conspiracy ¡ª it¡¯s so important that it has its own fiction novel devoted to it (it was one of Henry Ford¡¯s favorite books): Protocols of the Elders of Zion . In fact, when I typed ¡°cabal of international bankers¡± in Google, it helpfully suggested ¡°elders of zion¡± as a related search. Given his voter base consists of white nationalists, the KKK, neo-Nazis, and racists in general, it shouldn¡¯t surprise you to learn he might as well be quoting from the seminal work of Antisemitism. 
And if you think I¡¯m reading too much into this, let me remind you that his foreign policy advisor allegedly said that the Nazi ovens were ¡°too small¡± to kill six million Jewish people . His alt-right supporters have savaged Jewish reporter simply for being Jewish . Antisemitism swirls around the man. 
Trump¡¯s latest made up accusations aren¡¯t couched in the same extremely transparent and Antisemitic rhetoric that his usual accusations are. Instead, they¡¯re the sort of straightforward nonsense that we¡¯ve come to expect from Agent Orange when he attempts to speak a mind he doesn¡¯t have. 
While speaking before a Colorado rally on Saturday, Trump told the audience that election officials are going to ¡°throw out¡± mail-in ballots they disagree with, saying: 
¡°I have real problems with ballots being sent. People say, oh, here¡¯s a ballot, bing. Here¡¯s another ballot, throw it away. Oh, here¡¯s one I like, we¡¯ll keep that one.¡± Trump talks voter fraud in Colorado; says he has a ""real problem"" with mail in ballots. (h/t @ergold ) pic.twitter.com/FS0LUOhIVc 
¡ª Ali Vitali (@alivitali) October 29, 2016 
Trump seems to think that there are going to be a ¡°lot of people watching¡± to make sure that the ballots are correct, which is utterly delusional at best and disastrous at worst. These walking poster children for Dunning-Kruger have no idea what they¡¯re doing; they¡¯re armed, emotionally charged, racist, clueless, and out to protect ¡°their country¡±¡ª which doesn¡¯t include people like me. 
Perhaps they should all wear brown shirts, too. That way, police know who to remove once they¡¯ve cast their vote. 
¡°We¡¯re trying to have some pretty good supervision out there,¡± he warned. 
Sure you are. If by ¡°supervision¡± you mean people carrying out voter intimidation. Because that¡¯s exactly what¡¯ll happen.

On Sunday, during an appearance on Fox and Friends , Trump surrogate Brunell Donald-Kyei went into full-blown Mad Hatter mode as she ¡°argued¡± the significance of the FBI¡¯s recent announcement concerning Hillary Clinton¡¯s emails. 
During the segment, after proclaiming that she¡¯s an ¡°attorney,¡± the Vice-Chair of Trump¡¯s National Diversity Coalition declared that the FBI doesn¡¯t just ¡°reopen cases.¡± However, panelist Brian Benjamin observed that the FBI had not officially reopened the case against Clinton (most likely due to the fact that they have not actually found anything). 
This unauthorized use of logic on the Fox News channel prompted Donald-Kyei to quickly dive down a rabbit hole of far-right-wing conspiracy theories, first citing the Wikileaks Podesta emails as proof of Clinton¡¯s corruption and then implying something much darker about the presidential candidate. 
¡°We¡¯ve got Huma Abedin with 10,000 emails under ¡°life insurance¡± because she doesn¡¯t want an accidental death,¡± declared the Trump surrogate. 
Um. What? 
She then went on to rail against Clinton and Obama, accusing both of making race relations worse over the past eight years. 
¡°Hillary Clinton is running around saying [that], when she and the president have worked so hard over the last eight years to divide the country.¡± 
Without citing any concrete evidence, the attorney claimed that both Clinton and Obama worked to pit ¡°whites against blacks, blacks against Hispanics,¡± and ¡°Hispanics against Asians.¡± 
She further argued that unlike Obama and Clinton, Trump would bring Americans together. 
Donald-Kyei concluded her rant with a prediction as bulletproof as her logic. 
¡°Believe me, believe me, they are convening a grand jury,¡± Donald-Kyei exclaimed . ¡°Trust me!¡± 
Donald Trump must have the greatest collection of mentally unbalanced, intellectually dishonest, and morally dubious surrogates of any presidential candidate in U.S. history.

On November 9, 2016, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump could become the first president-elect to be named as a defendant in a child rape case. 
A woman named Katie Johnson filed a 100 million dollar federal lawsuit against Trump in a New York federal court this summer. 
Johnson filed a similar federal lawsuit in California on May 2, but her case was thrown out due to a clerical error. 
The alleged victim later refiled her case in a New York federal court. 
Johnson accuses Trump along with his long time friend Jeff Epstein, who¡¯s also a billionaire financier and convicted sex offender, of raping a woman when she was only 13-years-old in 1994. 
In a court affidavit, the alleged victim, who is identified in court documents as ¡°Jane Doe,¡± said that Trump hit her and raped her while she was tied to a bed in Epstein¡¯s posh upper east side New York apartment. 
Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from an underage girl. He served 13 months of an 18-year prison term before being released. 
In the affidavit, Johnson also mentions that Trump threatened her life. 
The alleged victim¡¯s accounts are corroborated by two witnesses (identified in court records as ¡°Joan Doe¡± and ¡°Tiffany Doe¡±), who allegedly worked as ¡°party planners¡± for Epstein. 
¡°I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop,¡± Tiffany Doe alleges . 
Tiffany Doe also claimed to have witnessed Trump force Jane Doe and an unidentified 12-year-old girl (identified in court records as Maria) to perform oral sex on him, then continue to physically abuse the girls after the act concluded. 
In court documents, Tiffany Doe said that part of her job was to ¡°personally witness and supervise encounters between the underage girls that Mr. Epstein hired and his guests.¡± 
According to the former ¡°party planner,¡± both Trump and Epstein threatened Jane Doe if she ever revealed what they had done. They used Maria¡¯s disappearance as collateral that they would make good on their threat, implying that they had the girl murdered. 
¡°I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldn¡¯t ever say anything if she didn¡¯t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed,¡± Tiffany Doe alleged. 
When Tiffany Doe stopped working for Epstein in 2002, she said the billionaire threatened to kill her and her family if she ever came forward about his activities. 
¡°I fully understand that that the life of myself and my family is now in grave danger,¡± she said. 
A federal judge has ordered a hearing concerning Johnson¡¯s case to be held on December 16.

Outgoing Senator Harry Reid took a lot of flack for speaking out about the double standard that exists between how the FBI treats Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Many, even on the left, slammed Reid as a conspiracy nut for suggesting the FBI was sitting on information explicitly linking Russia and Trump. Left-leaning New Republic was particularly brutal: Republicans are right: Hary Reid should be ashamed of himself . 
Instead, he¡¯s been vindicated. 
Just one day after making the remarks, several explosive stories dropped coming from entirely separate journalists that document several ways in which Trump is tied to Russia ¨C and the FBI knows about it. 
According to a report by NBC News, the FBI is making ¡°preliminary inquiry¡± into Trump¡¯s former campaign manager Paul Manafort for his ties to Russian businesses. Trump himself is rumored to have business interests linked to Russia ¨C but has thus far refused calls to release his tax returns to disprove it. Even more critically, Mother Jones spoke to an unnamed counterintelligence officer who said that the FBI has more information than they are letting on. 
¡­a former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence tells Mother Jones that in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump¡ªand that the FBI requested more information from him. 
According to the informant, the ¡°Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.¡± This aligns with what many intelligence experts in the U.S. have suspected, as well. Putin doesn¡¯t want Trump because he thinks he can work with him, he wants Trump because his presidency would tear American democracy apart at the seams. In the power vacuum that would ensue, Russia would then hope to capitalize on it geopolitically. Not a bad plan considering Trump has repeatedly demonstrated he is a moron when it comes to foreign policy. 
Unlike Clinton, however. The FBI has clearly taken pains to keep this investigation out of the public eye. In a sardonic twist, they even cite privacy as the reason why they can¡¯t comment, leading Democratic congressman Adam Schiff to note : 
¡°Any specifics of what the FBI or intelligence agencies may be looking at are not something that the bureau should be discussing publicly,¡± Schiff said. ¡°But here, where the director has discussed an investigation involving one candidate, it opens the director up to claims of bias if he doesn¡¯t discuss other potential investigations.¡± 
Meanwhile, Trump appears content to flaunt his love affair with Russia. On the very same day that Reid unloaded on him, the Republican candidate told a rally that he planned to work closely with Putin. Trump: ""Wouldn¡¯t it be nice? Wouldn¡¯t it be smart?"" To ¡°put everything together with Putin"" and Russia?

Police say they have caught the man they believe shot two Iowa police officers dead in what is being described as an ¡°ambush-style¡± attack. 
The man behind the shooting is reportedly Scott Michael Greene, a 46-year-old Urbandale resident with a history of run-ins with the law, Confederate flag fetishism, and anger towards African Americans. He also has a recent obsession with Donald Trump. 
In a video allegedly posted by Greene and discovered by Buzzfeed , the soon-to-be cop killer records himself having an altercation with police officers on October 14. In a comment below the video, he says: 
¡°I was offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem. Thousands more whites fought and died for their freedom. However this is not about the Armed forces, they are cop haters.¡± 
Ironically, the video mostly featured Greene yelling at various cops about his rights while they try to escort him from a high school property. A selfie taken at the game shows why witnesses found Greene to be disturbing the peace. Greene decided to bring his Confederate flag to the stands with him. 
Naturally, Greene¡¯s neighbors say he came out hard for Trump several weeks ago, even placing a large Trump/Pence 2016 sign in his yard. Neighbor tells me that shooting suspect Scott Michael Greene put this Trump sign in his yard approx 2 weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/8HjtthB51I

Not exactly a surprising development considering the Republican candidates uncanny ability to collect endorsements from neo-Nazis, KKK leaders, and other hate groups. Also not surprising: The typically loud-mouthed Trump has been dead silent about the fact that his own supporter is allegedly involved in the execution of two police officers. Ditto for many of the same Republicans who rushed to baselessly blame Hillary Clinton and President Obama of inciting violence against cops every time they can. 
Iowa¡¯s own Rep. Steve King (R) had this inflammatory remark to say just after the Dallas police shooting: #DallasPoliceShooting has roots in first of anti-white/cop events illuminated by Obama¡­Officer Crowley. There were others.

In August of 2015, while trying desperately to convince Evangelical Christians that he would be a better choice for president than the laundry list of other potential Republican candidates, Donald Trump made the outrageous claim that his favorite book was the Bible . He even placed his own book just behind it. ¡°[The Art of the Deal] is my second favorite book of all time,¡± said Trump. ¡°Do you know what my first is? The Bible! Nothing beats the Bible,¡± he added to applause. 
The feigned adoration for the Christian holy book was undone by the fact that Trump had quite literally never shown an interest in religion prior to that moment, couldn¡¯t name a single New Testament passage when pressed, and years earlier once remarked that he didn¡¯t believe adultery ¨C one of the Ten Commandments ¨C was a sin. 
Now that Trump is the nominee and Christian conservatives have stood by him despite his disgusting hate campaign and torrent of sexual assault allegations, he¡¯s apparently feeling a bit more confident. He doesn¡¯t need to fake it anymore. It was fun while it lasted! 
When asked by Extra ¡®s A.J. Calloway what his favorite books were, Trump seemingly forgot that ¡°nothing beats the Bible.¡± He put his own books back on top. When given a ¡°rapid fire¡± quiz about his two favorite books, without hesitation Trump went with ¡°The Art of the Deal¡± and ¡°Surviving at the Top,¡± both of which were written by ghostwriters but with Trump getting a byline. 
It¡¯s particularly interesting that Trump with ¡°The Art of the Deal,¡± considering the man responsible for writing it has since disavowed Trump and now acts as his biggest critic . 
¡°I put lipstick on a pig,¡± he said. ¡°I feel a deep sense of remorse that I contributed to presenting Trump in a way that brought him wider attention and made him more appealing than he is.¡± He went on, ¡°I genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.¡± 
As with every answer Trump gives off-the-cuff, this one is very revealing. Here is a man so caught up in worshiping himself that when asked what his favorite book is he can only think of the ones with his own name on the covers. It really does say everything about his personality.

However, Stewart hasn¡¯t completely stayed out of election talk; after all, he appeared on The Late Show with his friend and partner in crime Stephen Colbert. On Tuesday night, Stewart left us with another comedic treat ¨C and of course the target of his relentless mockery was GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. 
At the ¡°Stand Up for Heroes Benefit¡± in New York City¡¯s Madison Square Garden, Stewart wasted no time in lighting into Trump. He began: 
¡°I¡¯m not as much of a political analyst. But if I could ask you a question that I¡¯ve been saying to my television, it¡¯s ¡®What the fuck? What the fuck is going on? What is happening?!'¡± 
Stewart then went on to recall a Twitter war Trump started with him, complete with Trumpian anti-Semitic dog whistles, in which Trump called Stewart ¡°Jonathan Leibowitz¡± and said that he needs to be ¡°proud of his heritage.¡± Of course, Stewart trolled Trump harder than Trump could ever troll him, saying: 
¡°So I start to think to myself, Oh, I think this guy is trying to let people know I¡¯m a Jew. And I think to myself, doesn¡¯t my face do that? Honestly, like, where have you seen this face other than a poster for Yentl ?

So I decide to tweet back at him, ¡°Many people don¡¯t know this, but Donald Trump¡¯s real name is Fuckface Von Clownstick. I wish you would embrace the Von Clownstick heritage.¡±

Speaking to the crowd at a campaign rally in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, Melania expanded on her plan to fight online bullying as First Lady. 
¡°I will be an advocate for women and for children,¡± she said. ¡°Children and teenagers can be fragile. They are hurt when they are made fun of or made to feel less in looks or intelligence.¡±

The stakes were very high for Melania Trump¡¯s big campaign speech, the only one she¡¯s given since being very publicly mocked for stealing her best lines from the RNC from none other than First Lady Michelle Obama. Unfortunately for the Trump campaign, the pressure must have gotten to her. 
She plagiarized again. 
It took less than an hour for people to figure it out, but the source will have people scratching their heads for days. Melania, Trump¡¯s third wife, seems to have lifted portions of her speech from Marla Maples, Trump¡¯s second wife. 
While speaking about her experiences as an immigrant, Melania said ¡°America meant if you could dream it, you could become it.¡± 
Tablet Magazine writer Yair Rosenberg, simply put the line into Google and saw what came up. It was a direct quote from Marla Maples given to a magazine in the 90s. Melania just plagiarized Trump's second wife Marla Maples. Here's the only Google results for ""if you could dream it, you could become it"": pic.twitter.com/ALeHuSZqEm 
¡ª (((Yair Rosenberg))) (@Yair_Rosenberg) November 3, 2016 
Is ¡°If you could dream it, you could become it¡± a cliche? Sure. Is it weird that Melania would say the exact same phrase that Marla had? Definitely. 
However, more damning is what else Rosenberg noticed. It's not just the one cliched line, it's that the entire section about parents/opportunities is a ripoff, just like it was by Michelle Obama https://t.co/IK15IXH7As 
¡ª (((Yair Rosenberg))) (@Yair_Rosenberg) November 3, 2016 
It¡¯s as if Melania typed what she wanted to say into Google, found the interview by Marla Maples, and simply made it her speech . 
Educator and speechwriter Yoni Brander pointed out that the odd butchering of the truism ¡°If you can dream it, you can be it¡± suggests Melania really did lift the section directly from Marla ¨C the only other person on record as having screwed it up that way. 3. can dream it, you can become it."" by William A. Ward. But the form used byMelania which cuts the beginning of the quote and changes 
¡ª yoni brander (@yonibrander) November 3, 2016 4. changes the tense to ""if you dream it, you could become it¡± a variant that appears in only in one other place- Marla Maples interview 
¡ª yoni brander (@yonibrander) November 3, 2016 
It is also in line with how Melania says she screwed up her RNC speech. She told reporters at the time that she accidentally plagiarized by harmlessly finding passages from other people that spoke to her and using them as her starting point. One of those passages, Michelle Obama¡¯s speech, made its way into the final draft. In the same way, it appears Melania plagiarized her husband¡¯s ex-wife. 
To which one must conclude that Trump¡¯s camp is run by an staggering assortment of incompetent buffoons. To screw up one major speech is a goof, to screw up two in a row¡­ that¡¯s a level of idiocy that is difficult to wrap one¡¯s head around. And while Melania needs to stop using Google to write her speeches, Trump¡¯s campaign needs to spend five minutes making sure she doesn¡¯t steal lines from the candidate¡¯s ex-wife. It¡¯s not rocket science.

Just one week before America decides whether or not to elect Donald Trump, one of his supporters decided to help get his message out by torching a black church and defacing its wall with the words ¡°Vote Trump.¡± 
¡°When firefighters arrived at Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church Tuesday night, they found it in flames, and the Vote Trump slogan written in silver spray paint on the outside wall of the church,¡± Mark Rigsby of Mississippi Public Broadcasting reports. 
¡°Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons calls this a hate crime ¡ª an attempt to frighten voters just days before the presidential election.¡± 
Trump has yet to condemn the attack, or even mention it. 
Mississippi has been the host of many decades of violence directed at African Americans. During the Jim Crow era, acts of terror committed against black Mississippians was disturbingly common. It seems for at least one Trump supporter, the term ¡°Make American Great Again¡± means returning to that dark time. 
But rather than let this disgusting display of intolerance be the story, Americans got to work. In just hours, a verified GoFundMe account was set up by concerned citizens and thousands of dollars began to pour in to help rebuild. 
It¡¯s goal was to raise $10,000. It likely wouldn¡¯t be enough to repair all of the damages inside and outside of the church, but it would be a start. Instead, people gave over $150,000. And perhaps even more remarkably, the entire world appeared ready to reject the deplorable racism and bigotry that led to this act. The campaign¡¯s organizer updated the campaign by saying that people from all faiths (and none at all) and many countries have contributed: 
Responses have been pouring in from all over the world, and they¡¯re truly extraordinary. Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, atheists and many more, from all over the United States and many other countries. 
And according to GoFundMe¡¯s VP of Communications and Policy Dan Pfeiffer, this campaign is perhaps the fastest growing in the history of the site. This one right here is verified and one of our fastest growing history https://t.co/E4smWW2s7d https://t.co/xIQWY4ulsV

Donald Trump¡¯s merry band of supporters are surely not known for being the brightest crayons in the box. If anything, they tend to be a dull gray. The GOP nominee himself has even bragged about his loyal following of ¡°poorly educated¡± dumbasses from across the country. His most fervent backers tend to have shoe sizes with larger numbers than their IQs. 
However, what Trump¡¯s followers are known for is their tendency to plan for retaliation if Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election on Tuesday. They have promised a civil war and bloodshed if Trump loses, which they are convinced could only happen if the election is rigged. When you combine these two traits, a penchant for violence and good old-fashioned stupidity, the result can sometimes be terrifying. Other times, it can be downright laughable. 
This would be a prime example of the latter. 
Meet John. John vehemently supports Trump and his plan to ¡°Make America Great Again.¡± Fearing a Clinton presidency, he has decided that if she wins the White House, he will have no choice to engage in an act of ¡°civil disobedience.¡± You know, to show the government that he means business and all. Consequently, this brilliant man has managed to come up with the dumbest act of ¡°civil disobedience¡± ever. 
So just what does John the genius plan to do? He¡¯s going to block the drive-thru at McDonald¡¯s. After all, this is where all the illegal immigrants are working. That¡¯s it. That¡¯s his scheme in its entirety. Blocking the drive-thru at McDonald¡¯s. Because, that¡¯ll show ¡¯em, dammit!

Trump supporters certainly don¡¯t represent the best and brightest that America has to offer. But despite the fact that the majority of them are idiots, it doesn¡¯t take a rocket scientist to fill out a ballot. These people will be voting. The only way to keep these racist morons from deciding the fate of the country is for Democrats to turn out in droves on Tuesday and defeat Trump in a landslide¡­even if it does mean that grabbing breakfast at McDonald¡¯s may take a little longer than usual on Nov. 9 due to a crazy guy blocking the drive-thru.

President Obama was interrupted by a protester while he was speaking at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton. Suffice it to say, Obama had the best reaction to a protester ever. Hands down. So, of course, Trump had to start lying about what happened. 
Speaking to a crowd in Hershey, PA, Trump said that the president had done quite literally the exact opposite of what he actually did . 
¡°You saw it today on television, right? He was talking to the protester, screaming at him, really screaming at him. By the way, if I spoke the way Obama spoke to that protester, they would say, ¡°He became unhinged! He became ¨C¡°You have to go back and look and study. And see what happened. They never moved the camera. And he spent so much time screaming at this protester and frankly, it was a disgrace.¡± 
Okay, so let¡¯s ¡°go back and look¡± at just how President Obama handled the situation today. When the protester interrupted him, the crowd was not having it. He struggled to quiet them as they chanted ¡°Hillary,¡± and when he succeeded, he began by reminding them of all the reasons they should treat this man with respect. Obama defended the protester¡¯s First Amendment rights and then told those in attendance that this is what he means when he says they aren¡¯t ¡°focused.¡± He concluded with his now trademark phrase, ¡°Don¡¯t boo, VOTE!¡±

In what may be the last bombshell to drop prior to Election Day, the Associated Press is now reporting that they have found the smoking gun that proves Melania Trump worked illegally in the United States prior to obtaining a work visa. 
This means: For all intents and purposes, Melania was the sort of ¡°illegal¡± immigrant that her husband now labels as criminals and morally-bankrupt. The Trump family lied about this fact and conspired to cover it up for the duration of the election. This comes at a supremely bad time for Trump, who recently made Melania a campaign centerpiece ¨C including a much publicized speech on¡­ you guessed it¡­ immigration. 
Here¡¯s what the AP found : 
The documents obtained by the AP show she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between Sept. 10 and Oct. 15, during a time when her visa allowed her generally to be in the U.S. and look for work but not perform paid work in the country. The documents examined by the AP indicate that the modeling assignments would have been outside the bounds of her visa. 
It is highly unlikely that the discovery will affect the citizenship status of Mrs. Trump. The government can seek to revoke the U.S. citizenship of immigrants after the fact in cases when it determines a person willfully misrepresented or concealed facts relevant to his naturalization. But the government effectively does this in only the most egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes. 
According to the documents, Melania made roughly $20,000 illegally before getting her visa ¨C only slightly less money in seven weeks than the average undocumented worker Trump disparages as ¡°moochers¡± make in a year . 
While existing standards mean Melania would likely remain a U.S. citizen despite her previous violations, her husband¡¯s plans to crack down on illegal immigration might be working against her. Trump has long held that people who ¡°cheated¡± to get into the United States illegally should be moved to the ¡°back of the line.¡± Would he include his wife in that sweeping category? 
Of course, Melania Trump should not be deported over a technicality in her early immigration status. However, her husband might want to think about that fact when he screams at rallies about rounding up families of Hispanic immigrants and shipping them out of the country. Melania is living proof that the immigration issue in this country isn¡¯t exactly cut-and-dry. Not that Trump is known for any semblance of nuance.

A casting call obtained by Fox News on Wednesday was apparently sent out by an ¡°up-and-coming conservative media network currently in development.¡± 
According to the casting call, the upstart network is searching the U.S. for hosts, reporters, and right-wing well-spoken contributors. 
The notice stresses that on-air talent ¡°must be knowledgeable about conservative viewpoints, current events, and the presidential election,¡± adding applicants must also ¡°look upscale and intelligent,¡± and should be ¡°outspoken and energetic.¡± 
The network is holding auditions at a secret New York City studio on November 7, just before election day. 
And while the casting call does not disclose the identity of the mystery employer, it does suggest that the network¡¯s first programming will be streamed online. Coincidentally, the Trump campaign has just set up it¡¯s online Facebook live feed, where his aides have been broadcasting Trump events and counter news programming. 
Vanity Fair was the first to report in June that Trump was thinking about starting his own media network. 
In September, the Financial Times reported that Trump¡¯s son-in-law Jared Kushner started making inquiries into launching a new media company after the election to capitalize on his father-in-law¡¯s political movement. 
However, Trump has openly dismissed the idea, and told the Washington Post last month: 
¡°I want to win the presidency, and I want to make America great again. It¡¯s very simple. I have no interest in a media company.¡± 
Wouldn¡¯t it be funny if one of his kids just so happened to start a media company after the election? 
Or perhaps Donald Trump just does it under his name, after all, it¡¯s not as if he¡¯s ever had a problem with lying, especially when it comes to business.

Scott Melker is a Miami-based DJ who reportedly attended the University of Pennsylvania at the same time as one of the sons of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. 
Melker recently shared a disturbing story on Facebook in which he claims that Trump very casually physically assaulted Donald Trump Jr. in front of his classmates, as well as the troubling behaviors of Don Jr., who he described as ¡°a drunk¡± who earned the nickname ¡°Diaper Don.¡± Image via Facebook 
Before we get ahead of ourselves, we should, of course, take it for what it is worth. This is just one man¡¯s account, and for all we know, Melker could have made the whole thing up. But Melker¡¯s account doesn¡¯t come across as exaggerated, the alleged interaction, while disturbing, seems very understated. 
And here¡¯s what we do know about Trump. 
He has bragged on video about how he felt his ¡°star¡± status gave him permission to routinely sexually assault random women by kissing them and grabbing their genitalia against their will. 
Trump has also been accused of committing numerous sexual assaults against women, including raping two young teenage girls. 
And according to his first wife, Trump did not have the best of relationships with his three oldest children. During a benefit a few weeks ago, Ivana Trump told the crowd that she ¡°brought up the children singlehandedly. Donald wasn¡¯t really interested in children until he could talk business with them.¡± 
With so many deep character flaws, it¡¯s not exactly a stretch of the imagination that he would physically lash out as well. 
If this story turns out to be true, it could explain a lot about why Trump¡¯s two oldest sons are the way they are, and it could foretell a very troubling future for Trump¡¯s youngest son Barron, who is only 10 years old.

It was a good morning for Ben Carson. No longer can it be said that he is Donald Trump¡¯s very worst campaign surrogate. The title now belongs to Mike Huckabee ¨C a very dim bulb in a low wattage room. 
In a turn that had people seriously questioning his mental health, the former Arkansas governor decided to use his patented ability to make lousy metaphors to compare Donald Trump to a car wreck.

¡ª Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) November 4, 2016

Hilariously, Huckabee seemed legitimately shocked and outraged that people took his analogy to mean he thought Donald Trump was a bad candidate.

There are two fundamental truths in this world: Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president. And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. 
In a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : ¡°Republicans, it is time to come home¡± https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I 
¡ª ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 
The Democratic Party couldn¡¯t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan¡¯s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan¡¯s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. 
The ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a ¡°principled¡± conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump¡¯s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan ¨C like many of his colleagues ¨C turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. 
What¡¯s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn¡¯t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. 
If 2016¡¯s very ugly election has done any good it¡¯s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events.

They also discussed elitism and religion. President Obama answered every question candidly and without hesitation. He even joked around with Maher when the subject of marijuana legalization came up. 
At the end of the interview, Maher brought up the election and the president had this to say to people who are still on the fence, or are choosing not to vote at all: 
¡°Anybody sitting on the sidelines right now, or deciding to engage in a protest vote ¡ª that¡¯s a vote for Trump, and that would be badly damaging to this country, and very damaging to the world. ¡° 
Bill Maher may have scored one of the most in-depth interviews with President Obama ever, and you won¡¯t want to miss it.

J.J. Holmes has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. He and his mother, Alison Holmes, attended a Trump rally on Saturday to protest the GOP nominee¡¯s mockery of people with disabilities. As they were being removed from the rally by security, Trump¡¯s supporters began pushing and kicking the child¡¯s wheelchair. 
¡°The crowd started chanting ¡®U-S-A¡¯ and pushing his wheelchair,¡± Alison said. ¡°We were put out by security. Mr. Trump kept saying, ¡®Get them out.¡¯¡± 
¡°I hate Donald Trump. I hate Donald Trump,¡± J.J. said through his vocalization device. 
The next day, J.J. and his mom got to meet the President of the United States after a rally for Hillary Clinton in Kissimmee, Florida. The experience was the polar opposite of what they had experienced the day before.

On Sunday, President Barack Obama was on the campaign trail stumping for Hillary Clinton in Florida when he started brutally mocking Donald Trump upon learning that his campaign may have taken away his Twitter account in the final days leading up to the election. 
The president couldn¡¯t help himself; he just had to go after the man who he characterized as being too immature to step into his job. 
¡°Apparently his campaign has taken away his Twitter,¡± Obama said during a Florida rally for Hillary Clinton , to laughs. 
The president then used humor to make a point to remind everyone of just what was at stake in this election. ¡°In the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self control, they said: ¡®We¡¯re just going to take away your Twitter.¡¯ Now, if somebody cant handle a Twitter account, they can¡¯t handle the nuclear code,¡± Obama continued. ¡°If somebody starts tweeting at three in the morning because SNL made fun of you, then you can¡¯t handle the nuclear codes.¡± 
On Sunday, the New York Times reported that Trump no longer controls his Twitter account. Instead, the Republican nominee appears to have aides creating ¡°Trump safe¡± messages on his behalf while he focuses his energy on whining and lying at his live rallies. 
During the rally in the battleground state of Florida, Obama labeled Trump as being ¡°uniquely unqualified¡± and ¡°temperamentally unfit¡± to serve as Commander-in-Chief. ¡°I¡¯ve been in this office now almost eight years and here¡¯s what I can tell you,¡± Obama said. ¡°Who you are, what you are, does not change when you take office. It just magnifies who you are. It just shines a spotlight on who are you.¡± Every day there¡¯s another example of how much of a complete joke Trump¡¯s campaign has been over the past year. But as much as we would love to laugh at this clown, we must first make sure he doesn¡¯t get elected. Or else the joke¡¯s on us.

The press has been praising GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump lately for staying on message on the campaign trail and avoiding feuds on Twitter. After all, the entire campaign has been dogged by Trump¡¯s Twitter meltdowns ¨C especially in cases where he did outrageous things like spending a week attacking the parents of a fallen soldier, and fat-shaming a beauty queen in the middle of the night while urging his millions of followers to check out a sex tape. 
The world watched in horror as a major party presidential nominee engaged in this childish, bullying behavior, and as his advisers and surrogates toured the talk shows cleaning up his messes. However, it seems that here in the 11th hour of this crazy election cycle, Trump¡¯s campaign aides have had enough of his coming unglued online. So, as if they are babysitting a toddler, they¡¯ve done the unthinkable and removed Trump¡¯s access to his own Twitter account . 
According to the New York Times, instead of allowing Trump to tweet when he feels like it, he and his aides craft careful tweets to send out to his millions of followers. The Times cites one instance where Hope Hicks, one of the campaign¡¯s spokespeople, helped Trump word a tweet chastising President Obama for stumping so much for Hillary. 
So, in other words, Trump has so little self-control that his social media has to be monitored like a child. He probably stomped, screamed, and ranted throughout Trump Tower when Kellyanne or whoever responsible for this decision took his phone away, but it seems that in the final days, the campaign knew that they¡¯d have no time to clean up any messes Trump might create for himself via Twitter. Therefore, they had no choice but to treat him like the small child who just happens to be occupying a 70-year-old man¡¯s body that he is. 
And to think ¨C in two days, this little boy could be in control of the world¡¯s most powerful nuclear arsenal.

By now, we all know that the Secret Service had to rush GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump off the stage at a rally in Reno, Nevada on Saturday night. It turned out to be nothing ¨C just a protester with a sign. At the time it all looked pretty chaotic and frightening, but it turned out that Trump was just fine. The ¡°gun¡± turned out to be an anti-Trump poster. The man turned out to be a Republican who just wanted the opportunity to protest what Trump had done to his party with a ¡°Republicans against Trump¡± sign. There was no threat. 
Those facts don¡¯t matter to the Trump team, though, as campaign manager Kellyanne Conway went on CNN¡¯s State of the Union and insisted to host Jake Tapper that it was indeed a very real attempt on Trump¡¯s life. 
First, Tapper inquired as to why Trump¡¯s people were ¡°retweeting misinformation that this was an assassination attempt.¡± Conway responded: 
¡°It¡¯s scary. All the coverage is usually about our protesters wreaking havoc and making people feel afraid. And it certainly goes both ways. I¡¯m with Mr. Trump and the Secret Service routinely. They do an amazing job. 
I also want to point out because some people are spreading misinformation about the protester. He had canvassed for Hillary Clinton and he had donated to her campaign. So, this is a Democratic plant or operative trying to disrupt our rally. And I think people saw a nimble resilient Donald Trump who would be nimble and resilient as president as well.¡± 
Tapper called Conway on her bullshit, though, and shot back: 
¡°Except it wasn¡¯t an assassination attempt. It was apparently a local voter, a Republican who says he is supporting Hillary Clinton. He has given money to Hillary Clinton. He has canvassed for Hillary Clinton. But he says he¡¯s a Republican. But most importantly, he was not trying to assassinate anyone.¡± 
This was not an assassination attempt, but why is your campaign spreading that it was?¡± 
Conway waffled, saying, ¡°That¡¯s really remarkable. That that¡¯s what the storyline is here.¡± 
Of course, she then did what Trumpkins backed into corners always do, and tried to start changing the subject to the imagined sins of Hillary Clinton. She insisted that the only reason Beyonce, Jay Z and other A-List stars were on the trail with Hillary was that nobody wanted to go to Hillary rallies. Finally, Conway said she¡¯d consider changing the assassination lie if CNN went on the record against ¡°all the storylines, all the headlines, all the breathless predictions of the last two weeks that turned out not to be true.¡± 
Tapper said to that: 
¡°I never reported anything along those lines.¡± 
And irritable Conway insisted: 
¡°CNN certainly has. You¡¯ve got to be honest here.¡± 
Tapper continued, ¡°We¡¯ve been saying all along that Donald Trump has a path to the presidency.¡± 
Conway then interjected with her trademark ¡°WOW!¡± 
Tapper plowed on, though, and nailed the humiliation home, and actually laughed in her face, saying: 
¡°You can say ¡®wow¡¯ all you want, I¡¯ve never said that the race was over. We can replay as many tapes as you want.¡± 
Tapper was right to hammer Conway like this. Trump¡¯s entire campaign has been one big con job, built upon fear, ignorance, bigotry, incompetence, and lies. It¡¯s about time someone called them out for what they really are.

A Republican unhappy that his party was being hijacked by Donald Trump attended a Trump rally to protest and found himself being swarmed first by an angry mob, then by Secret Service agents. The room full of Second Amendment fanatics panicked when one of Trump¡¯s fans yelled ¡°gun!¡± and Trump was rushed from the stage. Immediately, Trump¡¯s campaign began spinning the lie that this man had intended to assassinate Trump. 
In fact, all he was armed with was a poster saying ¡°Republicans Against Trump.¡± The whole incident was over nothing. But it didn¡¯t stop Trump¡¯s fans from pretending this proved Trump was a profile in courage.

But while the Secret Service did the right thing by not taking chances, the idea that this incident makes Trump brave is laughable. He returned to the stage precisely because there was no threat . Mere minutes after agents tackled the ¡°assassin¡± they realized the guy was a harmless protester carrying a poster and had no weapons. He was released shortly afterwards. 
Meanwhile, there is an example of a candidate staring down a scary situation and not blinking. It¡¯s Hillary Clinton.

Speaking at Hillary Clinton¡¯s rally in Philadelphia on the eve of the election, Michelle Obama had a warning for American voters: Choosing not to vote or casting a protest vote will put Donald Trump in the White House. 
The first lady also tried to make sure that the voters listening to her speech, whether in person or on television, understand just how important their vote really is. 
¡°And here¡¯s the beauty of it all, this election is on us. It is on us. If we get out and vote tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will win,¡± she said. ¡°But, if we stay home or if we play around with a protest vote, then Hillary¡¯s opponent will win. Period. End of story.¡± 
¡°Look, it is important to understand that presidential elections are breathtakingly close. They are decided by just 5, 10, 15 votes per precinct,¡± she added. 
Michelle Obama¡¯s passionate plea comes after a long and contentious campaign. Some people are convinced their vote doesn¡¯t matter. Some people are still pouting because their favorite candidate didn¡¯t win the primary. Others have swallowed the kool-aid and believe both candidates are the same. But Michelle Obama is right, not voting or voting for a third party candidate is the same as casting a vote for Trump. Quite frankly, there is just too much at stake for that this time around.

Rumors are circulating of who Donald Trump is considering to serve as his cabinet members if he wins on Tuesday, and the names on his list will chill you to the bone. 
According to several sources close to Trump, high ranking Republicans who have stood by the GOP nominee¡¯s side throughout the campaign have made the short list. Which means, of course, that he has chosen the worst of the worst. 
NBC reports : 
¡°Among the names being considered, according to conversations with three campaign advisers who requested anonymity to speak freely: Rudy Giuliani for attorney general, Newt Gingrich for secretary of state, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn for defense secretary or national security adviser, Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, and Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg for commerce secretary.¡± 
Reince Priebus, the current RNC chairman, is also being considered as a possibility to serve as Trump¡¯s chief of staff. He earned the favor of the bigoted billionaire by staunchly defending him time and time again when other Republicans were quick to jump ship. 
¡°They¡¯re thinking, ¡®We need to find that balance between someone who knows how Washington works and someone who shakes things up,'¡± the senior campaign adviser said. 
NBC points out that appointing Priebus as chief of staff would be ¡°an olive branch to the establishment,¡± but it isn¡¯t clear at the moment if the RNC chair would even consider taking the position. 
One veteran of the George W. Bush White House said that Trump¡¯s transition team had convinced him that they were looking for people to fill these positions that had ¡°experience¡± in Washington. 
¡°They¡¯re reaching out to people with experience, they¡¯re listening to them, they¡¯re taking their counsel,¡± the former official said. ¡°I was very impressed.¡± 
The NBC report did say that Trump really isn¡¯t putting the cart before the horse, so to speak. The sources they spoke to said the Trump campaign is ¡°focused on winning first and foremost as well and no decisions have been made or positions finalized.¡± Trump campaign spokesman Hope Hicks said that ¡°none of this is accurate¡± and added that Trump ¡°is entirely focused on the campaign and the American people.¡±

In an interview with The National , New Yorker journalist and New York Times best-selling author, Malcolm Gladwell, was asked by Wendy Mesley to predict what the next four years will look like after tomorrow¡¯s votes are in. 
With understandable trepidation, the show¡¯s host inquired what would happen if Trump wins, to which the English-born Canadian writer¡¯s answer was simple: 
¡°I think he¡¯ll be in jail within a year. We¡¯ve got the Trump University fraud case, we probably have criminal charges coming out of his charitable donation. We¡¯ve got all of the Russian ties we don¡¯t know much about. He¡¯s got so many legal problems, I suspect he¡¯ll spend the next few years huddled with his lawyers.¡± 
So, what does Gladwell think will happen when Hillary is elected? 
¡°Republicans in Congress will start an investigation of her on day one, which will only end when she leaves office four years later. The forecast for the next four years is just stalemate. Their hatred will not be satiated by a Hillary Clinton victory, it will be enhanced. For twenty years they have been coming after this woman and they¡¯re gonna keep coming after her.¡± Adding, ¡°It will result in some kind of political paralysis for sure.¡± 
Gladwell does not paint a very inspiring picture of a Clinton win, for sure, but it is better than the alternative. We all know Trump belongs in jail, but he can¡¯t be allowed to bring the entire nation down with him. In short, get your ass out and vote! 
Also, watch the full CBC interview where Gladwell discusses sexism, elitism, racism and the baffling media obsession with Hillary¡¯s emails:

We knew it was going to happen, and honestly, it could have been a lot worse. Still, it¡¯s shocking that this is what our elections have come to. 
A Trump supporter picked a fight with a voter at a Palm Beach polling place over his choice of candidate. The crazed right-winger ended up pulling a gun on the African American man who was simply trying to cast his vote. 
According to the victim , Tobian Norris, he was on his way to vote when he ran into a Trump supporter intent on causing trouble. 
¡°I saw this guy, he was basically soliciting votes for Donald Trump and he decided he wanted to solicit me,¡± Norris said. 
He says he made it clear that there was no way he would ever consider voting for Trump. After a brief discussion about Trump and his opponent, Hillary Clinton, Norris finally asked the Trump supporter if he had graduated high school and all hell broke loose. The man lunged at Norris, attacking him and knocking the phone he had been using to film the incident to the ground. 
¡°He grabbed my hand and knocked the phone out of my hand and called me the n-word, and I just blacked out and hit him in the ribs, and he pulled a gun on me,¡± Norris recalled. 
When Norris defended himself, punching the assailant in the ribs, the crazed man did what any good Trump supporter would do: He pulled out a gun. 
The victim ran and was thankfully unharmed. This could have ended so much worse. The Palm Beach County Sheriff¡¯s deputies arrived and arrested the gun toting Trump follower. 
Norris recorded the entire exchange and posted it live on Facebook. You can watch the video below:

Donald Trump, already laying the ground work for a ¡°rigged election¡± challenge after he loses, filed a frivolous lawsuit in Nevada that sought to erase the votes of many residents of Clark County because they dared wait line past the time polls closed (as was their legal right) and got their vote in during early voting. 
The lawsuit, on its face, was insane. Trump was arguing that people who waited in the long lines to vote should have been sent home once the polls officially closed. This is contrary to the law, which says that as long as a person is in line at the time of closing, they are legally entitled to cast their ballot. This is done specifically to ensure crooked politicians couldn¡¯t disenfranchise voters by intentionally making lines so long that the poll workers can¡¯t possibly get to all of the people.

Chris Christie was once one of Trump¡¯s fiercest critics ¨C shortly before endorsing him. Since that time, Christie has bounced from humiliation to humiliation at the hands of Trump. Stories of Trump¡¯s schoolyard bullying of Christie range from the time he made the Governor of New Jersey get him french fries, to the time he publicly mocked his weight, to the time he told Christie to get off the stage and wait on the plane, to the time he suggested Christie could be vice president only to change him mind at the last minute and pick Mike Pence instead. 
The last 16 months have been hard on Christie. The indignities were written all over his face as he walked, alone and in the dark , towards the voting booth in New Jersey. A man, broken and demoralized, casting a vote for the guy who routinely humiliated him. If a picture says a thousand words, then what does this say? Here's a picture of Christie going to vote this morning at 6:06 am, right when polls opened. He didn't tell press. https://t.co/3QIgk1sgBW pic.twitter.com/tJEMSwN1y0

Perhaps nobody in America had a worse year than Gov. Chris Christie ¨C and nobody has deserved his comeuppance more. All but conceding that his time in politics was over, the deeply unpopular governor ignored the job he was elected to do in New Jersey to fly around the country with Donald Trump. Those fast food orders weren¡¯t going to pick up themselves. 
In the meantime, the ¡°Bridgegate¡± scandal that had torched his administration was drawing to a close, with several of his former advisers implicating Christie himself in the plan to shut down traffic to punish a political rival. Just last week, things reached their inevitable conclusion with many of his closest staffers being convicted of the crimes. Christie, who has no possible route to office ever again, seems to understand that 2016 marked a Rubicon of sorts. He crossed the river and there is no going back. His reputation, his lifetime¡¯s work in government, his chances for a future presidency, have all gone up in smoke. 
And so he drudged in the bitterly cold New Jersey pre-dawn towards the ballot box. Broken, beaten, and hollow. Chris Christie casts his vote for Donald Trump; his abuser, yes, but also the only man who will take his calls.

Well, that sure didn¡¯t take long. Only 12 hours into Election Day and Eric Trump has already broken the law. 
The Trump family isn¡¯t known for their ability to follow the law. Eric Trump apparently decided to start off his day by voting for his narcissistic dad and then breaking the law by posting a picture of his completed ballot on Twitter. Image via Buzzfeed 
This just happens to violate New York election law. Oops. But hey, it¡¯s not like this has been a law for a long time right? Only 126 years. The law stipulates that any person who ¡°[s]hows his ballot after it is prepared for voting, to any person so as to reveal the contents ¡­ is guilty of a misdemeanor.¡± 
Eric Trump was quickly notified that his tweet, featuring a pic of his ballot, was illegal. Image via Buzzfeed 
The law was recently challenged by a group of voters who asked a federal judge to issue an injunction that would allow voters to take ballot selfies. The judge denied their request, ruling on Nov. 3 that, ¡°The public¡¯s interest in orderly elections outweighs the plaintiffs¡¯ interest in taking and posting ballot selfies.¡± 
According to the judge, the posting of ballot selfies would slow down the voting process, causing unnecessary delays, and threaten the guarantee of ¡°election integrity.¡± 
Eric Trump eventually removed his tweet, but thanks to screenshots, it hasn¡¯t actually gone away. I have to ask at this point, can¡¯t these people get anything right? Seriously, they managed to screw up voting? By breaking the law? With Twitter ? Of course, they did.

It¡¯s do or die time for Trump, and so not surprising the lies are rolling in at a record speed ¨C this time involving a fake celebrity endorsement by Super Bowl champ, Tom Brady. 
Up until now, the New England Patriots quarterback has remained silent on who he will be voting for in Election 2016, but the cat is out of the bag and it¡¯s in direct contrast to what Trump is saying. 
At a Manchester, New Hampshire, rally Monday night, Trump shared with the crowd a phone call he supposedly received from his buddy Brady, where Tom told the Republican presidential candidate he had voted for him. Trump told the cheering crowd: 
¡°Great guy, great friend of mine ¡ª great, great champion. Unbelievable winner. He called today and he said, ¡®Donald, I support you, you¡¯re my friend, and I voted for you. And I said, ¡®So Tom. You voted for me, you support me, am I allowed to say it tonight at this massive crowd in New Hampshire?¡¯ He said, ¡®If you want to say it, you can say it.¡¯ OK? Tom, that¡¯s what a champ is all about.¡± 
Watch Trump¡¯s embarrassing display of buddy name-dropping here: 
But there are a couple of problems with this glowing endorsement. Just hours before, on Boston¡¯s ¡°Kirk & Callahan Show¡± on WEEI Tom Brady said he hadn¡¯t voted yet. Since early voting in Massachusetts ended Friday, he could not have voted in the hours between the show and the phone call, unless he mailed his ballot in, which is highly unlikely. 
But what is most damning is an exchange his wife, supermodel Gisele B¨¹ndchen, had on her Instagram page on Friday. 
When a follower asked, ¡°Gisele I heard you and Tom were backing Trump! Is that true???¡± 
Gisele responded with a resounding, ¡°NO!¡± 
Here is the exchange as posted on Twitter by Chris Sacca: Three days ago on Instagram, @giseleofficial told a random dude she and Brady weren't backing Donald. ?? pic.twitter.com/oiAcUgqkKK

Granted, it is possible Tom Brady lied to Trump. Tom isn¡¯t exactly known for his honesty, having been suspended for the first four games of this NFL season for cheating in the now infamous Deflategate Scandal . 
Either way, Gisele¡¯s posting speaks volumes about who she and her husband WILL be voting for. Perhaps ending the Brady-Trump bromance for good.

Donald Trump is not very popular in New York City. Obviously, he lives in his big tower with his name in gold on the city¡¯s famed Fifth Avenue, but if the images of him walking into his polling place to vote for himself are any indication, what he thinks of himself isn¡¯t what the people of New York City think of him. 
As Trump went to vote with his wife Melania and daughter Ivanka, flanked by Secret Service agents, he was booed loudly by voters waiting in line. This isn¡¯t surprising if you¡¯ve lived in New York, as I have. It is always a blue state, and it is also extraordinarily accepting of all people. Trump, however, throughout his travesty of a campaign run on hatred, fear, ignorance, and bigotry, has shown himself to be the exact opposite of most New Yorkers. 
If this video is any indication, it seems that the start of Election Day does not bode well for how it will end for Trump and his hateful supporters.

After a trainwreck campaign, Trump supporters are struggling to find ways to motivate people to vote for their candidate. Trump has alienated nearly every voting bloc in the country, and routinely smears the sort of people who would otherwise be undecided voters. The question for his supporters is how to get people to set aside their hatred for the man and cast their vote for him anyway. For one horse breeder, the answer is semen. 
In what has been described as ¡°gross,¡±¡°totally illegal,¡± and the most Trumpian thing ever, a Texas Trumper posted on his Facebook page that he would be giving a 50 percent off coupon to all Trump voters good for either one breeding session with his stallions, or frozen semen for the horse owner on the go.

Donald Trump¡¯s shocking presidential win last night has left most of the world in mortified awe, but one leader seems especially pleased by the upset, perhaps because he had something to do with it. 
Just hours after Trump took the stage to deliver his acceptance speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated the president-elect on his win. It was only three weeks ago, at the third presidential debate that Hillary Clinton said Trump would be Putin¡¯s ¡°puppet¡± and it looks like Putin is eager to take on the master¡¯s role. 
Speaking from the Kremlin, Putin specifically praised Trump on his vow to restore relations with Russia: 
¡°We understand the way to that will be difficult, taking into account the current state of degradation of relations between the US and Russia. As I have repeatedly said, that is not our fault that Russia-US relations are in that state. Russia is ready and wants to restore the fully-fledged relations with the US. I repeat we understand this will be difficult, but we are ready to play our part in it.¡± 
And what part will Trump play? Ask Sergei Markov. The pro-Kremlin political analyst, who was equally thrilled by the election outcome, is confident Trump will have America do a 180 on the Syrian debacle and join Russia in its backing of Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. 
There is every reason to believe the analyst, too. At the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, Hillary Clinton joked that Trump was ¡® healthy as a horse ¨C you know the one Vladimir Putin rides on¡¯. It looks like she might be right. Trump has always seemed a bit cozy with the Russian president , but now he may actually owe him a debt of gratitude for the Kremlin¡¯s part in his win. 
In relation to Russian interference in the election, Markov said, ¡°Maybe we helped a bit with WikiLeaks.¡± 
Up until now the Kremlin has denied any involvement; Putin calling The Obama administration¡¯s accusations they hacked Democratic Party emails, then leaking them to WikiLeaks, as ¡°nonsense¡± claims. 
Markov did admit it might not be all smooth riding, adding, ¡°Putin is a macho, Trump is also a macho. Maybe it could be a problem.¡± 
Alexei Venediktov, the editor-in-chief of Russia¡¯s liberal Echo of Moscow radio, agrees: ¡°Putin doesn¡¯t like unpredictability and Trump is the definition of unpredictability.¡± 
I guess we will just have to see who will be riding whom.

On November 8, 2016, an almost evenly divided America made a consequential choice. 
And in the end, they chose to elect the least most qualified candidate in U.S. history to become the 45th President of the United States of America. 
However, one Twitter user said something so profound, that it should send a chill up the spine of any decent and rational American. The tweet said: 
¡°Our first black president will have to have over the White House to someone endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. Just let that sink in.¡± Our first black president will have to hand over the White House to someone endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. Just let that sink in.

Yes, we should all allow that sink in for a few moments. 
After the election, neo-Nazis, Alt-Righters, White Supremacists, and the Ku Klux Klan are all celebrating Trump¡¯s election. 
Meanwhile, few, if any, minorities are doing the same, because they understand what his presidency will mean for their lives and the lives of their children. 
And while we can keep telling ourselves that ¡°this is not who we are,¡± it¡¯s important to recognize that it was that same denial that brought us to this point in our history. 
It¡¯s time we took a hard look in the mirror and at the country we¡¯ve created.

In what amounts to the first pang of just how profound America¡¯s Election Day screw up truly was, Trump¡¯s campaign is reportedly already working on a plan to scrub that last eight years of progress out of existence on Trump¡¯s very first day in office . No Obama accomplishment will remain. They even have a name for the plan: The First Day Project. 
Organized by the Heritage Foundation, the goal is to deprive Obama of any lasting effect to his time in office. It¡¯s a perverse sort of vengeance from a group of clowns who have spent the last decade smearing the president at every possible step of the way. 
Trump aides are organizing what one Republican close to the campaign calls the First Day Project. ¡°Trump spends several hours signing papers¡ªand erases the Obama Presidency,¡± he said. Stephen Moore, an official campaign adviser who is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, explained, ¡°We want to identify maybe twenty-five executive orders that Trump could sign literally the first day in office.¡± 
Thinking back over Obama¡¯s list of wins ¨C from gay rights to healthcare to the economy ¨C the idea that these achievements can be erased by a collective of spiteful, bitter men in a matter of hours is almost too much to bear. The suffering to the people whose rights will surely be rolled back will be immense. 
And on a separate, but equally terrifying front, Trump¡¯s campaign surrogate Omarosa told reporters that Trump has been compiling an ¡°enemies list¡±¨C an assortment of people on the right and left who openly stood against him ¨C and he plans on punishing those on the list when he gets to office. 
¡°I would never judge anybody for exercising their right to and the freedom to choose who they want. But let me just tell you, Mr. Trump has a long memory and we¡¯re keeping a list.¡± 
Erase his predecessor, punish his enemies. In this way, with pen and sword, Trump plans to dismantle a democracy. The oldest, greatest one in the world ¨C up until the point when it wasn¡¯t.

It¡¯s almost statistically impossible that you haven¡¯t heard at least one person threaten to move to Canada if Donald Trump won the presidential election. Well, he did. And it appears that at least some of those would-be emigrants weren¡¯t kidding. At around 11 pm Tuesday night ¨C just as things really went to hell for Hillary Clinton ¨C Canada¡¯s immigration website began to receive record breaking traffic. It then crashed completely. 
In case you were wondering, moving to Canada can be quite difficult . It may even take years. To some degree it depends on what profession you¡¯re in and how desired the work you do would be to the nation of Canada. Upon writing this the website still will not load reliably; but in the off chance it¡¯s running properly by the time you read this I¡¯ve included a link ( HERE ). 
The world¡¯s stock markets have been sent into turmoil at the shocking news that reality tv star Donald Trump actually pulled off the win. But if you¡¯re thinking of moving to Canada just because of the impending stock market Armageddon, don¡¯t bother. It¡¯s likely that the whole world will go into another recession if Trump really scraps the trade deals he¡¯s promising to. Sort of like a Brexit on a much bigger scale. In fact, many are saying that the combined influence of the UK¡¯s departure from the EU and ours from the majority of our trade relationships might spell a very wide-spread fiscal crisis. 
Trump, for one, tried to calm these fears in his victory speech. He said that he plans to deal with everyone ¡°fairly.¡± But this is unlikely to work. The market ultimately responds cautiously to change and whether that change is going to be fair or not doesn¡¯t really make much difference. Trump has promised to do away with the establishment. And that¡¯s likely to scare economists. One can only hope that as our new president, he proceeds with the cautious tone he could not find during the campaign. Or we could just all move to Canada.

Donald Trump has a Twitter problem. He has so little self-control when it comes to his chosen form of communication that in the final days of his presidential run, Trump¡¯s team actually took control of his Twitter account away from him. Well, it seems that now that the election is over, Trump is back in control of that account, and he will be the president of out of control tweets. 
As everyone knows by now, Trump¡¯s new position as President-elect has sparked nationwide protests by people who are standing against the hate and bigotry that Trump represents.

¡ª Maddow Blog (@MaddowBlog) November 10, 2016 
Notoriously thin-skinned, the moment Trump got his Twitter account back, he let loose in a rage for the ages, accusing the protesters of being paid to do what they are doing, and of being incited by a biased media. Here is a screenshot of that tweet, just in case someone around him decides it would be wise to delete it: 
So, in other words, Trump has once again showed America how temperamentally unfit he is to be president. If people exercising their First Amendment rights in protesting him and his policies provokes this kind of reaction, what will he do with the nuclear codes and the power of the presidency at his disposal? What will he do when a foreign leader insults him, or stands up to him or disagrees with him? We should all be terrified at the thought of such a situation.

In one of the oddest tweets Trump has ever sent, the president-elect said he had a ¡°really good meeting¡± and ¡°great chemistry¡± (what?) with Obama. He added that his wife really liked Michelle Obama, as well. A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot! 
¡ª Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 
¡°Chemistry?¡± Really? What a creep. 
The feeling did not appear to be mutual. After the meeting, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that the two men had views that were so radically different from one another that neither man even tried to discuss them during their first meeting. Obama also reiterated that he stood by calling Trump ¡° unfit ¡± for office. 
Asked whether the President still considers Trump ¡°temperamentally unfit¡± and ¡°uniquely unqualified¡± after the pair met for the first time Thursday morning, Earnest said that Obama stood by those remarks. 
¡°Look, the president¡¯s views haven¡¯t changed,¡± Earnest said. ¡°He stands by what he said on the campaign trail. He had an opportunity to make his argument. He made that argument vigorously. He made that argument in states all across the country. But the American people decided.¡± 
It was also reported that the Obamas decided to cancel a photo op with Donald and Melania Trump scheduled for after the meeting. (The White House denied that anything was meant by the cancellation, naturally.) 
Trump¡¯s sudden aboutface on Obama only reinforces what many had suspected all along. His nasty remarks, his damaging rhetoric, his vicious smears on the president were all lies he used as a blunt force instrument to convince his base to vote for him. He knew they were lies when he said them, he simply didn¡¯t care if they were being used to destroy Obama¡¯s reputation to get what he wanted. Now that he¡¯s won the election, those lies have outgrown their usefulness. 
But lest one think this represents a ¡°pivot¡± to maturity, just eight minutes later, he promptly descended into a temper tantrum unbecoming of a president. Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! 
¡ª Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 
The man who up until the day of the election was screaming about rigged voting machines and illegal voters suddenly thinks protesting his election is ¡°very unfair.¡± He also tapped into his favorite few scapegoats ¨C¡°professional protesters¡± (i.e. Democrats) and the media. In one tweet, we get a glimpse at just how ugly Trump¡¯s administration will be. People who criticize him will be publicly attacked by the president himself. The media who covers him will be demonized. And Trump will spend more time whining than governing. 
Pathetic.

Now that the election is over, Donald Trump is deciding who he will appoint to fill his cabinet. Although most the names on his list are fairly horrifying, none more so than who he is considering for White House Chief of Staff. Trump¡¯s top pick is reportedly former Breitbart bigwig, Steve Bannon. 
So what does a chief of staff do ? Well, the person holding this position is often called ¡°the most powerful man in Washington.¡± 
¡°The duties of the White House chief of staff vary, yet traditionally encompass the following, such as: select and supervise key White House staff, control access to the Oval Office and the president, manage communications and information flow, and negotiate with Congress, executive branch agencies, and external political groups to implement the president¡¯s agenda.¡± 
¡°In fulfilling these duties, the chief of Staff oversees and coordinates the efforts of the following offices within the EOP and White House Office: the Council of Economic Advisers, National Security staff, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Legislative Affairs, and Office of Management and Administration, to name a few.¡± 
Okay, so that¡¯s an important job. So who the hell is Steve Bannon? Not surprisingly, he is the worst of the worst. 
David Badash over at The New Civil Rights Movement summed it up quite nicely: Bannon ¡°stepped down at Breitbart to run the final few months of Trump¡¯s campaign, but for years he has run one of the most popular far, far right wing websites, Breitbart. It masquerades as a news site but it¡¯s home to the alt-right, as Bannon has bragged. In other words, the white supremacists and white nationalists, the anti-Semites, the anti-LGBT crowd, the anti-Black crowd, the anti-diversity, anti-feminism, anti-Obama movement. Racists, homophobes, bigots of every stripe get their ¡®news¡¯ at Breitbart. And it got Trump elected.¡± 
According to court filings from his divorce proceedings, Bannon is not only a sadistic wife beater , but he is also every bit as anti-Semitic as Breitbart itself. His wife testified that he fought against allowing his daughters to attend an upscale school because of the number of Jewish children that attended. 
¡°He said that he doesn¡¯t like the way they raise their kids to be ¡®whiny brats¡¯ and that he didn¡¯t want the girls going to school with Jews.¡± 
This man , this is who Trump wants to have serving as the White House Chief of Staff. His advisors are encouraging him to choose RNC Chair Reince Priebus, but we all know how Trump is with taking advice from people who might actually know what they¡¯re talking about. Who cares if Bannon actually knows anything about how to run the damn country, Trump just wants the biggest bigot he can find.

Meet Melania Trump. America¡¯s new First Lady. It would be completely pointless to try and compare her to the eloquent Michelle Obama or any other former First Lady for that matter. The best way to get to know the wife of President-elect Donald Trump is to, well, compare her to him. 
Their differences are glaring. She is an immigrant; he hates immigrants. She speaks five languages; he¡¯s barely mastered one. But they do have a lot in common as well. Melania¡¯s father was a Communist party member; and as Putin can attest, Donald likes Communists . 
They also both really love Donald. In her speech at the Republican rally in Berwyn, Philadelphia on November 3, 2016, Melania said about Donald, ¡°He knows how to get things done. He certainly knows how to shake things up, doesn¡¯t he?¡± 
You can watch her speech here: 
Melania was apparently talking her husband¡¯s approach to politics but was she really. In 1998, at the tender age of 28, the Yugoslav-born former model, Melania Knauss, met Donald Trump at a fashion party. He was still married to Marla Maples and was on a date with another woman. He sent his date to the washroom so he could get Melania¡¯s phone number. Yep, he knows how to get ¡®er done in a variety of areas. 
But Melania knows how to shake things up, too. Just ask Howard Stern. In 1999, Melania participated in an on-air radio conversation with the shock jock. 
¡°Are you naked? Are you nude?¡± Howard asked Melania. 
¡°Almost,¡± she said. 
¡°Ahhh, I¡¯ve got my pants off already,¡± replied Howard. 
Like her husband, she apparently loves getting her picture taken as well. You can check out some of the most un-First Lady like pictures here when Melania was profiled in 2000 by GQ. The photos were posted online again in March 2016. Included in the spread, which took place on Trump¡¯s customized Boeing 727, is Melania spread out naked on the bed.

On Thursday, a senior Russian diplomat revealed that the Russian government did meet with members of Donald Trump¡¯s presidential campaign during the election. This disclosure reopens scrutiny concerning what role the Kremlin might have played in the president-elect¡¯s close and contentious race against Hillary Clinton. 
Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that he never had contact with the Russian government. 
¡°I can tell you I think if I came up with that they¡¯d say, ¡®Oh, it¡¯s a conspiracy theory, it¡¯s ridiculous,¡¯¡± Trump told CBS4¡¯s Jim DeFede during an interview at his golf resort in Doral. ¡°I mean I have nothing to do with Russia. I don¡¯t have any jobs in Russia. I¡¯m all over the world but we¡¯re not involved in Russia.¡± 
When asked about outstanding loans with Russian banks or investors, Trump replied in July: 
¡°Absolutely not. It¡¯s ridiculous.¡± 
Meanwhile, during his campaign, Trump repeatedly refused requests to disclose his tax returns to the American people. 
Experts still speculate that Trump¡¯s tax returns could contain damaging information regarding his relationship with a foreign government or business interest. 
During an interview with Russia¡¯s state-run Interfax News, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed that ¡°there were contacts¡± with Trump¡¯s team during the election. 
¡°Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage,¡± Rybakov said. ¡°Those people have always been in the limelight in the United States and have occupied high-ranking positions. I cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives.¡± 
¡°We have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future Donald Trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes,¡± Ryabkov was quoted as saying. 
¡°We continue this work of course,¡± he added . 
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Bloomberg that it¡¯s ¡°normal practice¡± for Russian Embassy staff to meet with U.S. presidential campaigns. 
Zakharova added that Clinton rejected similar requests to meet during the campaign. 
From Moscow with love comrade Trump.

Nobody is more disgusted and disappointed in the election results than President Barack Obama, whose legacy of progress is poised to be undone overnight by a belligerent con man. And apparently the first meeting between current and future presidents was off to a rocky start ¨C culminating with Obama abruptly breaking with tradition and not giving Trump the satisfaction of a publicity win on this sad day. 
According to reporters at the White House , Obama cancelled a planned ¡°photo op¡± with Trump shortly after meeting him, depriving the president-elect of the chance to appear alongside the current president and gain an air of legitimacy. 
The Obamas canceled a photo-op of the current and future first couples outside the south entrance of the White House. In his first visit to the White House after the 2008 election, Mr. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama posed for the cameras alongside President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush. The decision not to participate in this tradition illustrates how bitter the campaign was, particularly for Mrs. Obama who delivered some of the most emotional arguments against electing Mr. Trump. 
It may also suggest that Obama¡¯s first meeting with Trump went about as badly as expected. The president had hoped to press Trump on the importance of governing the country with a semblance of dignity, as well as making the case that spending his first day in office signing a bunch of executive orders to erase Obama¡¯s legacy out of spite would be a horrific start to his time in office. It appears that Trump was not in the a mood to listen. 
Mr. Earnest said Mr. Obama would go through with Mr. Trump the policies he has implemented that he hopes his successor won¡¯t undo. But Mr. Trump is expected to attempt to unravel much of Mr. Obama¡¯s legacy, with plans to reverse his policies on health care, climate change, immigration and government regulations, and to dramatically shift his foreign-policy approach. 
The fact that Obama would break this tradition ¨C a symbolic gesture of the peaceful transition of power ¨C implies he is keenly aware that the man about to take over is a walking, talking disaster. A pathological liar and narcissist who has surrounded himself with a team of goons that he can count on to tell him what he wants to here and claw their way up his coattails at every chance. No photo op is going to change this tragedy from unfolding.

The White house is refusing to deny the rumors that President Obama claimed he will relocate to Canada if Donald Trump is elected as his successor in November. 
The rumor began when Canadian satire website The Burred Street Journal ran a fictional story titled ¡°Obama Declares His Family Will Move To Canada If Trump Is Elected.¡± 
The story was complete with a fake statement from Obama which read, ¡°It¡¯s something Michelle, the kids and I have discussed as a potential solution to the Donald. I have also spoken with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau who outlined Canada¡¯s generous immigration policy for wealthy individuals, so we¡¯ll see.¡± 
The story was immediately picked up by American newsrooms, who ran it with headlines like ¡°Obama Just Said He¡¯s Moving If Trump Is Elected, Sounds Good To Us!¡± 
When asked about the rumors, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would not say outright that Obama is not considering a move to Canada should the American people elect Trump. 
¡°He¡¯s working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn¡¯t support,¡± said Earnest, according to MRC Blog . 
While this all originated as a rumor, the White House¡¯s decision not to categorically deny the reports had any validity only makes it appear as though Obama may actually consider moving out of the country if Trump is elected.

Sometimes racial profiling doesn¡¯t work in your favor. That¡¯s what an MSNBC reporter found out when he tried to interview a group of three black citizens in line for early voting in South Carolina. 
The reporter deliberately tried to bait the black voters into saying something negative about Trump, and was shocked to find out that they were actually supporters of the Republican nominee. 
¡°We¡¯ve heard a lot of criticism of Trump¡¯s inner city policy, but what do you make of that criticism? I¡¯m sure you¡¯ve heard it¡­¡± questioned the reporter.

¡°Theya??re not racists or rednecks, theya??re actually pretty decent people,¡± Moore surprisingly said of Trump supporters. ¡°So, after talking to a number of them, I sort of wanted to sort of write this.¡± 
Here is an excerpt from his speech: 
Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said: if you close these factories, as you are planning to do in Detroit, and rebuild them in Mexico, I am going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobodya??s going to buy them. 
It was an amazing thing to see. 
No politician a?? Republican or Democrat a?? had ever said anything like that to these executives. And it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Brexit states. You live here in Ohio. You know what I am talking about. 
Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because he¡¯s saying the things to people who are hurting. And it¡¯s why every beaten down, nameless, forgotten, working stiff, who used to be part of what was called the working class, loves Trump. He is the human Molotov cocktail that they¡¯ve been waiting for; the human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them.

His method of deciphering right from wrong was pretty simple¡­ he looked for the truth. 
The question he asked himself was: ¡°What common traits bind Clinton supporters together?¡± 
You¡¯re going to fully support the answer he came up with¡­ 
Check this out! 
¡°I¡¯ve been trying to figure out what common trait binds Clinton supporters together. As far as I can tell, the most unifying characteristic is a willingness to bully in all its forms. Have a Trump sign in your lawn? They will steal it. If you have a Trump bumper sticker, they will deface your car. 
If you speak of Trump at work you could get fired. On social media, almost every message I get from a Clinton supporter is a bullying type of message¡­We know from Project Veritas that Clinton supporters tried to incite violence at Trump rallies. The media downplays it. We also know Clinton¡¯s side hired paid trolls to bully online. You don¡¯t hear much about that¡­¡± 
See what happens for people that actually ¡°think¡± things through? They come up with logical answers and start off on whatever endeavor they are facing on the right foot! 
He¡¯s absolutely right! Clinton followers tend to yell and judge everyone else for ¡°sins¡± that they themselves are living in as they are pointing the finger at others! All things racist, sexist, bigoted, and telling us all we are these things because we lack tolerance, when in fact, that isn¡¯t the case at all¡­is BULLYING! 
Which is rather IRONIC don¡¯t you think? Because they also go on and on about how they are against bullying and we all need to be tolerant. Yet are constantly inciting violence, and condoning intimidation towards ALL who do not agree with them. 
Here¡¯s the endorsement, and it¡¯s glorious. 
¡°I endorse Donald Trump for President of the United States because I oppose bullying in all its forms. I don¡¯t defend Trump¡¯s personal life. Neither Trump nor Clinton are role models for our children. Let¡¯s call that a tie, at worst. Today I put Trump¡¯s odds of winning in a landslide back to 98%. Remember, I told you a few weeks ago that Trump couldn¡¯t win unless ¡®something changed.¡¯ Something just changed.¡± 
That¡¯s right. Trump is no angel, but Hillary is Satan. Trump loves America and for now, in the state we are in, that¡¯s going to do a WHOLE lot of good. Some feel this election is about picking your poison, which is the least potent. I believe, it¡¯s about picking what¡¯s best for America. First step¡­would be choosing someone who loves this country.

The Trump plane stopped in the mud. It broke through a thin veneer of concrete designed to give way to keep planes from sliding into the river. 
No one was injured in the incident. Authorities say there could have been fatalities had the plane ended up in the water. 
KTLA 5 reports : 
Rescue crews were responding to the scene. The incident took place during a rainy night in the city. 
The press pool in the back of the aircraft could feel the plane fishtailing as it touched down and sliding off the runway before coming to a very sharp halt in the grass off the side of the runway. 
¡°We could feel the plane moving, and it was just not a natural landing that you experience,¡± CNN¡¯s Elizabeth Landers, who was on the plane, told CNN¡¯s Erin Burnett on ¡°OutFront.¡± 
Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Donald Trump¡¯s campaign, said the businessman called Pence shortly after the incident, adding that Trump ¡°is very glad everyone on-board the plane is safe.¡± 
There was some noticeable damage to the runway. A campaign spokesperson told reporters there was no structural damage to the plane. 
Landers said the Indiana governor¡¯s trip to New York had initially been delayed due to inclement weather. His plane was kept in a ground hold at the airport in Fort Dodge, Iowa, earlier in the day. 
Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the Department of Transportation, explained to CNN¡¯s Anderson Cooper that the weather likely prevented the plane from getting ¡°good traction.¡± There were 37 people on board at the time of the accident, including Pence. 
This could have been tragic. It is exponentially safer to fly in a plane than it is to ride in a car, but accidents still happen.

Trump supporters are popping up all across the world. 
Check out the scene that unfolded in Jerusalem¡¯s Old City this week. 
On a rooftop overlooking the walls of Jerusalem¡¯s Old City, around 200 American-Israeli fans of Donald Trump gathered to proclaim their support for the Republican candidate, convinced he will be Israel¡¯s best friend if elected. 
Wearing ¡°Make America Great Again¡± baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didn¡¯t care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters. 
¡°Trump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, that¡¯s what I like,¡± David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday. 
¡°He¡¯s not a saint, but look at his achievements. He¡¯s not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and he¡¯s not going to support the two-state solution,¡± he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians. 
Trump has noticed the support he is getting in Israel. 
He even had a message for the people over there. 
This is a far cry from the attitude Obama has had all this time towards Israel. There are many things that Obama should be ashamed of from the past 8 years. He¡¯s ruined America.

On August 29th, 2015, just after news broke that Huma Abedin¡¯s husband, Anthony Weiner, had been sexting young women, again, Trump said something that has turned out to be both profound and prophetic. 
¡°I only worry in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have close proximity to highly classified information.¡± 
He has also said: 
¡°Her No. 1 person, Huma Abedin, is married to Anthony Weiner, who¡¯s a sleazeball and pervert,¡± Trump said, referring to the former New York congressman¡¯s repeated scandals over lewd texts and direct Twitter messages he sent to other women. ¡°I¡¯m not saying that, that¡¯s recorded history,¡± Trump continued. ¡°I don¡¯t like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets.¡± 
Trump intuitively knew that Hillary¡¯s top aide, Huma Abedin, was a massive liability. 
Now look at what just happened today! 
The New York Times reports: 
The FBI is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The Bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case ¨C one federal official said they numbered in the thousands ¨C potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the Presidential Campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J.

Let that sink in. 
The FBI had closed the Hillary Clinton email investigation, and now has reopened it after finding emails on Anthony Wieners devices as part of a sexting scandal and investigation. 
Trump was right about Huma and Wiener! 
There are other scandals that intersect with this one, as well. 
The pay-for-play questions that have been raised about the Clinton Foundation are in play, as Huma Abedin worked daily with the Clintons on countless issues.

Here is Trump¡¯s full statement: 
I need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement.? The FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new emails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton¡¯s investigation.? And they are re-opening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United Staes of America. 
Hillary Clinton¡¯s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood and it is everybody¡¯s hope that it is about to be corrected. 
So that is a big announcement that I heard ten minutes ago, and I guess obviously most of you folks? have heard about. And in all fairness, for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less, including just recently 4-Star General James Cartwright, General Petraeus, and many others. Perhaps finally justice will be done.

With just 10 days to go before the most important election of our lifetime, Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans are soaring in the polls. The Friday announcement that the FBI would be re-opening its investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s personal email server has not helped matters for Democrats, either. 
But none of this will matter if they are able to manipulate the vote. According to MRC Blog , that¡¯s why the left is going to drastic measures to drum up Democratic voters, expanding voting rights to include non-citizens in major cities nationwide. 
The latest notable city to do so is San Francisco, whose Election Day ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city¡¯s public schools to vote in school board elections. Under this measure, people with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all would be allowed to vote. 
San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, who believes illegal aliens should be allowed to vote to bypass the ¡°broken immigration system in this country,¡± made the following statement: 
¡°One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn¡¯t have a voice. We¡¯ve had legal immigrants who¡¯ve had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.¡± 
Chiu is the son of Taiwanese immigrants. 
It is no secret that the vast majority of illegal aliens vote Democrat, because that is the party which is incessantly trying to buy their loyalty with an endless stream of handouts and promises of blanket amnesty. If it weren¡¯t so, we wouldn¡¯t see all of these liberals pushing so hard to give illegals voting rights; they simply do so because it works in their favor, not because it is actually good for anyone. 
Major cities from sea to shining sea are following San Francisco¡¯s lead, which is just one more very important reason to vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 8.

An artificial intelligence (AI) system which correctly predicted the last three elections has put Donald Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. 
The system is called MogIA, and it was founded in 2004 by Sanjiv Rai, the brains behind the Indian start-up Genic.ai. 
20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. are compiled and analyzed to come up with a prediction. 
It was also determined that enthusiasm for Trump is much higher than it was for Barack Obama in 2008. In fact, Trump has overtaken Obama¡¯s popularity that year by a whopping 25%.

During his final few months in the Senate, senile old Harry Reid has saved his most insane accusation for last. 
He is accusing the FBI Director of treason due to his announcement that the department is searching additional documents that could provide information related to the Hillary Clinton email probe. 
What a loony. 
In a last ditch effort to save dirty Clinton, Reid accused the FBI chief of violating the Hatch Act, in other words, acting with political motives as a government official. Reid concluded that the FBI director violated this act by sending his letter to Congress days before Election Day. 
Reid stated that according to CBS News ,¡°Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another,¡± Then he added that that through Comey¡¯s ¡°partisan actions, you may have broken the law.¡± Harry Reid: FBI Director Comey¡¯s ¡®Partisan Actions¡¯ May Violate Federal Law ¨C Letter: pic.twitter.com/agXy4D1igh 
¡ª Ryan Ruggiero (@RyanRuggiero) October 30, 2016 
Violations of the Hatch Act are a serious offense (you might recall this, because numerous Obama Administration officials have been accused of violating the federal law with zero action taken against them. 
¡°[Y]our highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group,¡± Reid wrote. 
In providing examples of what he claims are a violation of the Hatch Act, Reid pointed to the ¡°selective approach:¡± Comey¡¯s refusal to of investigate Trump and his possible campaign ties to the Russian government. 
¡°In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government ¨C a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity,¡± he said. ¡°I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public¡­ and yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.¡± 
¡°You¡¯re rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton,¡± he said. 
The Hatch Act is a federal law that was passed in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to limit federal agencies or its employees from interfering with political activities or federally funded programs. 
This means federal employees can¡¯t hold fund-raisers for politicians or receive donations, but they can vote for or against candidates running in an election, the law states. 
Reid ended the letter reminding the director that he used to be a supporter of Comey¡¯s ¨C even when Republicans filibustered his nomination as FBI chief: ¡°I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant,¡± Reid concluded. ¡°With the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong.¡± 
In all actuality, Comey told Congress that even though he wasn¡¯t ¡°closing the case¡± in the FBI probe of Hillary¡¯s emails, he was still ending the investigation. 
Ironically can you imagine if he hadn¡¯t sent the letter? With the recent revelations, had he not sent a letter to Congress, he would have been blamed for attempting to lie to Congress and cover-up further investigation. As it stands, by sending the letter, he is simply accused of partisanship by sending the letter. 
I¡¯d say he¡¯s damned if he does and damned if he doesn¡¯t. 
I little suspicion that Comey has a backbone MUCH stronger than Harry Reid or any of his spineless Democratic accusers now. 
What an act of desperation on the Democrats part. Hillary is doing nothing but grasping at straws, whether or not anything comes of this new investigation before the election, we¡¯ll see, but to actually accuse Comey of treason, is utter idiocy.

President Barack Obama wants people in North Carolina to vote for Hillary Clinton, so he¡¯s warning them that Donald Trump would tolerate the support of the Klu Klux Klan if he¡¯s elected president. ¡°If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers ¡ª the Klan ¡ª and hesitate when asked about that support, then you¡¯ll tolerate that support when you¡¯re in office,¡± he said.

¡°[Y]ou threaten to throw your opponent in jail without any due process ¡­ then imagine what you¡¯ll do when you actually have the power to violate the Constitution along those lines,¡± Obama warned. 
Obama made his remarks at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill on Wednesday, saying that the fate of the world rests on their shoulders. 
¡°I hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the Republic rests on your shoulders,¡± he said as the audience laughed. ¡°The fate of the world is teetering, and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction.¡± 
Obama dismissed all of the negative ads and bad news that hurt Hillary Clinton as ¡°noise¡± and ¡°distractions,¡± that they should put aside. 
¡°Every day is just hysteria and over-the-top coverage,¡± he said, admitting that even he was getting tired of politics. ¡°I understand the feeling, I promise you.¡± 
He argued that the choice for president was simple, because Trump was a con artist who was unfit and not ready to be president. 
¡°I mean, it¡¯s strange how, over time, what is crazy gets normalized,¡± Obama said, referring to the multiple controversial statements made by Trump during the campaign. 
¡°That is not the voice of America. That¡¯s not the better angels of our nature,¡± he said.

A Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton presidency is rather mind-boggling to many of us. At last check, there are over 300 million people in the United States, and we can't find anyone better than HRC and 'The Donald'? 
Sadly, we are watching the American presidential election devolve into a competition between the DNC and the GOP as to who can put forward the most corrupt, asinine, power hungry candidate possible. Although the race to the bottom is a voting conundrum for both sides, the extreme left has posited a unique argument that can help social conservatives when it comes to personal principles and the voting booth. 
In a world where biological sex is gleefully separated from gender identification, shouldn¡¯t it be acceptable that one might separate selecting a candidate from voting for him or her? Put another way: if having male genitalia doesn't necessarily make you male, then selecting someone for president doesn¡¯t necessarily mean that you voted for that person. Right? 
This type of disconnected reality is only fair if everyone can play the game. Wow - this is an existential moment! I feel better already. To quote The Kinks : ¡°Girls will be boys, and boys will be girls. It¡¯s a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world¡­¡± 
Thank you, transgender community, for helping me work through this ¡°mixed up, muddled up¡± election. Although I will select Donald Trump for President of the United States, I will not be voting for him. 
That¡¯s right. I¡¯m voting for three reasons and three reasons only: 
I¡¯m voting to curtail the Clintons' power. 
I¡¯m voting to curtail the Clintons' power. 
I¡¯m voting to curtail the Clintons' power. 
There you have it: three solid reasons for selecting Donald Trump without voting for him. It¡¯s time to be pragmatic. It¡¯s time to select a candidate who will create the greatest amount of disturbance within the system albeit with the least amount of power. 
Who might that be? Let¡¯s see: ¡° eeny, meeny, miny, moe , H-R-C has got to go! ¡± Really, people - how long are we going to elect the same old political hacks who have consolidated their power for decades? 
It is amazing that in a ¡°free¡± country we¡¯ve allowed the Clintons to run the DNC (and thus a fair portion of Washington, D.C.) for nearly 30 years! They have manipulated the system for their personal gain to the tune of $110 million! They are willing to sell our country to the nation or company that will pay the highest speaking fee . They lie, cheat, and steal their way to the top. 
Is this not problematic? Power - and the lack of - is the most important thing for the next president, yet the media isn¡¯t discussing it. 
Here¡¯s the most substantial difference between Donald Trump and HRC. If elected, Donald Trump would have a fraction of the power of HRC. For crying out loud: 2/3 of the GOP is already against him . Do you hear any major resistance rising up against HRC by DNC insiders? No. Progressives should wake up to the fact that if they vote for HRC, then they prove that their Occupy Wall Street, stick-it-to-the-man gig is a complete sham. 
Indeed, if progressives vote for HRC, then they¡¯re either quintessential hypocrites who couldn¡¯t care less about the American people or they¡¯re complete idiots being played like a drum by the powers that be in the DNC. 
Make no mistake about it. I¡¯ll select Trump¡¯s name for president, but I¡¯m not voting for him. Rather, I¡¯m voting to limit the power of the presidency; I¡¯m voting to stop HRC¡¯s quest to become the first Queen of America by wielding the power of her husband¡¯s former kingship. 
Wake up, America! We fought a revolution to prevent such a consolidation of power. I would like to think Americans are smart enough to stop the Clintons from gaining even more of it.

Each Republican presidential candidate had to pledge their support for the eventual GOP nominee when they filed their initial statement of intent to run and be placed on the ballot in the South Carolina primary, no matter what. But it remains unclear of what will happen for candidates who break that rule. 
When a candidate files to be on the ballot in South Carolina, they must write down their name and address before a signing below a paragraph that in part reads: 
¡°I hereby affirm that I generally believe in and intend to support the nominees and platform of the Republican Party in the November 8, 2016 general election...¡± 
But a handful of Republicans have opted out of that promise to endorse Donald Trump, including Ohio Governor John Kasich, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former New York Governor George Pataki and Sen. Lindsey Graham. In addition, businesswoman Carly Fiorina withdrew her previous endorsement of Trump. 
And if those candidates want to run again, they might face considerable hurdles in the Palmetto state, according to top Republican officials. 
South Carolina Republican Party chairman Matt Moore told Independent Journal Review that there are ¡°no definitive punishments related to South Carolina¡¯s pledge¡± but that any candidate who refuses to back the nominee ¡°does so at their own political peril,¡± adding: 
¡°The political consequences would be in the minds of the voters. I expect that anyone who runs in 2020 without supporting the nominee in 2016 will find themselves in difficult situation in South Carolina.¡± 
However, the party could impose restrictions on candidates who violate the pledge, if they want. Moore said that while the South Carolina GOP's executive committee certainly has the authority to impose penalties, they have yet to meet on the subject. 
More stern on the prospect of penalizing candidates who do not get on board with Trump was Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who said last month that the GOP is going to take a second look at how their members can launch presidential bids. 
¡°And if they¡¯re thinking they¡¯re going to run again someday, I think that we¡¯re going to evaluate the process,¡± Priebus said. ""And I don¡¯t think it¡¯s going to be that easy for them.¡± 
As to whether or not the GOP can bar individuals from running on their primary ballots, University of South Carolina associate professor Ben Means told Independent Journal Review that ¡°political parties have a fair amount of discretion to control rights of participation,¡± so it would not matter all that much that candidates breached the contract. 
The South Carolina GOP could alter their rules to block the candidates from running again or they could absolve the disloyal candidates in the event of a catastrophic Trump loss. Either way, an evaluation of ballot access is in store for the Republican Party come November 9th.

In case you missed the political advertisement for Obamacare, it was touted as the ¡°Affordable Care Act.¡± 
Here are Democrats hyping the program, which the Obamacare architect described as a pathway to single-payer : 
Not too long ago, another fan of single-payer healthcare was Donald Trump. But don't take our word for it, look no further than the unofficial Trump campaign arm Breitbart.com for evidence . As Trump said in September 2015: 
Scott Pelley: Universal health care. 
Donald Trump: I am going to take care of everybody. I don¡¯t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody¡¯s going to be taken care of much better than they¡¯re taken care of now. 
In 1999, Trump was perfectly clear , as reported by Newsmax: 
¡°I said I¡¯m conservative, generally speaking, I¡¯m conservative, and even very conservative,¡± Trump told King in response to a question about a ¡°patients' bill of rights,¡± reports BuzzFeed. 
¡°But I¡¯m quite liberal and getting much more liberal on healthcare and other things. I really say: What¡¯s the purpose of a country if you¡¯re not going to have defensive and healthcare?¡± he told King. ""If you can¡¯t take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it¡¯s all over. I mean, it¡¯s no good. 
¡°So I¡¯m very liberal when it comes to healthcare. I believe in universal healthcare. I believe in whatever it takes to make people well and better.¡± 
After Obamacare passed, Trump sat down for an interview on HLN. This is what he had to say, as noted by The Washington Examiner: 
¡°Number one, as a human being, I like to see people ¡ª it's inconceivable that, you know, people are sick, like you get sick, or I get sick, or the kids get sick, and you bring 'em to a doctor, inconceivable that, you know, 31 or 33 million people can't do that,¡± Trump told host Joy Behar. ¡°So on one level, I think something had to be done.¡± 
Trump continued, saying the law is ¡°really going to cost a lot of money in terms of competitiveness with this country¡± and said it would cost a friend's company ¡°over $200 million a year.¡± 
Here is what Trump recently tweeted: Obamacare is a disaster - as I've been saying from the beginning. Time to repeal & replace! #ObamacareFail pic.twitter.com/5CvoMbVceT ¡ª Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2016 
Did Trump say it was a ¡°disaster from the beginning,¡± or ¡°on one level, I think something had to be done¡±? 
Perhaps, we turn to another tweet he had, drawing on the popular hashtag #ObamaCareInThreeWords: REPEAL AND REPLACE!!! #ObamaCareInThreeWords ¡ª Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2016 
It turns out that Donald Trump is a fan of ¡°repeal and replace,¡± but his political track record before he ran for president as a Republican shows that what he means by that is ¡°single-payer¡±¡ªthe goal of the Obamacare architect all along. 
When it comes to Trump's solution for Obamacare¡ªmaking it more competitive for insurance companies¡ªthis runs antithetical to the goal of single-payer, which is the government (i.e. taxpayers) paying for everyone. 
One can draw their own conclusions about what Trump actually means right now, because no one can be one hundred percent sure. Yet for a man who styled himself as an outsider and not at all like a ¡°politician,¡± his statements on Obamacare show himself very much to be similar to one.

During the third and final presidential debate, Donald Trump gave a fairly graphic description of what happens during a partial-birth abortion. Hillary Clinton was quick to say that ¡ª basically ¡ª Trump was full of it, and that procedure ¡°isn't what happens at all.¡± 
But the National Right to Life describes the procedure in vivid detail: 
Partial-Birth Abortion is a procedure in which the abortionist pulls a living baby feet-first out of the womb and into the birth canal (vagina), except for the head, which the abortionist purposely keeps lodged just inside the cervix (the opening to the womb). The abortionist punctures the base of the baby¡¯s skull with a surgical instrument, such as a long surgical scissors or a pointed hollow metal tube called a trochar. He then inserts a catheter (tube) into the wound, and removes the baby's brain with a powerful suction machine. This causes the skull to collapse, after which the abortionist completes the delivery of the now-dead baby. 
And the exact same procedure was detailed in the 1996 ban on partial-birth abortion that was vetoed by Bill Clinton. A similar ban was later passed again by Congress, and was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2003. 
Following the debate, in defense of Hillary Clinton, late-night host Samantha Bee (¡°Full Frontal with Samantha Bee¡±) doubled down on Clinton's position, saying that partial-birth abortion ¡°isn't a thing¡±: Image Credit: YouTube 
But just a few seconds later, she offers a back-handed admission that partial-birth abortion is a thing after all, it's just a thing that was banned in 2003: Image Credit: YouTube 
Bee went on to cheer Hillary for being the...: 
¡°...passionate and unapologetic feminist we haven't seen since the 90s. One who stood in a shower of sh*t and managed to do what 16 primary candidates and the GOP establishment couldn't: Namely, beat this d**k-waving, Berlusconi knock-off like a little bitch.¡± 
Enter radio host Steven Crowder (¡°Louder with Crowder¡±)... 
In a video response to Bee's post-debate diatribe, Crowder pointed out that not only does the procedure exist [warning: his descriptions are exceptionally graphic], but that Hillary Clinton did, in fact, vote against banning it in the Senate in 2003: 
Crowder deftly took on Bee's argument with a jab: 
¡°Oh, this is the part where we condemn white men for having an opinion on murder...¡± 
A cross: 
¡°A 'fatal birth defect.' Does that mean a baby who would be dead on arrival, or does it mean any baby that might have a disability and so the parents don't want to go through the trouble of raising that child?¡±

It appears as though Fox Business reporter Adam Shapiro felt the need to compare Trump and Hillary's crowd attendance, too. 
At a West Palm Beach rally Wednesday, Shapiro said there appeared to be roughly a thousand Hillary supporters at Palm Beach State College, which was a sizable difference to Trump's rally the day before: 
""It's nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford, Florida yesterday for Mr. Trump ¡ª 15,000.

Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took incoming fire on behalf of her boss about the candidate's treatment of reporters covering his campaign. 
Wolf Blitzer asked Conway to convince Trump not to ridicule reporters at his rallies, saying that they are ¡°scared¡± violence will go down: 
¡°He shouldn't be doing that. I mean, can you talk to him? And say to him, 'Mr. Trump, we only have a few days left, these are hardworking young journalists, they deserve to have some security,' if you will, because some of those Trump supporters out there, they get pretty nasty with what they're screaming at these young people.¡± Image Credit: Screenshot/CNN 
Conway said she would tell him. And then, she calmly withdrew her rhetorical scalpel, checked the glinting blade by the bright studio lights and carved out the reasons for Blitzer on why the reporters who cover the candidate deserve ridicule. 
She mentioned the WikiLeaks email which showed reporters had sought approval for stories from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta: 
""...[T]hat's not journalism, that's advocacy and, frankly, that's collusion. So if there's any spectrum between coziness to collaboration to collusion¡ªany of that would bother us. 
Many journalists have admitted that Donald Trump has compelled them to suspend objective standards of journalism. I think Americans deserve to have the race covered fairly."" 
Blitzer interrupted to mention the scared young reporters who might be harmed by Trump supporters. 
Conway said: 
¡°[T]he only violence I saw at rallies so far was what we saw on video tape by somebody whose cohorts were at the White House 346 times, actively paying people¡ª$1,500 a pop¡ªto be protesters to incite violence at Trump rallies. That's being done by Democratic operatives. The stink goes all the way up the chain through the DNC and related groups to Hillary Clinton's campaign.

Then Conway asked Blitzer a final, rhetorical question about the coverage of the campaign: 
¡°I wonder if the way the news is being covered in this election cycle, particularly in the last few weeks, is the way Americans actually see the news and see the race? It's not clear to me that they're being told is what they think is important to them is what is being reported to them.¡± 
Conway claimed that what people at Trump rallies are concerned with are jobs, ObamaCare and defeating ISIS, not necessarily what's being reported.

You've all heard by now that Donald Trump thinks Hillary Clinton is trying to rig the campaign, including the idea that she's trying to suppress his voters. 
Now Bloomberg Businessweek has a major new story out on his campaign, including a few fascinating revelations: 
¡°Nate Silver¡¯s results have been similar to ours....except they lag by a week or two because he¡¯s relying on public polls.¡± 
The campaign holds rallies in non-traditional states like New Hampshire and Maine because data shows that's where the most persuadable voters can be found. 
You meet Brad Parscale, Trump's main digital guy, who has quite a background. Join me on @thedonaldreddit Reddit AMA right now! https://t.co/tpyfSB0M75 ¡ª Brad Parscale (@parscale) October 25, 2016 
Most importantly, the story also presents another side of the Trump campaign, an active effort to persuade Democrats not to vote. It concentrates on three key groups. 1) White Liberals 
Trump¡¯s invocation at the debate of Clinton¡¯s WikiLeaks e-mails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. 2) Young Women 
The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. 3) African-Americans 
Her 1996 suggestion that some African American males are ¡°super predators¡± is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls¡ªparticularly in Florida. 
That strategy in action: 
On Oct. 24, Trump¡¯s team began placing spots on select African American radio stations. In San Antonio, a young staffer showed off a South Park-style animation he¡¯d created of Clinton delivering the ¡°super predator¡± line (using audio from her original 1996 sound bite), as cartoon text popped up around her: ¡°Hillary Thinks African Americans are Super Predators.¡± 
The animation will be delivered to certain African American voters through Facebook ¡°dark posts¡±¡ªnonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that, as Parscale puts it, ¡°only the people we want to see it, see it.¡± The aim is to depress Clinton¡¯s vote total. ¡°We know because we¡¯ve modeled this,¡± says the official. ¡°It will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out.¡± 
Early voting shows that the efforts to decrease turnout may not be working according to the Trump campaign's plan, but it's rare for a campaign to so openly boast of an effort to get people not to vote.

The strangest presidential election campaign in modern history continues. 
And the old saying ¡°politics makes strange bedfellows¡± was never more true than in this almost surrealistic example: conservative firebrand Sean Hannity praising uber-liberal filmmaker Michael Moore for praising Donald Trump¡ªsort of, anyway. 
During Hannity's radio show on Wednesday, Hannity said of Moore : 
¡°He realizes that there is a whole generation of people now, hard working, tax-paying long-suffering Americans, who have been keeping the country going through the hardest times ¡ª the people that built this country that are screwed over."" 
Hannity was referring to observations Moore makes in his recently released film ¡°Michael Moore in TrumpLand,¡± particularly about comments Moore said Trump made to Ford executives during a meeting of the Detroit Economics Club: 
""'If you close these factories like you're planning to do in Detroit, and build them in Mexico, I'm going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when send them back, and nobody's going to buy them.' 
It was an amazing thing to see. No politician ¡ª Republican or Democrat ¡ª had ever said anything like that to these executives."" 
Lest you think Moore has 'lost his mind' and gone over to 'the dark side,' think again.

During much of his 2016 presidential run, Donald Trump has struggled to gain the support of the black community. 
Even in September, an ABC News/Washington Post poll found that ¡°just 3 percent of blacks support Trump,¡± while 93% backed Hillary Clinton. 
In recent months, however, one unexpected figure has stepped up his efforts to change all that: iconic civil rights figure, Clarence Henderson.

During the 1960s, Henderson's name became a symbol of the fight to end segregation, when he participated in the peaceful sit-in at the Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. 
To be sure, supporting Republicans is nothing new for Henderson, as he credits them as the party ¡°behind the constitutional amendments that abolished slavery, granted equal protection to freed slaves and gave blacks the right to vote.¡± 
Henderson explained to The Associated Press that the first time he voted for a Republican presidential candidate was with George W. Bush, and he plans to continue his support for the GOP this year.

As to why he specifically supports Trump, Henderson has said he believes that ¡°America is a business,¡± and that Trump has the experience to run it: 
""He has proved to be a leader in the business field. Has he done everything right? No, certainly not. 
But I think that he has more at stake than Hillary does."" 
It's a stance Henderson expounded on during a CNN interview in August: 
When asked by CNN¡¯s Jim Sciutto how he could reconcile his civil rights background with Trump's ¡° ties to folks who have said and propagated some racist things,¡± Henderson responded : 
""See I come from an era of time known as 'Jim Crow,' and I know what racism is and what racism isn't... 
I'm not looking to like Donald Trump, I'm looking at what he will do. 
I look at the history of the Republican party versus the history of the Democratic party, and for the last eight years we have been put in dire straights because the policies that have been put in place such as Obamacare... 
We need jobs as opposed to things that are happening right now."" 
Though Henderson has faced criticism for his support of Trump, he says he doesn't mind, as he'd ¡°rather be in the minority on the side of justice than in the majority on the side of injustice.¡± 
Whether or not it's because of the support of men like Henderson, though, Trump has seen a sharp rise in his support among black voters.

He said his intention was to sell pieces of the star to raise money for the women who have accused Trump of sexual wrongdoing. None of the women have provided concrete proof of their claims.

He rolled out the plan wrapped in three promises . 
¡°I want to talk about how to grow the African American middle class and to provide a new deal for black America. That deal is grounded in three promises ¡ª safe communities, great education, and high paying jobs.¡± 
Of those promises, he said, in part:

""Making our communities safe again will be a priority. You walk to the store to buy a loaf of bread maybe with your child and you get shot. We got to stop it. 
[T]he law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice. We will also police our streets¡ªhave to keep our streets safe. 
The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police. We need really a great group of people to keep you safe, to keep us all safe."" 
2. Education 
""School choice is at the center of my plan. And by the way we¡¯re going to terminate common core and bring education local. 
My proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice."" 
3. Jobs 
""When we stop off-shoring to low wage countries, we raise wages at home meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable. 
I will also propose tax holidays for inner city investments, a new tax incentive to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods. 
I will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities."" 
Trump has repeatedly asked America's blacks ¡°what do you have to lose?¡± On Wednesday, he once again explained why minorities should reject Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. 
¡°We keep electing the same people over and over and over and they keep coming back to the African American community and the Hispanic community and they keep talking about what they¡¯re going to do and they don¡¯t do it and four years later you see them again.¡±

With just 12 days until Election Day, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and wife, Melania, sat down to discuss the campaign's ¡°best and worst moments¡± on ¡°Good Morning America.¡± 
Journalist George Stephanopoulos began by asking Melania if she's still confident in her husband winning the race to the White House: 
¡°I see the connection with the American people and my husband, and he created a movement. The crowd and the people that are behind him are unbelievable to see.¡± 
But when Stephanopoulos questioned whether she'd physically get out there on the campaign trail and stump for Trump, she wasn't as confident: 
¡°We will see. My priority is my son Barron and I support [my husband] 100% and I¡¯m there for him every time he needs me.¡± 
Trump was quick to interject, saying Melania would actually give two or three speeches soon, something that seemed to be news to Melania: Image Credit: Screenshot/ ABC News 
Trump explained that her speeches would be ¡°big¡± and ¡°important¡±: 
¡°She¡¯s amazing when she speaks. She is an amazing public speaker. She¡¯s agreed to do two or three speeches, and I think it¡¯s going to be big speeches, important speeches.¡± 
It's understandable if Melania isn't eager to give speeches on the campaign trail, given what happened at the Republican National Convention in July. 
Trump's wife was publicly ripped apart after journalist Jarrett Hill pointed out the similarities between her speech and Michelle Obama's in 2008. 
Though a side-by-side video comparison showed how certain passages were identical, Melania said she wrote the speech herself...with a little help from Hillary Clinton's former speechwriter. 
Despite the controversy, however, many commended her speech as ¡°beautiful¡± and given ¡°with tremendous poise¡±¡ª reflecting skills Trump's campaign may benefit from in these next two weeks.

By Peter Koenig
 "" PIPR "" - Imagine, Donald Trump would accede to the US Presidency, an unlikely event with the presstitute media relentlessly slamming, slashing and demonizing him, not unlike they do with President Putin ? while cheering no-end for the warmonger Killary, no matter what atrocities she has on her hands and body, no matter that blood is dripping out of her mouth every time she opens it ? like Iraq, Libya, Syria, Palestine, Afghanistan, Sudan ? and more, much more. They, the elite, the military-security complex, the financial mafia, want more blood, more than is already covering the entire current Obama Administration?s structure of psychopaths. Blood is weapons, blood is money, blood is more profit, blood is good for business ? so said the Washington Post, just slightly translated from ?war is good for business?. The warmongering MSM (mainstream media) also propagate for more weapons to enrich the military-security complex that pays them. But just for a moment, let?s assume, Trump would get elected with such a large margin that voter fraud would be difficult to manage.
Trump is sending a different narrative from that of eternal war. Trump seems to be looking into a different direction. He essentially says ? stop the conflict with Russia, make Russia a partner, stop outsourcing jobs, bring them back, give labor back to Americans, slash the unemployment rate ? which is, of course, everybody knows, way above the silly fabricated 5%. The reality is that unreported but real unemployment in the US is hovering between 22% and 25%, a real hammer for the economy, increasing anger and unhappiness and crime. Trump also says in the same vein as bringing back jobs ? STOP globalization, restrain NATO, rein in the banks ? yes, Wall Street, the Goldman Sachs-es and Co. of this world of fake pyramid money, dominated by the Rothschild-Rockefeller-Morgan clan. Trump says, let?s have a financial system that works for the people.
Does he mean it? ? I don?t know. Could be true. Most of what he says makes sense for America, for Americans ? and by extension for much of the rest of the world, especially Europe, the genuine Europe, not the puppet-commandeered Europe. He also says a lot of outright discriminatory and xenophobic rubbish ? like building a wall separating Mexico from the US of A, emulating Israel; and propagates a crackdown on Moslems. Does he mean it? Or does he want to please potential voters? ? Such statements are indeed dangerous rubbish, but they are secondary to all the other things that are PRIORITARY, as they would help restore American society, workforce, dignity ? most important: DIGNITY. Dignity is important for Americans to wake up to realize that they are living in a country that wastes their money, the peoples? resources ? on countless criminal wars around the world, feverishly racing towards Full Spectrum Dominance to benefit a few. The secondary stuff is important too, but can be dealt with in parallel by Americans that have come to senses.
Trump is in many ways like France?s Marine LePen, representing the extreme right, and therefore, no matter what sensible things she says and has on her agenda to do ? and I don?t doubt one minute that she means what she says ? like EUREXIT and send NATO to hell ? she is still framed by the ?left intellectuals? ? if such a thing still exists in our neoliberal universe ? as a discriminatory xenophobe who would expel all ?colored? and ?veiled? foreigners. Of course, that?s bad. But let her first initiating France exiting from the EU, the Euro and NATO ? the likely salvation of Europe, then tackle the other issues. First comes first. A true intellectual left would have to understand that ? and not bend to the presstitute promoted clich¨¦s.
Trump has enough money power. He doesn?t have to bend to the military security complex, to the banks, to the Obamacare pharma-fiefdom. He doesn?t really have to bend to anybody. That worries the elite. He is independent. Let?s give him the benefit of the doubt. In no case could he be worse than Hillary ? the killer ? so much can be read from every word she says. Her pattern of pathology ? ?We came, we saw, we won? , when she saw the bloodstained image of the NATO-slaughtered Ghaddafi ? indicates that she would not stop from pressing this infamous Red Button of Death and total world annihilation ? perhaps even repeating that same smirk, , ?We came, we saw, we won? .
Now let?s go to the next hypothesis, assuming Trump would be elected and ?they? ? the elusive high-powered small elite that pulls the strings on Washington and the White House?s overseas puppets, and let?s assume ?they? would let him live, at least for a while, Trump might be doing ?irrational? things in the eye of the Beltway slaves. Recognizing the perils for his own country and those for his neighbor, Canada, Mr. Trump might call on the western stooges, in Europe particularly, who for the sake of brown-nosing the naked king in Washington, are prepared to sell-out 500-plus million European and their future generations to the most nefarious trade deals the world has ever known ? CETA, TTIP and TiSA (let alone the TPP, where 12 Pacific countries are about to kiss ass in Washington) ? telling them to come to senses, think democracy and stop the deals that 80% or more of Europeans despise and reject.
As a parenthesis and philosophically speaking, one could say that given the hundreds of years of colonization around the globe, of shameless exploitation, of raping and killing millions of people throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America, that these trade ?deals? are Europe?s historically deserved heritage.
??
The Saker wrote a great essay on the aberration of this upcoming election and what might follow after the election, ?The US Is About To Face The Worst Crisis in Their History? ? http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article45729.htm . One of the article?s commenters pinned it down to the point: ? If Trump does become Commander in Chief, his first job will be securing his life. Those who really run the show in the US will stop at nothing to safeguard their empire. Truly the US is at a cross roads and by extension the world. Times are really scary .?
What Trump says he would do during his first 100 days in office, he presented in a groundbreaking speech at Gettysburg, Pa. this past weekend, is for the most part truly astounding http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2016/10/24/donald-trump-delivers-a-powerful-policy-speech-on-his-first-100-days-in-office/ . It is not less than revolutionary, because no US politician, let alone a Presidential candidate or President has said something for the most part so sensible as did Presidential candidate Trump. Summarizing, he promises bringing back overseas jobs, would prevent the continued outsourcing of the American production processes, bring order to the crime-ridden communities, he would seek friendly partnership with Russia, defusing the WWIII threat ? and he would tackle, restrain and control the corrupt banking system, including the endless money-making machine, the privately owned, Rothschild dominated FED. ? That is a challenge other Presidents have failed to master, including Lincoln and JFK. We know how they ended.
Trump has already hinted that to revive the American economy the zero-interest policy may have to be changed, so that banks become more responsible. The owners off the system would hardly allow Trump?s interference in their obscene profit-making scheme. They?d rather at their calling let the bomb loose. A sudden change of this policy would hit many over-stretched banks like a bombshell ? reminiscent of 2008 Lehman Brothers, just magnified by a factor of 10. There are currently at least three, possibly five Wall Street giants that are on the edge. They get by, because of the FED?s zero interest policy- and they make sure that this doesn?t change, as several if not all of them are part of the private FED system. Would Trump dare touching this system? ? It?s a deadly challenge. He knows it.
This time there may be more at stake then just another banking collapse, a planned emulation of the 2007 / 2008 crisis, where Wall Street was copiously rewarded for its excesses by tax-money bail-outs. Be aware, this time it would not be tax-payer?s money that would rescue the Too-Big-To Fail (TBTF) banks, but it would be YOUR money, your deposits, your savings, your pension funds, possibly even your shares if you have any in the bank being ?collapsed? ? and the process would be called ?bail-ins?.
The (western) world is under the hegemon of a privately-owned money system, the US-dollar ? and most people don?t even know it. The accent is on the western world , because the east, comprising Russia, China, the SCO countries (Shanghai Cooperation Organization ? comprising China and Russia and most of the Central Asian former Soviet Republics, plus Iran and Pakistan ? and others are waiting in the wings), the EEU (Eurasian Economic Union), as well as most of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), are forming their own eastern economic and monetary block. ? I have said this before, but will repeat it for readers to realize ? this ?economic block? ? is largely, if not entirely, delinked from the dollar scheme. It consists of about half the world?s population and one third of the world?s GDP, a solid GDP that is. In contrast to the western, especially the US GDP; in the eastern block much of the GDP is based on real labor output and manufacturing.
In reality, this eastern economic power block which is also displaying the world?s largest economic development potential, since history remembers, the New Silk Road ? or the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) economic development scheme, stretching from Vladivostok to Lisbon (if Europe chooses to participate), does not need the west anymore. The OBOR project has already begun. It represents a view into the future, with job opportunities and the outlook for a truly better life for hundreds of millions, possibly billions of people during coming generations ? a dynamic vision for the future. The east is where the future lays.
??-
Donald Trump as President notwithstanding, a new western well-planned banking collapse may start in the US, the ramifications and impact would be felt around the globe ? sinking millions, hundreds of millions of people into poverty, misery, the like we haven?t seen in recent history. The banks ?depositors? money might not be enough. The reptiles are hungry. They might privatize public properties, infrastructures, roads, ports railways, health care, education, pensions, natural resources ? anything that is still in the hands of the people. If Greece is a reminder, then think of Greece blown up by a factor of 1000 ? all around the globe, touching in extremis the vulnerable people of the vulnerable countries ? billions of people. While the money flows again from the poor to the rich, to an ever-shrinking pool of super-rich; widening the rich-poor gap to a disgusting yawn. Leaving the 99.99 % ? by now the 99. % ever more powerless, having to fend for sheer survival ? seeking refuge in ?better lands? ? It?s a war by money. Canons, bombs and guns could rest ? for a while.
For years, I have felt the Empire will have to be brought down from inside ? from the people who can?t take it anymore, from an internal revolt that eventually would break the worldwide extended monster?s back. Rome and most subsequent empires have fallen this way. It may still happen. But now I side more with The Saker?s theory, namely that the defeat may come from a combination of inside revolt and outside forces, not so much military forces, but economic forces. In theory, it could happen tomorrow. Just imagine, the one third of world-GDP-countries would drop all their dollar reserves, all the dollar denominated international contracts, all dollar issued trade agreements ? and in particular, abandon at once the unwritten rule of hydrocarbons to be traded only in US-dollars. It would most likely wipe out the western economy.
This will not happen, of course. Simply, because the One Third GDP holders do not want to destroy the economy of the rest of the world, especially the so-called developing and emerging countries, many ? or most of them ? eventually to become allies of this eastern block that promises peaceful co-existence rather than the current western pattern of ever multiplying wars and conflicts ? a sheer dollar-fed killing spree, with destruction and weapons manufacturing no end.
The Power of Money. Would Donald Trump, as President, himself a moneyed powerhouse, survive such a calamity? In fact, would he be able and strong enough to veer the ship around, guiding the world away from such destructive scenarios and towards peace and cooperation between East and West? ? Or is the train already too far out of the station? ? No telling at this time. The signals are certainly not good. But, let?s put in a grain of optimism and ?bank? on a positive strand of dynamics fueled by an increasing human consciousness ? one that would not allow Hillary to push the Death Button.

Take it from a Brit, right-wing populism will thrive until you deal with it genuinely.
By Gary Younge October 31, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" The Nation "" - A I ?ve been living in Britain for the last year and have returned to the United States to cover the election from a small town in Indiana?with the experience of Brexit on my mind.
On June 24, a significant proportion of the British electorate woke up and thought they were living in a different country. Britain narrowly voted to leave the European Union. It felt like the politics of fear, isolation, and xenophobia had delivered an utterly devastating and enduring blow to the body politic. There are many lessons from that night, and indeed we in Britain are only just beginning to learn them. But as it relates to the American elections, I want to dwell on just three.
The fact that the messenger is deranged doesn?t mean the message itself contains no significant truths.
First, don?t let the polls guide your strategic decisions about voting. If you want Hillary Clinton to win, vote for her. If you favor Jill Stein, vote for her. Don?t cast your vote thinking you?re compensating for a result that has not been declared but that you think you?ve factored in. You don?t know.
The Brexit result caught the currency traders, pollsters, betting agencies, and commentators off guard. One of the leading voices of the Leave campaign, Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party, conceded defeat at 10 pm the night of the election; less than six hours later he claimed victory.
As I write, polls suggest a runaway victory for Clinton. They could be right. But politics is in a very volatile state?they could also be wrong. And the only way you?ll know for sure will be when it?s too late to do anything about it.
Second, the fact that the messenger is deranged doesn?t mean the message itself contains no significant truths. Before the Brexit referendum, liberals broadly dismissed Leave voters as ignorant, angry, and bigoted. Some of them were undoubtedly all three. But that?s not primarily what was driving many of them. It took the Brexit result for the nation to pay attention to communities devastated by neoliberal globalization. Had Remain won, those who were forgotten would have remained forgotten.
True, politicians have drawn mostly the wrong conclusions: condemning the free movement of people rather than the free movement of capital. Nonetheless, regions long ignored, accents rarely heard, and issues seldom raised are traveling from the margins to the mainstream of British politics.
Similarly, if Hillary Clinton wins, that should not blind us to some of the themes that have made Trump?s candidacy viable. In Muncie, Indiana, where I have spent most of this election season, huge manufacturing plants have closed since the passage of NAFTA, leaving one-third of the town in poverty. And while Trump?s base is not particularly poor, a significant portion of the nation is desperate. It?s not difficult to see why. The price of everything apart from labor has shot up in the past 40 years, while inequality has grown and social mobility has slumped. Trump?s original Brexit strategy of targeting Rust Belt towns in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin may not have worked electorally, but what he identified remains a politically salient fault line that doesn?t just go away if Clinton wins. If these problems are not tended to, a less erratic and more focused right-wing populist than Trump could easily exploit them.
Which brings us to the third lesson. Trump is deluded about many things, but he?s right to insist that the media and political classes are out of touch with the population. They exist in a fetid ideological comfort zone where radical change is considered apostasy at precisely the moment when radical change is both necessary and popular.
Leading up to the Brexit vote, leaders of the Remain campaign preferred to caricature those in the opposing camp rather than engage them. They de-rided not only the leaders of the Leave campaign but its followers. You cannot convince people they are doing well when they are not. Yet throughout the Brexit campaign, Remain advocates lectured voters on all the advantages they derived from the European Union and how much worse things would be if they left. From Tony Blair to David Cameron, people who had stiffed working people in a range of ways now insisted they alone could save them from themselves. People just weren?t buying it.
Similarly, people in Muncie and elsewhere are aware that some of the worst things to come out of Washington?-including NAFTA, financial deregulation, and the Iraq War?were bipartisan efforts in which the mainstream media acted as cheerleaders. That is why, I assume, Delaware County, where Muncie resides, voted for both Trump and Bernie Sanders in the primaries. When Democrats wheel out high-ranking Republicans who now disown Trump, they don?t realize they are making Trump?s point for him: The establishment that has done nothing for you hates me?I must be doing something right .
Brexit and the US elections are not synonymous. But there is plenty of overlap in the nationalist nostalgia, xenophobia, political dislocation, and class grievance that they draw upon.
Time and again in Muncie, Trump supporters, some of whom voted for Obama, say they really just want to ?shake things up.? They are not alone. ?The Democratic establishment is very, very happy with incremental change,? says Dave Ring, who backed Bernie and runs an organic farm and food store in Muncie called the Downtown Farm Stand. ?And the rest of the public is out here like, ?We don?t have time for incremental change. We don?t have time for that. Why would we want to wait???
This sense of urgency will not go away if Hillary wins, any more than a Remain vote would have signaled that all was well with British society. We didn?t wake up in a different country on June 24; it was simply a country we had ceased to recognize. A defeat for Trump, regardless of its magnitude, should not be misunderstood as an endorsement of the status quo. Just because you haven?t descended into the abyss, as Britain did, doesn?t mean you?re not standing dangerously close to its edge.

By Darren Boyle
 "" Daily Mail "" - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has claimed Donald Trump 'won't be allowed to win' next week's election during an interview to be broadcast on a pro-Kremlin TV station.
The Australian computer hacker was speaking from inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he also accused Hillary Clinton of receiving donations from the same people funding ISIS .
Assange said he was basing his claims on emails released last month by WikiLeaks.
Speaking to Australian journalist John Pilger for Dartmouth Films, Assange claimed one of the leaked documents between showed a message sent by the then Secretary of State to John Podesta, who was an adviser to President Barack Obama.
Assange said the email urged Obama to 'bring pressure' on the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, 'which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups'.
He described the email as the 'most important' in the entire collection.
He claimed: 'All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some ?rogue? princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.'
Clinton has also been criticized over claims that the Clinton Foundation receives funding from Saudi and Qatari sources.
Later in the 25-minute interview, which will be broadcast on Russia Today, Assange claims next Tuesday's presidential election has been fixed in favour of Hillary Clinton.
He added: 'My analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment. Banks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves.'
Donald Trump has repeatedly said Tuesday's presidential election may be rigged, while providing scant evidence, and has urged supporters to keep an eye out for signs of voting fraud in Philadelphia and other heavily Democratic areas.
Democrats worry that could encourage Trump supporters to harass minority voters in a state that could determine whether Trump or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, wins the presidency. Voting-rights advocates said they are already receiving reports of harassment.
Democrats have launched a legal blitz of their own in an attempt to shut down Trump's poll-watching efforts in Pennsylvania and three other battleground states, arguing in lawsuits that Republican monitoring efforts amount to 'vigilante voter intimidation' that violates federal law.
Assange earlier denied he was a stooge for the Russian intelligence services, claiming they were not behind the damaging leaks to the Clinton campaign.
He has been wanted by Swedish authorities since 2010 over rape allegations.
He has been hiding the the Ecuadorian embassy in London over fears he will be extradited to the United States.
He said: 'The Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything.
'Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That's false ? we can say that the Russian government is not the source.'
The first tranche of emails published by WikiLeaks claimed the Democratic party leadership actively favored Clinton over her rival for the nomination Bernie Sanders.
The Department of Homeland Security Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said last month they were 'confident' the Russian government was responsible for the leaks.
But Russia has denied this and presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov said it was 'nonsense'.
In an interview with veteran John Pilger on RT, Assange said: 'We have independently authenticated the emails. WikiLeaks has a decade-long, perfect record in the accurate authentication of leaked documents.'

She a vindictive dictator, punishing her enemies, appointing neocons
Well, both Hillary and Donald Trump say the election is about the lesser evil. So, if that?s true, who?s the greater evil? Posted November 08, 2016
Ross Ashcroft: You?ve got two candidates in the U.S. and one is very pro-Wall Street, specifically Goldman Sachs. She might as well be on the payroll. In fact, she is on the payroll. And the other is a rent-seeker -in-chief, and he?s built real estate and used the banks. So you?ve got Trump and you?ve got Clinton. Both of them are in bed with Wall Street, fundamentally. But the people get it now.
Michael Hudson: Well, I think Hillary Clinton has a 79 percent disapproval rating, and Trump has an 81 percent disapproval rating. So you have the two most unpopular politicians in the United States as the choice. So basically, the voters in the United States are given a choice: ?Yes,???Yes, please,? and ?Yes, thank you.? I think Trump missed his big chance to make a populist push. Instead of saying he?s going to cut taxes on Wall Street, he can say, ?Look, I stiffed the banks. I went bankrupt four or six times. I screwed the banks and they didn?t get paid and I can screw the banks for you people. Vote for me. I know how to do it.?
Ashcroft: Yes, he?s missed that.
Hudson: I think that would have been his winning ploy.
Ashcroft: You should be his campaign strategist.
Hudson: Well, except I don?t think I?d have many friends if I worked for Donald Trump. And we don?t know that if he agreed with me today what he?d do tomorrow. That?s part of the problem. He doesn?t play well with colleagues.
Ashcroft: You sort of prefer him though?would that be right? Because he doesn?t play well with colleagues, because he?s awkward, because he?s a loner, because?because you?re saying you don?t want a resourceful, intelligent and influential type in the job because the job?s so powerful.
Hudson: Well, both Hillary and Donald Trump say the election is about the lesser evil. So, if that?s true, who?s the greater evil? Hillary has a whole crowd behind her?the neocons, who basically want to be very confrontational toward Russia and continue what she was doing in Libya to Syria?militarily confrontational. Or you have Donald Trump, who doesn?t really know who he can appoint and whether he can get enough people to work with him. So if the direction of America is to try to hold on to a unipolar world?militarily confrontational?you want a president who is least able to do evil. And there?s no question, Trump is the lesser evil because he?s such a narcissist, and really sort of a blank slate. And I?d rather take a ?pig in a poke? than someone who?you already know what Hillary will do. She?ll do what the husband does. And it?s?the Clintons have corrupted the Democratic Party. That?s what Bernie Sanders ran on against her?
Ashcroft: And did very well.
Hudson: And did very well. But then he didn?t realize that there really cannot be any progress by the labor unions, or consumers, or the 99 percent as long as the Democratic Party is controlled totally by Wall Street and by the Robert Rubin gang that they brought in. And they?re really like a mafia gang. If you think the financial sector and the banking sector as crime?and after all, remember, they?ve paid billions and billions of dollars in civil fines without a single banker being sent to jail?that?s what a criminal wants to do. When the criminals take control of the justice system and take over the police force and bribe the judges?all the Hollywood movies in the 1930s were that?then you?ve got the criminals in control. And you?ve got the financial sector criminalized. That?s what my colleague Bill Black at the University of Missouri at Kansas City has been emphasizing, and he?s convinced all of us that the business plan of the big banks?Citibank, Bank of America, we?ve just got, and Wells Fargo, with all of the huge frauds that are coming out?that was their business plan: fraud. And people are afraid to say that fraud is banking. They?re afraid to say just exactly what the evidence is because it?s considered impolite to talk about reality.
Ashcroft: What sort of president then will Hillary Clinton be?
Hudson: A dictator. She a vindictive dictator, punishing her enemies, appointing neocons in the secretary of state, in the defense department, appointing Wall Street people in the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, and the class war will really break out very explicitly. And she?ll?as Warren Buffet said, there is a class war and we?re winning it.
Ashcroft: As in the one percent are winning it.
Hudson: The one percent are winning it. And she will try to use the rhetoric to tell people: ?Nothing to see here folks. Keep on moving,? while the economy goes down and down and she cashes in as she?s been doing all along, richer and richer, and if she?s president, there will not be an investigator of the criminal conflict of interest of the Bill Clinton Foundation, of pay-to-play. You?ll have a presidency in which corporations who pay the Clintons will be able to set policy. Whoever has the money to buy the politicians will buy control of policy because elections have been privatized and made part of the market economy in the United States. That?s what the Citizens United Supreme Court case was all about.
Ashcroft: So that?s another example of rent-seeking.
Hudson: Yes, political payoffs. And that?s the largest rent-seeking of all. Basically, for paying one penny, you get a whole dollar?s worth of special privileges. And rent is really payment for a privilege. It?s for a privilege that?s created from the private sector. And basically as Balzac said, every great fortune originates in a great theft that isn?t considered a great theft anymore because it?s all viewed as part of the market. It?s viewed as if that?s how the world works. So you?ll have a theft taking place and the Clintons will say, ?That?s just how the world operates and GDP is going up because we?re getting richer, enough to offset the degree by which you 99 percent are getting poor.?",english,2016-11-09T06:40:15.631+02:00,informationclearinghouse.info,US,82758,Trump is The Lesser Evil Because He?s Such a Narcissist      :,0.001,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Positive

She congratulated us ? it?s about us ? on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she ? she fought very hard.
Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.
(APPLAUSE)
I mean that very sincerely.
(APPLAUSE)
Now it?s time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.
(APPLAUSE)
It?s time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me.
(APPLAUSE)
For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people. . .
(LAUGHTER)
. . . I?m reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.
(APPLAUSE)
As I?ve said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their families.
(APPLAUSE)
It?s a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will.
(APPLAUSE)
Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I?ve spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country.
(APPLAUSE)
Tremendous potential. I?ve gotten to know our country so well ? tremendous potential. It?s going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
(APPLAUSE)
We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We?re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.
We will also finally take care of our great veterans.
(APPLAUSE)
They?ve been so loyal, and I?ve gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I?ve spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It?s going to happen.
(APPLAUSE)
We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be.
(APPLAUSE)
We?ll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great.
TRUMP: Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.
America will no longer settle for anything less than the best.
(APPLAUSE)
We must reclaim our country?s destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We?re going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again.
I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America?s interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone ? all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.
And now I?d like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory.
First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now.
(APPLAUSE)
Great people. I?ve learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents.
I also want to thank my sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And, where are they? They?re here someplace. They?re very shy, actually. And my brother Robert ? my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert?

And Lara, unbelievable job, unbelievable.
Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much.
What a great group. You?ve all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people.
And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got ? we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it?s been ? it?s been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani.

Great man.
Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up?
(LAUGHTER)
Is that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here.

TRUMP: That?s right. How did you possibly guess? So let me tell you about Reince, and I?ve said this. I said, Reince ? and I know it, I know. Look at all those people over there. I know it. Reince is a superstar. But I said, ?They can?t call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win,? because you can?t be called a superstar ? like Secretariat ? if Secretariat came in second, Secretariat would not have that big, beautiful bronze bust at the track at Belmont.
But I?ll tell you, Reince is really a star. And he is the hardest-working guy. And in a certain way, I did this ? Reince, come up here. Where is Reince? Get over here, Reince.
(APPLAUSE)
Boy oh boy oh boy. It?s about time you did this, Reince. My God.
(APPLAUSE)
Say a few words. No, come on, say something.
RNC CHAIRMAN REINCE PRIEBUS: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you. It?s been an honor. God bless. Thank God.
TRUMP: Amazing guy.
Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we?ve done.
So I also have to say I?ve gotten to know some incredible people ? the Secret Service people.
(APPLAUSE)
They?re tough and they?re smart and they?re sharp, and I don?t want to mess around with them, I can tell you. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down on the seat. But they are fantastic people, so I want to thank the Secret Service.
(APPLAUSE)
And law enforcement in New York City. They?re here tonight.
(APPLAUSE)
These are spectacular people, sometimes underappreciated unfortunately, but we appreciate them. We know what they go through.
So, it?s been what they call a historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job. And I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job.
(APPLAUSE)
I look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years, or maybe even eight years. . .
(APPLAUSE)
. . . you will say, so many of you worked so hard for us, but you will say that ? you will say that that was something that you really were very proud to do and I can. . .
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning.
(APPLAUSE)

Hillary Clinton?s stunning defeat reflected a gross misjudgment by the Democratic Party about the depth of populist anger against self-serving elites who have treated much of the country with disdain
By Robert Parry November 10, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" Consortium News "" - In the end, Hillary Clinton became the face of a corrupt, arrogant and out-of-touch Establishment, while Donald Trump emerged as an almost perfectly imperfect vessel for a populist fury that had bubbled beneath the surface of America.
There is clearly much to fear from a Trump presidency, especially coupled with continued Republican control of Congress. Trump and many Republicans have denied the reality of climate change; they favor more tax cuts for the rich; they want to deregulate Wall Street and other powerful industries ? all policies that helped create the current mess that the United States and much of the world are now in.
Further, Trump?s personality is problematic to say the least. He lacks the knowledge and the temperament that one would like to see in a President ? or even in a much less powerful public official. He appealed to racism, misogyny, white supremacy, bigotry toward immigrants and prejudice toward Muslims. He favors torture and wants a giant wall built across America?s southern border.
But American voters chose him in part because they felt they needed a blunt instrument to smash the Establishment that has ruled and mis-ruled America for at least the past several decades. It is an Establishment that not only has grabbed for itself almost all the new wealth that the country has produced but has casually sent the U.S. military into wars of choice, as if the lives of working-class soldiers are of little value.
On foreign policy, the Establishment had turned decision-making over to the neoconservatives and their liberal-interventionist sidekicks, a collection of haughty elitists who often subordinated American interests to those of Israel and Saudi Arabia, for political or financial advantage. The war choices of the neocon/liberal-hawk coalition have been disastrous ? from Iraq to Afghanistan to Libya to Syria to Ukraine ? yet this collection of know-it-alls never experiences accountability. The same people, including the media?s armchair warriors and the think-tank ?scholars,? bounce from one catastrophe to the next with no consequences for their fallacious ?group thinks.? Most recently, they have ginned up a new costly and dangerous Cold War with Russia.
For all his faults, Trump was one of the few major public figures who dared challenge the ?group thinks? on the current hot spots of Syria and Russia. In response, Clinton and many Democrats chose to engage in a crude McCarthyism with Clinton even baiting Trump as Vladimir Putin?s ?puppet? during the final presidential debate.
It is somewhat remarkable that those tactics failed; that Trump talked about cooperation with Russia, rather than confrontation, and won. Trump?s victory could mean that rather than escalating the New Cold War with Russia, there is the possibility of a ratcheting down of tensions.
Repudiating the Neocons
Thus, Trump?s victory marks a repudiation of the neocon/liberal-hawk orthodoxy because the New Cold War was largely incubated in neocon/liberal-hawk think tanks, brought to life by likeminded officials in the U.S. State Department, and nourished by propaganda across the mainstream Western media.
It was the West, not Russia, that provoked the confrontation over Ukraine by helping to install a fiercely anti-Russian regime on Russia?s borders. I know the mainstream Western media framed the story as ?Russian aggression? but that was always a gross distortion.
There were peaceful ways for settling the internal differences inside Ukraine without violating the democratic process, but U.S. neocons, such as Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, and wealthy neoliberals, such as financial speculator George Soros, pushed for a putsch that overthrew the elected President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014.
Putin?s response, including his acceptance of Crimea?s overwhelming referendum to return to Russia and his support for ethnic Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine opposing the coup regime in Kiev, was a reaction to the West?s destabilizing and violent actions. Putin was not the instigator of the troubles.
Similarly, in Syria, the West?s ?regime change? strategy, which dates back to neocon planning in the mid-1990s, involved collaboration with Al Qaeda and other Islamic jihadists to remove the secular government of Bashar al-Assad. Again, Official Washington and the mainstream media portrayed the conflict as all Assad?s fault, but that wasn?t the full picture.
From the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, U.S. ?allies,? including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Israel, have been aiding the rebellion, with Turkey and the Gulf states funneling money and weapons to Al Qaeda?s Nusra Front and even to the Al Qaeda spinoff, Islamic State.
Though President Barack Obama dragged his heels on the direct intervention advocated by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama eventually went in halfway, bending to political pressure by agreeing to train and arm so-called ?moderates? who ended up fighting next to Al Qaeda?s Nusra Front and other jihadists in Ahrar al-Sham.
Trump has been inarticulate and imprecise in describing what policies he would follow in Syria, besides suggesting that he would cooperate with the Russians in destroying Islamic State. But Trump didn?t seem to understand the role of Al Qaeda in controlling east Aleppo and other Syrian territory.
Uncharted Territory
So, the American voters have plunged the United States and the world into uncharted territory behind a President-elect who lacks a depth of knowledge on a wide variety of issues. Who will guide a President Trump becomes the most pressing issue today.
Will he rely on traditional Republicans who have done so much to mess up the country and the world or will he find some fresh-thinking realists who will realign policy with core American interests and values.
For this dangerous and uncertain moment, the Democratic Party establishment deserves a large share of the blame. Despite signs that 2016 would be a year for an anti-Establishment candidate ? possibly someone like Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders ? the Democratic leadership decided that it was ?Hillary?s turn.?
Alternatives like Warren were discouraged from running so there could be a Clinton ?coronation.? That left the 74-year-old socialist from Vermont as the only obstacle to Clinton?s nomination and it turned out that Sanders was a formidable challenger. But his candidacy was ultimately blocked by Democratic insiders, including the unelected ?super-delegates? who gave Clinton an early and seemingly insurmountable lead.
With blinders firmly in place, the Democrats yoked themselves to Clinton?s gilded carriage and tried to pull it all the way to the White House. But they ignored the fact that many Americans came to see Clinton as the personification of all that is wrong about the insular and corrupt world of Official Washington. And that has given us President-elect Trump.

November 10, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - The American electorate?s preference for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders has established two facts. One is that the majority of the American people do not believe the media presstitutes. The other is that only the ?progressives? and ?liberals? who inhabit the Atlantic Northeast and Pacific West coasts believe the presstitutes.
Trump?s election to the presidency has confirmed these holier-than-thou souls in their strongly held belief that America is a white trash racist country. They have told us this all day long today.
From these people and from the presstitutes we hear that white supremacy elected Trump. This is their propaganda, the intention of which is to discredit a Trump administration before it is inaugerated. Funny how white supremacy elected black Obama twice previously.
Truthout has lost it completely. John Knefel declares ?The David Dukes of the World Prevail.?
Kelly Hayes declares ?White Supremacy Elected Donald Trump.?
William Rivers Pitt declares ?We have elected a fascist that Mussolini would have recognized on sight.?
Hillary carried only a handful of states, the states that comprise the One Percent?s stomping grounds. Yet Amy Goodman of Democracy Now sees meaning in political writer John Nichols claim that as Hillary carried New York and California, she won the popular vote and should be in the White House. I remember a few days ago George Soros saying that Trump would win the popular vote, but that the electoral vote would go to Hillary, thus ridding the oligarchs of Trump.
Earth Justice promises to hold Trump accountable. Trump who promises to end the threat of nuclear war with Russia and China, thereby doing more to save animal and human life than the entirety of the Democratic Party and environmental organizations, is going to be held accountable by an organization that allegedly is beyond politics and is dedicated to preserving animals from destruction.
The ACLU, of which I am a member, has also put ?on notice? the president-elect who has said he will save us from nuclear war. Faced with this idiocy from the ACLU, I will not renew my membership.
Feminists tell us that we are ?grieving, scared, and in shock,? and that ?it is critical that we stand together and support each other.?
Jeremy Ben-Ami of the J Street Jewish Community tells us that it is ?an incredibly sad and difficult day. For tens of millions of Americans who share a core belief in tolerance, decency and social justice, the election results are a severe shock. In this challenging moment, we turn to one another for comfort and community. During this election, J Street made unequivocally clear our conviction that Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States.?
Van Jones, a CNN commentator, said that Trump?s election is a nightmare, ?a deeply painful moment,? a ?whitelash? against minorities. While he bemoaned the pain inflicted upon poor little presstitute Van Jones, he didn?t mind insulting the American electorate and the President-elect of the United States. After all, Van Jones sees that as his racist prerogative.
And so, the holier-than-thou crowd prefers Hillary, despite her unambigious position that she would maximize conflict with Russia and China, provoke direct military conflict between the US and Russia by imposing a no-fly zone in Syria, attack Iran and other of Israel?s targets, further enrich her Wall Street handlers by privatizing Social Security, and prevent any dissent from the lowly people class of her high-handed ways. If William Rivers Pitt sees Trump as a Mussolini fascist, Trump is too mild for Pitt. He prefers Hillary, a Hitler to the third power.
The progressives have totally discredited themselves just as the presstitutes have done. Their need for a bogyman to nourish their hysteria indicates serious psychological disturbance. They actually prefer the risk of Armageddon to peace among nuclear powers. As their 501(c)3s live off corporate contributions, they prefer globalist corporate profits to jobs for ordinary Americans.
These are the people who think of themselves as our instructors and our betters.
If only Trump could exile the lot of them. They are anti-American to the core.
The Working Class Won The Election
By Paul Craig Roberts
November 10, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - The US presidential election is historic, because the American people were able to defeat the oligarchs. Hillary Clinton, an agent for the Oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that the media and the political establishments of the political parties no longer have credibility with the American people.
It remains to be seen whether Trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore American jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with Russia, China, Syria, and Iran.
It also remains to be seen how the Oligarchy will respond to Trump?s victory. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve can cause an economic crisis in order to put Trump on the defensive, and they can use the crisis to force Trump to appoint one of their own as Secretary of the Treasury. Rogue agents in the CIA and Pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt friendly relations with Russia. Trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government.
With Trump there is at least hope. Unless Trump is obstructed by bad judgment in his appointments and by obstacles put in his way, we should expect an end to Washington?s orchestrated conflict with Russia, the removal of the US missiles on Russia?s border with Poland and Romania, the end of the conflict in Ukraine, and the end of Washington?s effort to overthrow the Syrian government. However, achievements such as these imply the defeat of the US Oligarchy. Although Trump defeated Hillary, the Oligarchy still exists and is still powerful.
Trump said that he no longer sees the point of NATO 25 years after the Soviet collapse. If he sticks to his view, it means a big political change in Washington?s EU vassals. The hostility toward Russia of the current EU and NATO officials would have to cease. German Chancellor Merkel would have to change her spots or be replaced. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg would have to be dismissed.
We do not know who Trump will select to serve in his government. It is likely that Trump is unfamiliar with the various possibilities and their positions on issues. It really depends on who is advising Trump and what advice they give him. Once we see his government, we will know whether we can be hopeful for the changes that now have a chance.
If the oligarchy is unable to control Trump and he is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military/security complex and in holding the financial sector politically accountable, Trump could be assassinated.
Trump said that he will put Hillary in prison. He should first put her on trial for treason and war crimes along with all of the neoconservatives. That would clear the decks for peace with the other two major nuclear powers over whom the neoconservatives seek hegemony. Although the neoconservatives would still have contacts in the hidden deep state, it would make it difficult for the vermin to organize false flag operations or an assassination. Rogue elements in the military/security complex could still bring off an assassination, but without neocons in the government a coverup would be more difficult.
Trump has more understanding and insight than his opponents realize. For a man such as Trump to risk acquiring so many powerful enemies and to risk his wealth and reputation, he had to have known that the people?s dissatisfaction with the ruling establishment meant he could be elected president.
We won?t know what to expect until we see who are the Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries. If it is the usual crowd, we will know Trump has been captured.
A happy lasting result of the election is the complete discrediting of the US media. The media predicted an easy Hillary victory and even Democratic Party control of the US Senate. Even more important to the media?s loss of influence and credibility, despite the vicious media attack on Trump throughout the presidential primaries and presidential campaign, the media had no effect outside the Northeast and West coasts, the stomping grounds of the One Percent. The rest of the country ignored the media.
I did not think the Oligarchy would allow Trump to win. However, it seems that the oligarchs were deceived by their own media propaganda. Assured that Hillary was the sure winner, they were unprepared to put into effect plans to steal the election.
Hillary is down, but not the Oligarchs. If Trump is advised to be conciliatory, to hold out his hand, and to take the establishment into his government, the American people will again be disappointed. In a country whose institutions have been so completely corrupted by the Oligarchy, it is difficult to achieve real change without bloodshed.

November 10, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" USA Today "" - After a stunning win that upended the American political landscape, President-elect Donald Trump and his top advisers now must put together a White House staff and Cabinet ? a group that may well include some of those same advisers.
Here are a few possibilities for some of the most powerful roles in a new Trump administration :
Rudy Giuliani The ex-New York City mayor became one of Trump's highest-profile surrogates. The former prosecutor could now be in line for attorney general.
Newt Gingrich The ex-House speaker became a top adviser and television spokesperson for Trump during the campaign and was even among the real estate mogul's finalists for running mate. He is said to be interested in becoming secretary of State.
Bob Corker The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee could also be a possibility to lead the State Department.
Ben Carson A onetime Trump rival, Carson emerged as one of Trump's most steadfast surrogates. The renowned physician would be an obvious candidate to be surgeon general.
Mike Flynn The retired general emerged as Trump's most visible military adviser. He could be in line for Defense secretary or some other national security position.
Jeff Sessions During the primary campaign, Sessions became the first sitting member of the U.S. Senate to endorse Trump's campaign. Now, the Alabama senator could be another possibility to lead the Pentagon.
Reince Priebus The chairman of the Republican National Committee ? which ran the Trump campaign's get-out-the-vote operation ? could wind up as Trump's White House chief of staff.
Steve Mnuchin Trump's finance chairman, formerly of Goldman Sachs, is in line to possibly become Treasury secretary.
Chris Christie Though shadowed by the recent Bridgegate trial, the New Jersey governor has been a fixture at Trump's side since endorsing him in February and will likely have his eye on a spot in the new administration at the Justice Department or in the White House.
Steve Bannon The Breitbart News executive became Trump's campaign CEO in August. He could be in line for a spot as a White House adviser.

By Paul Craig Roberts
 Who are the anti-Trump protesters besmirching the name of progressives by pretending to be progressives and by refusing to accept the outcome of the presidential election? They look like, and are acting worse than, the ?white trash? that they are denouncing.
I think I know who they are. They are thugs for hire and are paid by the Oligarchy to delegitimize Trump?s presidency in the way that Washington and the German Marshall Fund paid students in Kiev to protest the democratically elected Ukrainian government in order to prepare the way for a coup.
The organization, change.org, which claims to be a progressive group, but might be a front, along with other progressive groups, for the Oligarchy, is destroying the reputation of all progressives by circulating a petition that directs the electors of the Electoral Collage to annul the election by casting their votes for Hillary. Remember how upset progressives were when Trump said he might not accept the election result if there was evidence that the vote was rigged? Now progressives are doing what they damned Trump for saying he might do under certain conditions.
The Western presstitutes used the protests in Kiev to delegitimize a democratically elected government and to set it up for a coup. The protest pay was good enough that non-Ukrainians came from nearby countries to participate in the protest in order to collect the money. At the time I posted the amounts paid daily to protesters. Reports came in to me from Eastern and Western Europe from people who were not Ukrainian but were paid to protest as if they were Ukrainians.
The same thing is going on with the Trump protests. CNN reports that ?for many Americans across the country, Donald Trump?s victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept. Tens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight.? This is the exact reporting that the Oligarchy desired from its presstitutes and got.
I hope no one thinks that simultaneous protests in 25 cities were a spontaneous event. How did 25 independent protests manage to come up with the same slogans and the same signs on the same night following the election?
What is the point of the protests, and what interest is served by them? As the Romans always asked, ?who benefits??
There is only one answer: The Oligarchy and only the Oligarchy benefits.
Trump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends to stop the giveaway of American jobs to foreigners. The jobs giveaway, sanctified by the neoliberal junk economists as ?free trade,? is one of the main reasons for the 21st century worsening of the US income distribution. Money that was formerly paid in middle class wages and salaries to American manufacturing employees and college graduates has been re-routed to the pockets of the One Percent.
When US corporations move their production of goods and services sold to Americans offshore to Asian countries, such as China and India, their wage bill falls. The money formerly paid in middle class incomes goes instead into executive bonuses and dividends and capital gains to shareholders. The ladders of upward mobility that had made America the land of opportunity were dismantled for the sole purpose of making a handful of people multi-billionaires.
Trump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends peaceful relations with Russia. In order to replace the profitable Soviet Threat, the Oligarchy and their neoconservative agents worked overtime to recreate the ?Russian Threat? by demonizing Russia.
Accustomed to many decades of excess profits from the profitable Cold War, the military/security complex was angry when President Reagan brought the Cold War to an end. Before these leaches on American taxpayers could get the Cold War going again, the Soviet Union collapsed as a result of a right-wing coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
The military/security complex and their zionist neoconservative agents cooked up ?the war on terror? to keep the money flowing to the One Percent. But as hard as the presstitute media worked to create fear of ?the Muslim threat,? even insouciant Americans knew that the Muslims did not have thousands of ICBMs carrying powerful thermo-nuclear weapons capable of destroying the entirety of the United States in a few minutes. Neither did the Muslims have the Red Army capable of overrunning all of Europe in a couple of days. Indeed, the Muslims haven?t needed an army. Refugees from Washington?s wars enabled by Europeans are overrunning Europe.
The excuse for the annual trillion dollar ($1,000 billion ) military/security budget was missing. So the Oligarchy created ?the New Hitler? in Russia. Hillary was the Oligarchy?s principle agent for heating up the new Cold War.
Hillary is the tool, enriched by the Oligarchy, whose job as President was to protect and to increase the trillion dollar budget of the military/security complex. With Hillary in the White House, the looting of the American taxpayers in behalf of the wealth of the One Percent could go forward unimpeded. But if Trump resolves ?the Russian threat,? the Oligarchy takes an income hit.
Hillary?s job as President was also to privatize Social Security in order that her Wall Street benefactors can rip off Americans the way that Americans have been ripped off by the insurance companies under Obamacare.
Those Americans who do not pay attention think, mistakenly, that the FBI cleared Hillary of violating National Security protocols with her email practices. The FBI said that Hillary did violate National Security, but that it was a result of carelessness or ignorance. She got off from indictment, because the FBI concluded that she did not intentionally violate National Security protocols. The investigation of the Clinton Foundation continues.
In other words, in order to protect Hillary the FBI fell back on the ancient common law rule that ?there can be no crime without intent.? (See PCR and Lawrence Stratton, The Tyranny of Good Intentions .)
One would think that protesters, if they were legitimate, would be celebrating Trump?s victory. He, unlike Hillary, promises to reduce tensions with powerful Russia, and we hope also with China. Unlike Hillary, Trump says he is concerned with the absence of careers for those very people protesting in the streets of 25 cities against him.
In other words, the protests against the American people for electing Trump as their president are pointless. The protests are happening for one reason only. The Oligarchy intends to delegitimize the Trump Presidency. Once President Trump is delegitimized, it will be easier for the Oligarchy to assassinate him. Unless the Oligarchy can appoint and control Trump?s government, Trump is a prime candidate for assassination.
The protests against Trump are suspicious for another reason. Unlike Hillary, Obama, and George W. Bush, Donald Trump has not slaughtered and dislocated millions of peoples in seven countries, sending millions of refugees from the Oligarchy?s wars to overrun Europe.
Trump earned his fortune, and if by hook or crook, not by selling US government influence to foreign agents as Bill and Hillary did.
So what are the protesters protesting?
There is no answer except that they are hired to protest. Just as the Maidan protesters in Kiev were hired to protest by US and German financed NGOs.
The protests in Kiev were equally pointless, because presidential elections were only months away. If Ukrainians really believed that their president was conspiring with Russia to keep Ukraine from becoming a Western puppet state and wished to become a puppet state regardless of the costs, the opportunity to vote the government out was at hand. The only reason for the protests was to orchestrate a coup. The US did succeed in putting their agent in control of the new Ukrainian government as Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev confirmed in their telephone conversation that is available on the Internet.
The Maidan protests were pointless except for making a coup possible. The protests were without any doubt arranged by Washington through Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, a neoconservative brought into the State Department by Hillary Clinton for the purpose of creating conflict with Russia.
Trump is being protested in order to make him vulnerable in the event he proves to be the threat to the Oligarchy that he is thought to be.
Trump won the presidency, but the Oligarchy is still in power, which makes any real reforms difficult to achieve. Symbolic reforms can be the product of the contest between President Trump and the oligarchs.
Karl Marx learned from historical experience, and Lenin, Stalin, and Pol Pot learned from Karl Marx, that change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them. We have proof of this throughout South America. Every revolution by the indigenous people has left unmolested the Spanish ruling class, and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and Washington.
Washington has conspired with traditional elites to remove the elected presidents of Honduras on a number of occasions. Recently, Washington helped elites evict the female presidents of Argentina and Brazil. The presidents of Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia are in the crosshairs and are unlikely to survive. Washington is determined to get its hands on Julian Assange. To achieve this Washington intends to overthrow the Ecuadoran government that, in defiance of Washington, gave Julian Assange political asylum.
Hugo Chavez had the power to exile or to exterminate the Spanish ruling class in Venezuela when the ruling class participated in a CIA coup against Chavez. But before the CIA could kill Chavez, the people and the military forced his release. Instead of punishing the criminals who would have murdered him, Chavez let them go.
According to Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, this is the classic mistake of the revolutionary. To rely on good will from the overthrown ruling class is the certain road to the defeat of the revolution.
Latin American has proved itself unable to learn this lesson: Revolutions cannot be conciliatory.
Trump is a dealmaker. The Oligarchy can permit him the sheen of success in exchange for no real change.
Trump is not perfect. He might fail on his own. But we should back him on the two most important elements in his program: to reduce tensions between the major nuclear powers, and to halt Washington?s policy of permitting globalism to destroy Americans? economic prospects.
If tensions between nuclear powers worsen, we won?t be here to worry about other problems. The combination of the economy hollowed out by globalism and immigration is an economic nightmare. That Trump understands this is reason to support him.
Note: Some believe that Trump is a ruse conducted by the Oligarchy. However, as Hillary is the bought-and-paid-for representative of the Oligarchy, such an elaborate ruse is unnecessary. It is preferable for the Oligarchy to win on its own platform than to install a president on the opposite platform and then change him around. Another sellout increases the anger of the people. If Hillary had won, the Oligarchy would have had the voters? mandate for their platform.

 U.S. presidents possess almost unilateral power to drop bombs on other countries, says historian Thaddeus Russell, and that's why it's very good news that Trump is most libertarian when it comes to foreign policy.
Russell, who's the author of A Renegade History of the United States and is currently writing a book on foreign policy, says Trump's enmity with the neocons at National Review and The Weekly Standard is ""fantastic news for us and the world."" He points out that Trump advisor (and likely future cabinet member) Newt Gingrich gave a 2013 interview with The Washington Times expressing second thoughts about his neocon past.
Though Trump has pledged to go after ISIS, his general philosophy seems far preferable to Hillary's systematic and carefully thought-out Wilsonian foreign policy. ""I don't see a war with Russia and I don't see greater interventionism generally outside of [a] little pocket of the Middle East,"" says Russell.

 So Donald Trump is the new president of the United States. Allan Lichtman and his ?13 Keys to the White House? have been proved right. The 30-year tradition of predicting the out-come of the US presidential elections continues uninterrupted. Political figures have started checking their social media accounts, deleting Tweets that could be uncomplimentary to Trump. It doesn?t help as the Internet remembers everything.
Some are even more unlucky. French President Francois Hollande said in public recently that Trump ?make you want to retch?. The global political narrative is quickly drifting away from ?the dumb Trump? to ?Congratulations, dear Mr. President, I always knew you would win!?
Journalists who had been vilifying Trump ? and promising apocalypse in case he is elected ? have started debating how he would possibly save the world. Most experts failed in their prognosis. They could not imagine that the erratic Trump will be victorious over reserved, pragmatic, and experienced Clinton. They had their reasons but in their analysis they missed a lot of things.
Why Trump is president-elect Trump is a living example of the American dream. From being a simple middle class Ameri-can, child of second generation German immigrants, he jumped to become a billionaire and then the US president. His penthouse apartment is said to be more luxurious than the White House. He had his own plane before becoming the US president.
More importantly, he has promised to revive the American dream for all Americans, irrespec-tive of their social status. Experts and the so-called elite considered his mannerisms and choice of language as a disadvantage. But instead it turned out to be his advantage as he connected to people in their language.
The fact remains that the elite, and people considering themselves intellectuals, do not form the majority in any society. The US is no different. Trump?s tweets and declarations were shocking for the elites but were very common for the masses. His imperfections made him closer to the ordinary people, especially from the working class. The ?he is one of us? image always works when you deal with the masses. He gambled with it and emerged the winner.
He got a chance to grab the Oval Cabinet as he is not liberal. Shadi Hamid seems right not believing that humans naturally inclined toward liberalism. Moreover, some men continue to remain sexist. If they don?t confess it, they keep this deep inside. Women frequently like more bad guys than respectable family men. They may not confess it but this sometimes reveals where their sympathies lie and how they vote.
A large number of white Americans continue to show racist tendencies. While calls for toler-ance goes on, the influx of immigrants gave a fertile ground for racism and somehow xeno-phobia. During these elections, it appeared, that the Americans had to choose between two candi-dates with little credibility. They opted for change and fresh ideas. Also, the turnout was far lesser than on the previous elections, which indicates disillusionment over the current presi-dential campaign and both the candidates.
Popular vote shows the deep divide in the American society, with Clinton showing ad-vantage over Trump. However, it was the US electoral system that brought Trump to power.
Homeland and foreign policy Apparently he is set to make America great again not by foreign policy and imposing its will but by boosting the economy, retuning to manufacturing and giving new jobs. There is also a possibility that he will put even foreign policy based on business ties. So no help or assis-tance could come for free or without concomitant advantages for the economy.
The tycoon that he has been Trump is aware that money decides everything. He will proba-bly try to implement this rule in policymaking, both at home and abroad. The main motive of the foreign policy could turn into bargain, trading and profit.
Trump is not going to be easy for the Arab leaders. ?You, guys, are out of business? ? these were his words in response to a journalist asking about the President-elect?s policy vision toward the Middle East. Pro-Israeli and mostly anti-Arab, he will not try to solve Arab prob-lems anymore. However, he will continue the US fight against terrorism and probably be more hawkish than Clinton.
In any case, he will not be inclined to treat the Arabs as equal partners. Such an attitude is going to be unacceptable for the Middle Easters powers and could lead to cooling of ties. The same fate ? i.e. no allies, just business ? probably awaits Europe.
Trump and Russia Russia, which was frequently debated during the campaign, is neither a winner nor a looser after this election. First of all, no one really knows who is Mr. Trump and what he is going to do. Secondly, he has Senate and Congress, which will not let him do whatever he likes. Moreover, an anti-Russian spirit prevails in the US no matter what.
With Senate and the Congress, both in Republican hands, they are likely to seriously limit his intentions, as he will have to balance between what he wants and what he actually can. However, this man is hard to deal with. So pressure groups and other instruments of man-agement of the US policy will not probably work with Trump.
Even if there is a shift in the US-Russia relations, this will take a long time. Such a shift is needed anyway and a confrontation isn?t good for the whole world. Trump is probably de-fined to press the reboot button in Russian relations and Russia doesn?t need a weak US. Russia needs to speak with the US, to listen and to be heard. Trump, as a businessman, seems exactly that kind of a figure.
We are entering into a new era that will be hardly predictable but extremely interesting. Clinton had many cards on her hands but failed to play them the right way. Trump has out-smarted her. A game of poker has never been so relevant as an analogy. A spicy 45th season of ?the United States Saga? is about to begin.

November 11, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" WSWS "" - Within a day of the election of Donald Trump, leading Democrats have moved with extraordinary speed to declare their support for the president-elect.
President Barack Obama invited Trump to the White House for a friendly 90-minute meeting on Thursday. He declared afterwards that his ?number-one priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our president-elect is successful.? He added, speaking to Trump, ?I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-Elect, that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed?because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.?
Obama?s declaration stands in stark contrast to his own statements just a few days ago. Then he asserted that Trump ?appears to only care about himself? and ?doesn?t know basic facts that you?d need to know? to be president. He added that Trump ?spent 70 years on this earth showing no regard for working people.?
That was before the Democratic debacle on Election Day. Now he declares his highest priority to be ensuring that Trump is ?successful.?
Obama?s comments followed the statement by Hillary Clinton on Wednesday that she hoped ?[Trump] will be a successful president for all Americans.? Senator Bernie Sanders, the supposed socialist, issued his own groveling statement, declaring, ?To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him.?
With such declarations, the Democrats are in effect abandoning any pretense of acting as an opposition party to a President Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress.
The proclamations of support from top Democrats are made in relation to an individual whose election clearly marks a watershed in American politics. What is coming to power is a government of the extreme right, with fascistic characteristics. There are reports that Trump wants to appoint as his chief of staff Stephen Bannon, the head of Breitbart News, an ultra-right and fascistic media outlet. His top advisors and likely cabinet appointees include reactionary figures such as former New York Mayor Rudolf Giuliani and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.
In their rush to lend the transition of power an aura of normalcy, the Democrats and the media have maintained a studious silence about certain quite striking elements of the election.
No one is noting that a principal factor in the election of Trump was a significant decline in voter turnout. For all of the media talk of a ?surge? of white working class voters behind Trump, the Republican candidate actually received one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney received in losing the 2012 election to Obama. Clinton won 6 million fewer votes than Obama won in his reelection, when the outgoing president obtained significantly fewer votes than he had received in 2008. Also virtually ignored is the extraordinary fact that Trump failed even to win the popular vote. Clinton had a higher percentage of the national vote, but she lost in the Electoral College, which involves a complex and antidemocratic apportionment based on victories in individual states. Trump will take office having failed to secure a plurality, let alone a majority, of the overall vote.
In the entire 240-year history of the United States, there have been only five elections in which the incoming president did not win the popular vote. When this happened in 1876, the Republican, Rutherford B. Hayes, became president, though he had fewer votes than the Democrat, Samuel J. Tilden. The political conflict over the outcome was so intense that the Republicans were able to hold the White House only after agreeing to the effective end of post-Civil War Reconstruction, through the withdrawal of federal troops from the South.
After a split vote in 1888, when Grover Cleveland lost to Benjamin Harrison, the winner of the Electoral Vote was also the winner of the popular vote for the next 112 years. In the 21st century, this anomaly has now happened twice?in 2000 and again in 2016. In the former case, the selection of George W. Bush as president required the intervention of the Supreme Court to halt the recount of ballots in Florida.
Had Trump found himself in the position of Clinton, he would have taken his time before conceding. His concession speech, when and if it came, would have stressed that he had won the popular vote and that ?Crooked Hillary? could not claim a mandate.
The media message would have stressed the need for Clinton to be conciliatory and acknowledge that the majority of the voters had chosen Trump. One can easily imagine CNN announcing the ?breaking news? that Clinton had withdrawn the nomination of Obama?s choice for the Supreme Court and invited the Republicans to name the replacement for the deceased Antonin Scalia.
But the Democrats have done just the opposite.
What is behind this universal about-face? President Obama said perhaps more than he intended when he declared Wednesday that ?we have to remember that we?re actually all on one team. This is an intramural scrimmage??that is, a test competition involving players from the same school.
The United States does not really have an oppositional political system. The divisions between the Democrats and Republicans, and between Clinton and Trump, are of an entirely tactical character. They all defend the same basic interests?those of the corporate and financial aristocracy that controls the political system.
Within this framework, the Democrats are always the more accommodating and conciliatory party, since their rhetorical references to defending the interests of working people?including by the likes of Bernie Sanders?are thoroughly vacuous and insincere. In relation to Trump and the dangers he poses, there is an element of complete complacency, which arises from the fact that the danger is not to the Democrats or the privileged social forces for which they speak, but to the working class.
The chief concern of the Democrats is to contain popular anger. Their moves to circle the wagons around Trump are above all a response to the danger they see of the emergence of popular opposition that threatens not only the incoming government, but the capitalist system itself.
Even as Obama, Clinton, Sanders and company prostrate themselves and pledge their loyalty to Trump, thousands of youth and workers are demonstrating around the country against the president-elect. These protests are only a pale and politically disparate foretaste of mass struggles of the working class that are to come.
What is critical is that the lessons of the 2016 election be drawn and all attempts to keep opposition to war and austerity chained to the political corpse of the Democratic Party be rejected. The task is not to ?take back? the Democratic Party or push it to the left?the inevitable result of that false perspective has already been demonstrated in the reactionary outcome of the Sanders campaign?but to break with both parties of big business and all forms of capitalist politics and build an independent socialist and internationalist movement of the working class.

Trump Induces First Major Policy Change On Syria By Moon Of Alabama
November 11, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" Moon Of Alabama "" - The people loyal to the Syrian government are happy with Donald Trump winning the U.S. election:
At the passport counter, a Syrian officer?s face lit up when he saw an American traveler. ?Congratulations on your new president!? he exclaimed, giving an energetic thumbs up. Mr. Trump, he said, would be ?good for Syria.?
The first significant step of the new administration comes while Trump is not even in offices. Obama, selfishly concerned with his historic legacy, suddenly makes a 180 degree turn and starts to implement Trump polices. Lets consider the initial position :
Asked about Aleppo in an October debate with Clinton, Trump said it was a humanitarian disaster but the city had ""basically"" fallen. Clinton, he said, was talking in favor of rebels without knowing who they were. The rebels fighting Assad in western Syria include nationalists fighting under the Free Syrian Army banner, some of them trained in a CIA-backed program, and jihadists such as the group formerly known as the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front.
The Obama administration, through the CIA led by Saudi asset John Brennan, fed weapons, training and billions of dollars to ""moderate rebels"". These then turned around (vid) and either gave the CIA gifts to al-Qaeda in Syria (aka Jabhat al Nusra) or joined it themselves. The scheme was no secret at all and Russia as well as Syria pointed this out several times. The Russian foreign Minister Lavrov negotiated with the U.S. secretary of State Kerry who promised to separate the ""moderate rebels"" from al-Qaeda. But Kerry never delivered. Instead he falsely accuse Russia of committing atrocities that never happened. The CIA kept the upper hand within the Obama administration and continued its nefarious plans.
That changed the day the president-elect Trump set foot into the White House. While Obama met Trump in the oval office, new policies, prepared beforehand, were launched. The policies were held back until after the election and would likely not have been revealed or implemented if Clinton had won.
The U.S. declared that from now on it will fight against al-Qaeda in Syria:
President Obama has ordered the Pentagon to find and kill the leaders of an al-Qaeda-linked group in Syria that the administration had largely ignored until now and that has been at the vanguard of the fight against the Syrian government, U.S. officials said. That shift is likely to accelerate once President-elect Donald Trump takes office. ... possibly in direct cooperation with Moscow .
...
U.S. officials who opposed the decision to go after al-Nusra?s wider leadership warned that the United States would effectively be doing the Assad government's bidding by weakening a group on the front line of the counter-Assad fight.
...
Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and other Pentagon leaders initially resisted the idea of devoting more Pentagon surveillance aircraft and armed drones against al-Nusra.
Ash Carter is, together with John Brennan, the major anti-Russian force in the Obama administration. He is a U.S. weapon industry promoter and the anti-Russia campaign, which helps to sell U.S. weapons to NATO allies in Europe, is largely of his doing. He saw al-Qaeda in Syria as a welcome proxy force against Russia.
But Obama has now shut down that policy. We are not yet sure that this is for good but the above Washington Post account is not the only signal :
The U.S. Department of the Treasury?s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took action today to disrupt al-Nusrah Front?s military, recruitment, and financing operations. Specifically, OFAC designated four key al-Nusrah Front leaders ? Abdallah Muhammad Bin-Sulayman al-Muhaysini , Jamal Husayn Zayniyah, Abdul Jashari, and Ashraf Ahmad Fari al-Allak ? pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, which targets terrorists and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism.
...
These designations were taken in coordination with the U.S. Department of State, which today named Jabhat Fath al Sham as an alias of al-Nusrah Front ? al-Qa?ida?s affiliate in Syria.
...
Abdallah Muhammad Bin-Sulayman al-Muhaysini was designated for acting for or on behalf of, and providing support and services to or in support of, al-Nusrah Front. This is a major change in U.S. policy. Nusra will from now on be on the run not only from Russian and Syrian attacks but also from the intelligence and military capabilities of the United States.
The newly designated Al-Muhaysini, a Saudi cleric, is Nusra's chief ideologue in Syria. Some considered him the new Osama Bin-Laden. Here he is, on the left, arm in arm with chief al-Qaeda in Syria propagandist and ""journalist"" Hadi Abdullah.
Hadi Abdullah, friend of the designated al-Qaeda terrorist Muhaysini, just received the 2016 Press Freedom Price from the CIA/Soros financed ""regime change"" influence operation Reporters Without Borders. Might this mean that Hadi Abdullah is himself a CIA assets? He would not be the first such ""journalist"" in Syria.
Obama, obviously as a direct consequence of the Trump election, now ordered the Pentagon to wage war on al-Qaeda in Syria just as the Russians do. This after five years of nearly unlimited U.S. support for al-Qaeda and its ""moderate"" Syrian affiliates. It is not yet know what new orders, if any, Obama gave to the CIA. Will the CIA follow these policies or will it (again) try to counter the Pentagon policies in Syria? It is unusual that the WaPo report above about this new direction includes no commenting voice from the CIA. Why is such missing?
Russia and Syria will welcome the new Obama policies should they come to fruit on the ground. Hillary Clinton had planned and announced to widen the conflict in Syria and with Russia and Iran. Obama would surely not have acted against such policies if she had been elected. But with Trump winning and thereby a new policy on the horizon he now changed course to a direction that will provide ""continuity"" when Trump takes over.
Not only is Trump kicking a black family out of its longtime limewashed home, he also ends U.S. government support for the disenfranchised Jihadis in Syria and elsewhere. This even months before taking office. He really is the menace we have all been warned about.",english,2016-11-12T14:09:14.799+02:00,informationclearinghouse.info,US,82758,Trump Induces First Major Policy Change On Syria  : Information,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

November 11, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - On Election Day, Hillary Clinton, with all her data specialists and poll gurus, came up short. The morning after, they didn?t know what hit them ? that is, the unexpected fact that statistical data and real life don?t always coincide. People often tell pollsters what they think the pollsters want to hear, or what media tells them is the expected answer, while clandestinely harboring different opinions that they share only with their family, friends and drinking buddies.
Hillary Clinton and the Democratic leadership, as well as their Republican Party counterparts, represent a well-entrenched political system. That system is responsive to lobbies or interest groups and not disgruntled citizens. What is more, none of the country?s political bosses can see beyond this system and how it relates to their own political needs.
During the 2016 election campaign that near sightedness led to a fatal misinterpretation: that Trump represented only hooligans and ?deplorable? people who could not themselves possibly add up to a ?silent majority.? Thinking along these lines, Clinton and the overconfident Democratic establishment made a perhaps unconscious decision to let this apparent bozo Trump lose the election, rather than they, the Democrats, going out there and doing what was necessary to win it.
For instance, they apparently did not bother to design a message to compete for the votes of those listening to Trump. They did not take into consideration the historically observable fact that millions of Americans had, over the last 50 years, seemed to give up on politics because they saw the system as unresponsive. The Democrat establishment did not respond to this phenomenon. Indeed, they made sure Bernie Sanders, the only Democratic who was trying to respond, would fail.
A Deep Division
The truth is that the United States is a very deeply divided country, and has been since the 1960s. The division is multifaceted and involves cultural issues that touch on gender, race and lifestyle; and class issues such as job creation and trade treaties. Also, the city mouse/country mouse divide is very real and very deep.
Much of rural white America has various degrees of negative feelings toward African-Americans, Latinos, Asians and anyone else who does not look and talk like them. These are the same sort of people who once hated kids with long hair, afros, and a preference for marijuana over whiskey.
All of these disgruntled ones, like those millions of Christian Fundamentalists out there, have never gone away. They were just waiting ? even if some of them didn?t know it. They were waiting for a ?hero,? and when he appeared, they elected him president.
So the divisions are real and they are not new. And no one in the political establishment, Democrat or Republican, addressed them. That opened the door for Mr. Trump.
That means Trump?s victory should not properly be seen as a Republican Party victory. Trump just exploited the party label. In truth, he has destroyed the Republican Party as we traditionally knew it. Its future is very uncertain.
What Can We Expect?
Donald Trump has made a fetish out of being unpredictable, which, at the very least, is bad for the stock market. Inevitably, however, there will be signs that give a hint as to what might be expected.
For instance, Trump will have to name a cabinet. Interestingly enough, most of those who will be available, be they private-sector business people or right-wing goofballs like Sarah Palin and Chris Christie, are creatures of the standing political system. They have no real interest in reforming current ways of doing things as against profiting from them ? which, of course, is a form of business as usual.
There will be tremendous pressure on Donald Trump to go along with and slot himself into the existing political system in Washington (as did President Obama). At every turn, in Congress and in the bureaucracies, there will be no one to deal with but systems people.
Beyond a limited number of exclusively executive functions, Trump needs standing political arrangements to operate. Thus, if he suddenly turns relatively conventional, no one should be too surprised. What about all that campaign rebel talk? Well, remember, he is unpredictable which, in his case, goes well with also being a consistent liar.
Trump promised a lot during the campaign. He was going to rebuild the inner cities, the military, all of the nation?s bridges, etc. And he would do so while simultaneously lowering taxes. Short of bankrupting the country, this is fiscally impossible.
He promised to remake foreign policy, which, being within the realm of executive power, may be more doable. Will he try to cancel international trade agreements? Will he pull out of NATO? Will he dump the Zionists and the Saudis? Will he ally with the Russians?
These are interesting questions. What about global warming, which he claims not to believe in? How about international law and our relationship to the United Nations? It?s all up for grabs, and that worries a lot of people ? very few of whom voted for Trump.
Many of those who did vote for Donald Trump don?t care about any of this. They voted for him because he appeared to stand against the political system they hate. They want the country ethnically cleansed of Mexicans, the government downsized and, culturally, the clock turned back to the 1950s. If he does not do this, he will appear to have become part of that hateful system, and his fans may well end up hating him too.

By Chemi Shalev WASHINGTON ? Those were the best of times, arguably, but these may be the worst of times. That?s the way most American Jews must feel as they wake up with a massive hangover from the shock election results and the reality that Donald Trump will soon be President of the United States.
Whatever differences American Jews may have had with Barack Obama over the Iran nuclear deal and Middle East peace, they?ve never had a president who was more in tune with their Jewish and liberal essence.
Obama was the realization of the American Jewish vision of a multicultural society, a dream come true for a generation of civil rights activists. He promoted and embodied the liberal ideals that American Jews are more attached to than any other religious group in America. And he was more knowledgeable about American Jewish culture and Yiddishkeit than any previous president, bar none. Even when they disagreed with him, most American Jews, with the exception of the vocal minority that hated his guts, viewed Obama as a mensch.
It is probably no coincidence that during his tenure, American Jews reached a pinnacle of social and cultural acceptance. Being American Jews was hip. It was cool. It was the thing to be. From Jon Stewart to Jerry Seinfeld, from Joe Lieberman to Bernie Sanders, Jews seemed to be more entrenched than ever before in the American mainstream. Pew Research Polls repeatedly confirmed that Jews were the most loved and most admired religious group in all of America. Mashiach-zeit, old timers would say, but with a note of caution, because if Jewish history teaches anything, it is that all things must pass.
The election of Donald Trump has shattered the Jewish idyll, all across the board. Although one must give the president-elect the benefit of the doubt that he is not an anti-Semite himself, he has frequently promoted disparaging Jewish stereotypes in his personal statements. Sunday evening?s appointment of former Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon as chief strategist in the White House is bound to exacerbate Jewish tensions. He is considered the standard bearer for the racist, anti-immigrant alt-right movement and has been accused of harboring anti-Semitic sentiments himself.
Trump has repeatedly and unapologetically disseminated white supremacist tweets. His campaign has used anti-Semitic symbols that Trump has failed to disown even when advised of their offensive content. He has distanced himself from his neo-Nazi supporters only under duress. And under his wings, America has seen an unprecedented outburst of blunt and naked hatred of Jews, which has only gotten worse since his election.
In recent months, most prominent Jewish journalists and other public critics of Trump have been harassed by anti-Semites on social media, in their mail at home and, in some cases, in close physical contact. Swastikas have been painted at schools. Jewish students have been threatened, taunted, told that Adolf Hitler was right all along. Along with Muslims, Hispanics, and African Americans, they are being targeted as the sworn enemies of the America First Weltanschauung that Trump is bringing with him to the White House.
The shock that many Jews are feeling now is partly of their making. In recent years, the American Jewish establishment has willingly enlisted in the Israeli government?s effort to depict ever-widening circles of anti-Israeli agitation on the left as anti-Semitism. The fight against BDS and the efforts to portray it as hatred of Jews in another form has consumed the time, energy and resources of the American Jewish leadership, with the possible exception of the Anti-Defamation League.
Meanwhile, virulent and classic anti-Semitism lurking just under the radical right?s surface was virtually ignored, concealed by the mainstream right-wing?s overwhelming support for Israel. Even mentioning it was considered to be an anti-Israeli provocation.
Trump?s triumph has unleashed the pent up resentment against Jews. His reluctance to tackle manifestations of racism and white supremacism among his supporters has energized and empowered it. If he and his advisers don?t take assertive steps soon, anti-Jewish agitators will feel they have a license from the White House to do as they please. They will get bolder, grow stronger, recruit new adherents and increasingly resort to violence: we?ve seen it before.
But even if brazen anti-Semitic incidents are quelled or die down by themselves, there is no denying that Jews have transformed virtually overnight from insiders to outsiders. Not only did they vote overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, prominent conservative Jews who could have allayed their concerns are the ones who have distanced themselves from Trump over the course of the campaign and will play no role in his administration.
American Jewish liberals are bound to feel alienated from their own government in way they?ve never felt before. Most of the values, goals and policy objectives of the Trump administration, even if they turn out to be a paler and more palatable version of his campaign rhetoric, are diametrically opposed to those of most American Jews. They support immigration, pluralism, multiculturalism, social reform, government intervention, separation of church and state, gay marriage, abortion rights and on and on. It is easy to see, in fact, why so many of Trump?s radical supporters would view the Jews as their mortal enemies.
As Shmuel Rosner rightly points out for the wrong reasons, Trump may ultimately divide Israeli and American Jews. But the reason for that is not limited, as Rosner asserts, to the yet to be proven assumption that American Jews will resent their Israeli counterparts for liking Trump because he is pro-Israel. It is because Trump?s core message, his reactionary, nativist, chauvinistic, anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant and mainly anti-Muslim worldview is shared by far too many, though far from all Israelis, and is embraced by its ruling coalition. And because many Israeli Jews are indifferent to right-wing anti-Semitism and indeed share right-wing disdain toward the liberalism of American Jews.
Of course, all may not be bleak. Perhaps Trump will fight the anti-Semitism on his radical fringe with increasing vigor. Possibly his policies will be less offensive to American Jews. Perhaps the American Jewish establishment will produce a leadership capable of meeting these trying times. Who knows, maybe some American Jews will finally realize they should support Israeli Jews who share their worldview rather than a government that doesn?t.
And if worse comes to worst, to paraphrase Casablanca, liberal American Jews will always have Israel itself. Moderate, liberal Israelis, beleaguered and on the point of despair, will flock to the airport to welcome them with open arms. Mashiach-zeit, they will tell themselves, in awe. ?

43299842215df534ca751870d5900f97ef06a18b,0,RT,2016-11-13T02:00:00.000+02:00,"Trump Warns That By Attacking Assad, US Will ?End Up Fighting Russia?      : Information"," Trump Warns That By Attacking Assad, US Will ?End Up Fighting Russia? By RT November 13, "" RT "" - US President-elect Donald Trump has confirmed that he will most likely abandon the Obama administration policy on Syria to seek a possible rapprochement with Russia on the issue of Assad.
?I?ve had an opposite view of many people regarding Syria,? the 70-year-old Republican told the Wall Street Journal in his first interview since the election.
From the start of the Syrian war, Barack Obama?s foreign policy has been focused on the support and training of the so-called ?moderate? rebel groups who were supposed to defeat Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists, and survive to eventually overthrow Assad. That approach became deadlocked this year when Washington failed to honor its obligations under an agreement with Moscow to separate their moderate rebel forces from internationally-recognized terrorists.
Trump, on the other hand, said on Friday that the US should be focused on fighting Islamic State, instead of pursuing regime change in Syria.
?My attitude was you?re fighting Syria, Syria is fighting ISIS, and you have to get rid of ISIS. Russia is now totally aligned with Syria, and now you have Iran, which is becoming powerful, because of us, is aligned with Syria... Now we?re backing rebels against Syria, and we have no idea who these people are.?
It has been widely documented and reported that American weapons supplied to the moderate rebels are often obtained by extremists in Syria. Those weapons, in turn, are being used by the jihadists to strike civilian positions and deploy them against Syrian forces.
The president-elect warned that if the US attacks Assad, ?we end up fighting Russia, fighting Syria.?
The US coalition bombing of Syrian Army positions near the city of Deir el-Zour on September 17 led to the collapse of the US-Russian peace initiative.
Rapprochement in US-Russia ties could, however, be on the horizon after Trump admitted receiving a ?beautiful? letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump said a phone call between them is scheduled shortly.
Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are ?very much alike... in their basic approaches toward international affairs,? Dmitry Peskov told the Associated Press earlier.
?[Trump] has been a very firm supporter of the idea of a good relationship between our countries, because we do carry a joint responsibility for strategic stability in the world, strategic security,? the spokesman said.
Immediately after Trump's victory, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Moscow looks forward to restoring bilateral relations with the United States.
The US military establishment, however, already seems to be working against Trump's policies. In an interview with CBS This Morning, Defense Secretary Ash Carter leveled a barrage of accusations at Russia.
He said the Russian campaign in Syria ?fuels the fires? of ongoing violence in the country, claiming ?they?re not doing what we need to do and think needs to be done [in Syria].?
?What the Russians said, if you?ll remember, was that they were going to come in and fight terrorism and help remove Assad,? Carter said. ?They haven?t done either of those things. They haven't done any of that.?
While Moscow has been undertaking efforts to eliminate Islamic State and Al-Nusra Front terrorists in Syria, it never said it would take part in the forcible removal of President Bashar Assad.
When the anchor Norah O?Donnell said ?They're helping Assad?? Carter continued, ?Exactly. Which in turn simply fuels the fires of the Syrians civil war. So the Russians have been completely backwards there, in what they've been doing.
?So we have not been able to, and I have not been in favor, and am not recommending to the president that we associate ourselves with or work with the Russians until they start doing the right thing,? Carter concluded.",english,2016-11-15T00:54:15.963+02:00,informationclearinghouse.info,US,82758,"Trump Warns That By Attacking Assad, US Will ?End Up Fighting Russia?      : Information",0.508,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

By DAVID E. SANGER November 13, "" NYT "" - WASHINGTON ? President-elect Donald J. Trump said Friday that he was likely to abandon the American effort to support ?moderate? opposition groups in Syria who are battling the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying ?we have no idea who these people are.?
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal that dealt largely with economic issues, including his willingness to retain parts of the Affordable Care Act, he repeated a position he took often during his campaign: that the United States should focus on defeating the Islamic State, and find common ground with the Syrians and their Russian backers.
?I?ve had an opposite view of many people regarding Syria,? Mr. Trump told The Journal. ?My attitude was you?re fighting Syria, Syria is fighting ISIS, and you have to get rid of ISIS. Russia is now totally aligned with Syria, and now you have Iran, which is becoming powerful, because of us, is aligned with Syria.?
His comments suggest that once Mr. Trump begins overseeing both the public support for the opposition groups, and a far larger covert effort run by the Central Intelligence Agency, he may wind down or abandon the effort. But there are in fact two wars going on simultaneously in Syria.
One is against the Islamic State, in which the United States is supporting 30,000 Syrian-Kurdish and Syrian-Arab fighters, who last weekend announced they were opening a new phase of the battle, beginning to encircle the ISIS capital in Raqqa. There are roughly 300 United States Special Operations forces on the ground assisting these militia.
The second effort is in support of rebels fighting Mr. Assad. The C.I.A. covert program is by far the largest conduit of support, providing antitank missiles to rebels fighting the government. That is the program that Mr. Trump seems most intent on ending. If the United States pursues that line, ?We end up fighting Russia, fighting Syria,? Mr. Trump told The Journal.
The argument for ending the support may be bolstered by the fact that, as a matter of survival, those opposition groups have entered into battlefield alliances with the affiliate of Al Qaeda in Syria, formerly known as Al Nusra. This has had the effect of allowing Mr. Assad and Russia to argue that they are attacking Al Qaeda, and the United States should aid them in that effort. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that argument during his ultimately failed effort to reach a deal for a cease-fire and an ultimate settlement.
Mr. Trump?s the-enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend logic is consistent with what he said during the campaign. ?I?m not saying Assad is a good man, ?cause he?s not,? he told The New York Times in an interview in March, ?but our far greater problem is not Assad, it?s ISIS.?
But it also takes a position that will gratify President Vladimir V. Putin, because it suggests that rather than pressure Russia to end its support of Mr. Assad, a Trump administration will get out of Mr. Putin?s way.
In another hint of a major change in policy, one of Mr. Trump?s primary national security advisers, Lt. General Michael T. Flynn, the retired head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, wrote in The Hill newspaper this week that the United States should extradite Fethullah Gulen who Turkey has demanded should be sent back from his exile in Pennsylvania. The Turkish government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed him for a coup attempt over the summer.
The Justice Department has not yet concluded that there is any convincing evidence that Mr. Gulen should be sent back to almost certain confinement or execution under an extradition treaty with the United States. They see the request as part of Mr. Erdogan?s effort to eliminate all opposition.
Mr. Flynn adopted many of Turkey?s arguments about Mr. Gulen, arguing that ?American taxpayers are helping finance Gulen?s 160 charter schools? in the United States, and that it is more important to support Turkey than be ?hoodwinked by this masked source of terror and instability nestled comfortably in our own backyard.?
Eric Schmitt contributed reporting. President Assad: Syria is ready to co-operate with Donald Trump : The US is currently enmeshed in a complicated alliance in Syria with Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who would like to provide rebels ? among them al-Qaeda-backed factions ? with surface-to-air missiles. What will Trump do on Syria?: The US should get out of the war in Syria and avoid destabilising more Middle Eastern countries, and the US should work with Putin to defeat terrorist groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).",english,2016-11-15T00:54:52.745+02:00,informationclearinghouse.info,US,82758,Donald Trump Likely to End Aid for Rebels Fighting Syrian Government    : Information,0.556,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Lesley Stahl: Well, congratulations, Mr. Trump.
Donald Trump: Thank you.
Lesley Stahl: You?re president-elect.
Donald Trump: Thank you.
Lesley Stahl: How surprised were you?
Donald Trump: Well, I really felt we were doing well. I was on a string of about 21 straight days of speeches, sometimes many a day and the last two days I really-- I really had a pretty wild time. I did six speeches and then I did seven and--
Lesley Stahl: But everyone thought you were going to lose.
Donald Trump: I know, I did my final speech in Michigan at 1:00 in the morning and we had 31,000 people, many people outside of the arena. And I felt-- when I left, I said, ?How are we gonna lose?? We set it up a day before. And we had all of these people. And it was literally at 1:00 in the morning and I said, ?This doesn?t look like second place.? So we were really happy, I mean, it was-- these are great people.
Lesley Stahl: On election night, I heard you went completely silent. Was it a sort of realization of the enormity of this thing for you?
 Donald Trump: I think so, it?s enormous. I?ve done a lotta big things, I?ve never done anything like this. It is so big, it is so-- it?s so enormous, it?s so amazing.
 Lesley Stahl: It kind of just took your breath away? Couldn?t talk?
Donald Trump: A li-- a little bit, a little bit. And I think-- I realized that this is a whole different life for me now.
Lesley Stahl: Hillary called you. Tell us about that phone call.
Donald Trump: So Hillary called and it was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her, I mean, I can imagine. Tougher for her than it would have been for me. And for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldn?t have been nicer. She just said, ?Congratulations, Donald, well done.? And I said, ?I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor.? She is very strong and very smart.
Lesley Stahl: What about Bill Clinton? Did you talk to him?
Donald Trump: He did, he called the next day.
Lesley Stahl: Really? What did he say?
Donald Trump: He actually called last night.
Lesley Stahl: What did he say?
Donald Trump: And he-- he couldn?t have been more gracious. He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing he?s ever seen.
Lesley Stahl: He said that.
Donald Trump: He was very, very-- really, very nice.
Lesley Stahl: It was a pretty nasty campaign. Do you regret any of the things you said about her?
Donald Trump: Well, it was a double-side nasty.
Donald Trump: I mean they were tough and I was tough and-- do I regret? I mean, I?m sitting here with you now and we?re gonna do a great job for the country. We?re going to make America great again, I mean, that?s what-- it-- it began with that and that?s where we are right now. There are so many--
Lesley Stahl: So no-- no regrets about--
Donald Trump: I can?t regret. No-- I wish it were softer, I wish it were nicer, I wish maybe even it was more on policy, or whatever you want to say. But-- but I will say that-- it really-- it really is something that I?m very proud of I mean it was a tremendous campaign.
Lesley Stahl: Can we talk about yesterday with President Obama?
Donald Trump: Sure.
Lesley Stahl: 90 minutes. You were scheduled for what? 15?
Donald Trump: 15 max.
[Barack Obama: We talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy.]
Donald Trump: This was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half. And it could have gone on for four hours. I mean it was-- just-- in fact, it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say. And he told me-- the good things and the bad things, there are things that are tough right now--
Lesley Stahl: Like what?
Donald Trump: Well
Lesley Stahl: Give us some meat.
Donald Trump: Well, look I don?t want to divulge, but we talked about the Middle East, that?s tough. It?s a tough situation. I wanted to get his full view and I got his, you know I got a good part of his view.
Lesley Stahl: Uh-huh.
Donald Trump: And I like having that because I?m going to be inheriting that in a short period of time. I found him to be terrific. I found him to be-- very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects.
Donald Trump:?and we were talking about some victories, also, some things that-- that he feels very good about. But--
Lesley Stahl: Like--
Donald Trump: Well, what I really wanted to focus on was-- the Middle East, North Korea, Obamacare is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation.
Lesley Stahl: Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it.
Donald Trump: Well, he didn?t ask me, no, he told me-- you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that.
Lesley Stahl: You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you or--
Donald Trump: No, I think I?m a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I?m not. I?m actually not. I?m a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we had-- we had a very good chemistry going. And-- and I really found?it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting.
[Barack Obama: I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed then the country succeeds.]
Lesley Stahl: Was it at all awkward, at all, given what you?ve said about each other? You said he was not born in this country, he said things about you, he said you?re-- unqualified--
Donald Trump: You know what, it was a very-- it was a very interesting thing because-- I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like?
Lesley Stahl: Yeah.
Donald Trump: We never discussed what was said about each other. I said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. We never ever discussed what we said about each other?
Lesley Stahl: There was no awkwardness?
Donald Trump: I?ll be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And that?s strange. I?m actually surprised to tell you that. It?s-- you know, a little bit strange.
[Donald Trump: Thank you, sir.]
Lesley Stahl: Do you think that-- that your election is a repudiation of his presidency?
Donald Trump: No, I think it?s a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. They?ve let ?em down on the job front. They?ve even let ?em down in terms of the war front. You know, we?ve been fighting this war for 15 years--
Lesley Stahl: This was the message of your campaign.
Donald Trump: We?ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the-- and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of what?s been taking place over a longer period of time than that.
Lesley Stahl: You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16, whatever-- people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president?
Donald Trump: You know, I?ll conduct myself-- in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look at-- when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, it?s going to be America first. It?s not going to be what we?re doing?we, we?ve lost-- we?re losing this country. We?re losing this country. That?s why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big.
 Lesley Stahl: Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in?
 Donald Trump: Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I don?t want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be.
Lesley Stahl: Can you be?
Donald Trump: Sure I can. I can be easily, that?s easier. Honestly to do that, it?s easier.
Lesley Stahl: So let?s go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you?re going to do what you said or you?re going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall?
 Donald Trump: Yes.
Lesley Stahl: They?re talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?
Donald Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I?m very good at this, it?s called construction.
Lesley Stahl: So part wall, part fence?
Donald Trump: Yeah, it could be ? it could be some fencing.
Lesley Stahl: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?
Donald Trump: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we?re getting them out of our country, they?re here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we?re going to make a determination on the people that you?re talking about who are terrific people, they?re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley, it?s very important, we want to secure our border.
[Paul Ryan: We had a fantastic, productive meeting.]
Lesley Stahl: So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was the-- one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away?
Donald Trump: Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. We?re going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes--
Lesley Stahl: And you?ve got both Houses?
Donald Trump: And I have both Houses and we have the presidency, so we can do things--
Lesley Stahl: You can do things lickety-split.
Donald Trump: It?s been a long time since it?s happened.
Donald Trump: And they gave me a lot of credit. Don?t forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going to-- instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed.
Lesley Stahl: You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money.
Donald Trump: Yeah.
Lesley Stahl: You admitted you used to do it yourself. You have a transition team?
Donald Trump: And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests.
 Lesley Stahl: And you want to get rid of all of that?
 Donald Trump: I don?t like it, no.
 Lesley Stahl: You don?t like it, but your own transition team, it?s filled with lobbyists.
 Donald Trump: That?s the only people you have down there.
 Lesley Stahl: You have lobbyists from Verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby.
Donald Trump: Sure. Everybody?s a lobbyist down there--
 Lesley Stahl: Well, wait
 Donald Trump: That?s what they are. They?re lobbyists or special interests?
Lesley Stahl: On your own transition team.
 Donald Trump:?we are trying to clean up Washington. Look--
 Lesley Stahl: How can you claim--
 Donald Trump: Everything, everything down there-- there are no people-- there are all people that work -- that?s the problem with the system, the system. Right now, we?re going to clean it up. We?re having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we?re going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren?t happy about, but we?re putting on term limits. We?re doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.
Lesley Stahl: But you?re, but you?re basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them?
Donald Trump: I?m saying that they know the system right now, but we?re going to phase that out. You have to phase it out.
 Lesley Stahl: Let?s talk about your cabinet.
 Donald Trump: OK.
 Lesley Stahl: Have you made any decisions?
 Donald Trump: Yes.
Lesley Stahl: Tell us.
Donald Trump: Well, I can?t tell you that, but I have made--
Lesley Stahl: Oh, come on?
Donald Trump: You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. First of all, every major leader and probably less than major le- has called me, I?ve spoken to many of them and I?ll call the rest of them, but and I said, ?Boy, this really shows you how powerful our country is.? France and U.K. and I mean everybody, all over Asia?and very, just to congratulate. But it really shows the power of our country.
Lesley Stahl: One of the things you?re going to obviously get an opportunity to do, is name someone to the Supreme Court. And I assume you?ll do that quickly?
Donald Trump: Yes. Very important.
Lesley Stahl: During the campaign, you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights. Will you appoint-- are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade?
Donald Trump: So look, here?s what?s going to happen-- I?m going to-- I?m pro-life. The judges will be pro-life. They?ll be very?
Lesley Stahl: But what about overturning this law--
Donald Trump: Well, there are a couple of things. They?ll be pro-life, they?ll be-- in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody?s talking about the Second Amendment and they?re trying to dice it up and change it, they?re going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and--
 Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but then some women won?t be able to get an abortion?
 Donald Trump: No, it?ll go back to the states.
Lesley Stahl: By state?no some --
 Donald Trump: Yeah.
 Donald Trump: Yeah, well, they?ll perhaps have to go, they?ll have to go to another state.
 Lesley Stahl: And that?s OK?
Donald Trump: Well, we?ll see what happens. It?s got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.
 Lesley Stahl: Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what you?re taking on?
 Donald Trump: No.
 Lesley Stahl: Not at all?
 Donald Trump: I respect it. But I?m not scared by it.
Lesley Stahl: Now you?re not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your rhetoric--
Donald Trump: That?s only because they don?t know me. I really believe that?s only because--
Lesley Stahl: Well, they listened to you in the campaign and that?s--
Donald Trump: I just don?t think they know me.
 Lesley Stahl: Well, what do you think they?re demonstrating against?
Donald Trump: Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had it-- if you look at WikiLeaks, we had--
 Lesley Stahl: You think those people down there are?
 Donald Trump: Well Lesley?
 Lesley Stahl: are professional?
 Donald Trump: Oh, I think some of them will be professional, yeah--
Lesley Stahl: OK, but what about ? they?re in every city.
Lesley Stahl: When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, I mean, don?t you say to yourself, I guess you don?t, you know, do I have to worry about this? Do I have to go out and assuage them? Do I have to tell them not to be afraid? They?re afraid.
 Donald Trump: I would tell them don?t be afraid, absolutely.
Lesley Stahl: But that?s not what you?re saying, I said it-
 Donald Trump: Oh, I think, no, no, I think-- I am saying it, I?ve been saying it.
 Lesley Stahl: OK.
Donald Trump: Don?t be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don?t be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, ?Oh, that?s a terrible thing.? And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here.
It has been five full days since the election and anti-Trump demonstrations, driven in part by Hillary Clinton?s edge in the popular vote, have been significant.
When we interviewed him on Friday afternoon Mr. Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name or against his supporters.
Nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans, Latinos and gays by some of his supporters.
Donald Trump: I am very surprised to hear that-- I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that--
Lesley Stahl: But you do hear it?
Donald Trump: I don?t hear it?I saw, I saw one or two instances
Lesley Stahl: On social media?
Donald Trump: But I think it?s a very small amount. Again, I think it?s--
Lesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people?
Donald Trump: I would say don?t do it, that?s terrible, ?cause I?m gonna bring this country together.
 Lesley Stahl: They?re harassing Latinos, Muslims--
Donald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, ?Stop it.? If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.
During the campaign Mr. Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton?s email issue.
So we asked him if he plans to carry that out.
That part of the interview and a discussion with the next first lady, Melania Trump, when we come back.
On Friday, Donald Trump announced that he was changing the head of his transition team. Governor Chris Christie was replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Trump also added his three older children to the transition team.
Between now and Inauguration Day, the team must fill the new administration with 4,000 political appointees. That?s 4,000 new hires in just nine weeks.
When we talked to Donald Trump on Friday, the enormity and gravity of his new role was just sinking in. He was subdued. We wondered if as president he planned to temper his rhetoric, lower the flame.
Lesley Stahl: I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, I think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators.
Donald Trump: Yeah.
Lesley Stahl: You said that they were professionals?and you said it was unfair.
Donald Trump: I said some of them. Some of them are --
Lesley Stahl: But are you going to be tweeting and whatever you?re upset about just put out there when you?re president?
Donald Trump: So it?s a modern form of communication, between Face-- you know, Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram, I have 28 million people. 28 million people--
Lesley Stahl: So you are going to keep it up?
Donald Trump: It?s a great form of communication. Now, do I say I?ll give it up entirely and throw out, that?s a tremendous form-- I pick up-- I?m picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. I?m not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, ?cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. That?s very tough--
Lesley Stahl: But you?re going to do that as president?
Donald Trump: I?m going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I?m going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It?s a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It?s-- it?s where it?s at. I-- I do believe this, I really believe that, um-- the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they?re spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.
Lesley Stahl: Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail?
Donald Trump: Well, I?ll tell you what I?m going to do, I?m going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we?ve been talking about.
Lesley Stahl: You-- you know, you--
Donald Trump: And get the country straightened away.
Lesley Stahl: You called her ?crooked Hillary,? said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, ?Lock em? up.?
Donald Trump: Yeah. She did--
Lesley Stahl: Do you?
Donald Trump: She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things--
Lesley Stahl: I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might
Donald Trump: I don?t want to hurt them. I don?t want to hurt them. They?re, they?re good people. I don?t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.
With that
[Donald Trump: You look great, honey.]
We were joined by the next first lady, Melania Trump. She?ll be only the second foreign-born first lady. She?s from Slovenia. John Quincy Adams? wife Louisa was the first.
Lesley Stahl: You know, I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead. The enormity. You?re about to be first lady. Are you a little nervous about it? Little tense? A little--
Melania Trump: Well, there is a lot of responsibilities. And it?s-- a lot of work needs to be done. And-- it?s-- your-- stuff on your shoulders. And-- we will take care of it-- day by day. I will stay true to myself. I?m very strong and um-- tough and confident. And I will listen myself and I will do what is right and what feels to my heart.
Lesley Stahl: What kind of a first lady do you think she?s going to be?
Donald Trump: She will be terrific. She is very strong and very confident, but she?s very warm. And I think she?ll have a platform where she?ll really be able to do a lot of good. And that?s what she wants to do.
Lesley Stahl: You know, first ladies usually have a cause. And you?ve already said you?re interested in speaking out against bullying on social media.
Melania Trump: I think it?s very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt. And we need to teach them how to talk to each other, how to treat each other and to, to be able to connect with each other on the right way.
It?s an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign.
Lesley Stahl: What about your husband?s tweeting?
Melania Trump: Well, sometimes he-- it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following.
Lesley Stahl: So you never say to him, ?Come on??
Melania Trump: I did.
Donald Trump: She does--
Melania Trump: I--
Melania Trump: You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But
Lesley Stahl: Does he listen to you?
Melania Trump: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn?t--
Donald Trump: I?m not a big tweeter. I mean, I don?t do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across.
Lesley Stahl: If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him?
Melania Trump: Yes, I tell him all the time.
Lesley Stahl: All the time?
Melania Trump: All the time.
Lesley Stahl: And does--
Melania Trump: And--
Lesley Stahl: --he listen? Does he--
Melania Trump: I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. He?s an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it.
Lesley Stahl: Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval?
Donald Trump: Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way he?s affected every bit as much. Maybe more.
Lesley Stahl: Maybe more.
Donald Trump: And so we all had a dinner and I said, ?I would like to do this. I think I can do a great job.? And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed.
Lesley Stahl: Your son Barron, what is he, 10?
Melania Trump: 10.
Lesley Stahl: 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know?
Melania Trump: He knows. He knows--
Lesley Stahl: He knows?
Melania Trump: --what?s going on. And, he?s very proud of his dad.
Lesley Stahl: Now-- you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness, given--
Melania Trump: No.
Lesley Stahl: --what everybody was saying about everybody in the campaign?
Melania Trump: No. I didn?t feel it.
Lesley Stahl: Not at all?
Melania Trump: No.
Lesley Stahl: Tell us about the meeting.
Melania Trump: Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice.
Lesley Stahl: You know, she raised the two kids in the White House. But she had her mother living there. That?s an enormous help. Your parents are here, right?
Melania Trump: They?re here.
Lesley Stahl: Will they go to Washington with you?
Melania Trump: They might. We will see. We will discuss that.
Lesley Stahl: Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hair?s out of place. Are you both prepared for this?
Melania Trump: We are used to it.
Donald Trump: I will say, it is on a different scale now, ?cause I?ve had a lot. But I?ve never had anything like this.
Lesley Stahl: You won?t be able to walk down the street--
Melania Trump: I didn?t do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It?s another level, but it will continue.
At that point, the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues Mr. Trump faces.
Lesley Stahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation?
Donald Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don?t-- I haven?t made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think --
Lesley Stahl: Even though they leak so much?
Donald Trump: Well, there?s been a lotta leaking, there?s no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I?d answer a question like that.
Lesley Stahl: Sounds like you?re not sure.
Donald Trump: Well, sure, I?m not sure. I?d wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did.
Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna release your tax returns?
Donald Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I?m under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn?t care because I won the election very easily. So they don?t care. I never thought they did care.
Lesley Stahl: Now, for months, you were running around saying that the system is rigged, the whole thing was rigged. You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracy.
Donald Trump: I do.
Lesley Stahl: So do you still think it?s rigged?
Donald Trump: Well, I think the electoral ca-- look, I won with the Electoral College.
Lesley Stahl: Exactly.But do you think--
Donald Trump: You know, it?s--
Lesley Stahl: --it?s rigged?
Donald Trump: Yeah, some of the election locations are. Some of the system is. I hated--
Lesley Stahl: Even though you won you?re saying that--
Donald Trump: I hated-- well, you know, I?m not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There?s a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and there?s something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system.
Lesley Stahl: What about vacations? You?re not going to take any vacations? You?ve said that.
Donald Trump: We have so much work. There?s so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. We?re lowering taxes, we?re taking care of health care. I mean, there?s just so much to be done. So I don?t think we?ll be very big on vacations, no.
Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna take the salary, the president?s salary?
Donald Trump: Well, I?ve never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I?ll take $1 a year. But it?s a -- I don?t even know what it is.
Donald Trump: Do you know what the salary is?
Lesley Stahl: $400,000 you?re giving up.
Donald Trump: No, I?m not gonna take the salary. I?m not taking it.
In a moment, the Trump children join us and we will ask the president-elect where he stands on gay marriage, Obamacare, and ISIS.
On Tuesday, Donald Trump reached deep into America?s ranks of the discouraged and neglected, a largely white constituency. They feel their America hasn?t been great for a long time. And they accepted a promise to make it great again.
But Mr. Trump?s appeal wasn?t just to the disaffected. A map on election night was a sea of red, as he won support across the traditionally Republican South, but also deep into what used to be the blue wall of the Midwest.
Hillary Clinton came up short among her own supporters in large cities and affluent suburbs, among minorities and especially women. Just 51 percent of college-educated white women voted to make her the first female president. Her base didn?t come with the enthusiasm and the turnout she needed to fend off Donald Trump?s new and energized coalition.
On Friday Mr. Trump?s four older children ? Tiffany, Donald, Jr., Eric And Ivanka -- joined us to talk about their father?s surprising victory.
Lesley Stahl: Set the scene. It?s election night. Your father-- no one?s expecting him to win and it begins to dawn on you. Tell us about being in that room.
Eric Trump: You start to see the states falling. You start seeing Florida come in and he was declared the winner. And then you saw Ohio, you saw North Carolina. You saw Pennsylvania. You saw Wisconsin. I mean, you saw all these great states ? they?re all falling. And I think it was when we got Pennsylvania that we knew. And it was amazing. We were high fiving and we were all hugging as a family. And I actually think our father was the calmest of all of us even though he was really obviously the center of attention. So--
Lesley Stahl: He went quiet is what I heard.
Eric Trump: --it?s-- it?s--
Lesley Stahl: --is what I heard.
Eric Trump: --it?s a moment I?ll never forget, I can tell you that. I mean, the team was around and everybody?s cheering. And it was just-- it was-- it was a beautiful night.
Ivanka Trump: It is hard to put into words the experience or the emotion when your father becomes president of the United States of America. We had enormous pride, joy. It?s incredibly exciting. And we?re very grateful for the opportunity. And we take that opportunity very seriously.
Lesley Stahl: Tiffany?
Tiffany Trump: I mean I don?t think we can really prepare for our father becoming president. But we were all there together with everyone that?s worked so hard. And my dad has worked so hard. And it?s just ? it?s really awe-inspiring.
At some point that night and into the next day, calls from well-wishers started pouring in ? including, Mr. Trump told us, from both ex-presidents Bush. Neither of whom supported him in the campaign.
Lesley Stahl: What did the b=Bushes say when they called you?
Donald Trump: Well, it was very interesting. I got a call from Father Bush, who is a wonderful man. And he just said, ?Congratulations. It",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

November 14, CJ Polychroniou : Noam, the unthinkable has happened: in contrast to all forecasts, Donald Trump scored a decisive victory over Hillary Clinton and the man that Michael Moore described as ?wretched, ignorant, dangerous part-time clown and full-time sociopath? is the next president of the United States. In your view, what were the deciding factors that led American voters produce the biggest upset in the history of US politics?
Noam Chomsky : Before turning to this question, I think it is important to spend a few moments pondering just what happened on November 8, a date that might turn out to be one of the most important in human history, depending on how we react.
No exaggeration.
The most important news of November 8 was barely noted, a fact of some significance in itself.
On November 8, the World Meteorological Organization delivered a report at the international conference on climate change in Morocco, COP22, which was called in order to carry forward the Paris agreements of COP21. The WMO reported that the past five years were the hottest on record. It reported rising sea levels, soon to increase as a result of the unexpectedly rapid melting of polar ice, most ominously the huge Antarctic glaciers. Already Arctic sea ice over the past five years is 28 percent below the average of the previous 29 years, not only raising sea levels but also reducing the cooling effect of polar ice reflection of solar rays, thereby accelerating the grim effects of global warming. The WMO reported further that temperatures are approaching dangerously close to the goal established by COP21, along with other dire reports and forecasts.
Another event took place on November 8, which also may turn out to be of unusual historical significance for reasons that, once again, were barely noted.
On November 8, the most powerful country in world history, which will set its stamp on what comes next, had an election. The outcome placed total control of the government ? the executive, Congress, the Supreme Court ? in the hands of the Republican Party, the most dangerous organization in world history.
Apart from the last phrase, all of this is uncontroversial. The last phrase may seem outlandish, even outrageous. But is it? The facts suggest otherwise. The Party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life. There is no historical precedent for such a stand.
Is this an exaggeration? Consider what we have just been witnessing.
During the Republican primaries, every candidate denied that what is happening is happening ? with the exception of the sensible moderates, like Jeb Bush, who said it?s all uncertain but we don?t have to do anything because we?re producing more natural gas, thanks to fracking. Or John Kasich, who agreed that global warming is taking place but added that ?we are going to burn [coal] in Ohio and we are not going to apologize for it.? The winning candidate, now the President-elect, calls for rapid increase in use of fossil fuels, including coal; dismantling of regulations; rejection of help to developing countries that are seeking to move to sustainable energy; and in general racing to the cliff as fast as possible.
Trump has already taken steps to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency by placing in charge of the EPA transition a notorious (and proud) climate change denier, Myron Ebell. Trump?s top adviser on energy, billionaire oil executive Harold Hamm, announced his expectations, which were predictable: dismantling regulations, tax cuts for the industry (and the wealthy and corporate sector generally), more fossil fuel production, lifting Obama?s temporary block on the Dakota Access pipeline. The market reacted quickly. Shares in energy corporations boomed, including the world?s largest coal miner, Peabody Energy, which had filed for bankruptcy, but after Trump?s victory registered a 50% gain.
The effects of Republican denialism had already been felt. There had been hopes that the COP21 Paris agreement would lead to a verifiable treaty, but any such thoughts were abandoned because the Republican Congress would not accept any binding commitments, so what emerged was a voluntary agreement, evidently much weaker.
Effects may soon become even more vividly apparent than they already are. In Bangladesh alone, tens of millions are expected to have to flee from low-lying plains in coming years because of sea level rise and more severe weather, creating a migrant crisis that will make today?s pale into insignificance. With considerable justice, Bangladesh?s leading climate scientist says that ?These migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming. Millions should be able to go to the United States.? And to the other rich countries that have grown wealthy while bringing about a new geological era, the Anthropocene, marked by radical human transformation of the environment. These catastrophic consequences can only increase, not just in Bangladesh but in all of South Asia as temperatures, already intolerable for the poor, inexorably rise and the Himalayan glaciers melt, threatening the entire water supply. Already in India some 300 million people are reported to lack drinking water. And the effects will reach far beyond.
It is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history ? whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know ? and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster. Similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human survival, the threat of nuclear destruction that has been looming over our heads for 70 years, and is now increasing.
It is no less difficult to find words to capture the utterly astonishing fact that in all of the massive coverage of the electoral extravaganza, none of this receives more than passing mention. At least I am at a loss to find appropriate words.
Turning finally to the question raised, to be precise it appears that Clinton received a slight majority of the vote. The apparent decisive victory has to do with curious features of American politics: among other factors, the electoral college residue of the founding of the country as an alliance of separate states; the winner-take-all system in each state; arrangement of congressional districts (sometimes by gerrymandering) to provide greater weight to rural votes (in past elections, probably this one too, Democrats have had a comfortable margin of victory in popular vote for the House but hold a minority of seats); the very high rate of abstention (usually close to half in presidential elections, this one too). Of some significance for the future is the fact that in the 18-25 range, Clinton won handily, and Sanders had an even higher level of support. How much this matters depends on what kind of future humanity will face.
According to current information, Trump broke all records in the support he received from white voters, working class and lower middle class, particularly in the $50,000 to $90,000 income range, rural and suburban, primarily those without college education. These groups share the anger throughout the West at the centrist establishment, revealed as well in the unanticipated Brexit vote and the collapse of centrist parties in continental Europe. The angry and disaffected are victims of the neoliberal policies of the past generation, the policies described in congressional testimony by Fed chair Alan Greenspan ? St. Alan as he was called reverentially by the economics profession and other admirers until the miraculous economy he was supervising crashed in 2007-8, threatening to bring the whole world economy down with it. As Greenspan explained during his glory days, his successes in economic management were based substantially on ?growing worker insecurity.? Intimidated working people would not ask for higher wages, benefits, and security but would be satisfied with the stagnating wages and reduced benefits that signal a healthy economy by neoliberal standards.
Working people who have been the subjects of these experiments in economic theory are, oddly, not particularly happy about the outcome. They are not, for example, overjoyed at the fact that in 2007, at the peak of the neoliberal miracle, real wages for non-supervisory workers were lower than they had been years earlier, or that real wages for male workers are about at 1960s levels while spectacular gains have gone to the pockets of a very few at the top, disproportionately a fraction of 1%. Not the result of market forces, achievement, or merit, but rather of definite policy decisions, matters reviewed carefully by economist Dean Baker in recently published work.
The fate of the minimum wage illustrates what has been happening. Through the periods of high and egalitarian growth in the ?50s and ?60s, the minimum wage ? which sets a floor for other wages ? tracked productivity. That ended with the onset of neoliberal doctrine. Since then the minimum wage has stagnated (in real value). Had it continued as before, it would probably be close to $20 per hour. Today it is considered a political revolution to raise it to $15.
With all the talk of near-full employment today, labor force participation remains below the earlier norm. And for a working man, there is a great difference between a steady job in manufacturing with union wages and benefits, as in earlier years, and a temporary job with little security in some service profession. Apart from wages, benefits, and security, there is a loss of dignity, of hope for the future, of a sense that this is a world in which I belong and play a worthwhile role.
The impact is captured well in Arlie Hochschild?s sensitive and illuminating portrayal of a Trump stronghold in Louisiana, where she lived and worked for many years. She uses the image of a line in which these people are standing, expecting to move forward steadily as they work hard and keep to all the conventional values. But their position in the line has stalled. Ahead of them, they see people leaping forward, but that does not cause much distress, because it is ?the American way? for (alleged) merit to be rewarded. What does cause real distress is what is happening behind them. Undeserving people who do not follow the rules are being moved in front of them by federal government programs designed to benefit African-Americans, immigrants, and others they often regard with contempt. All of this is exacerbated by Reagan?s racist fabrications about strapping young bucks and welfare queens (by implication Black) stealing your hard-earned money, and other fantasies ? which are sometimes tinged with shreds of reality, as is usually the case with ugly and dangerous concoctions designed to deflect attention from the real agents of distress to easy scapegoats.
Sometimes failure to explain, itself a form of contempt, plays a role. I once met a house painter in Boston who had turned bitterly against the evil government after a Washington bureaucrat who knew nothing about painting organized a meeting of painting contractors to inform them that they could no longer use lead paint, the only kind that works, as they all knew but the suit didn?t understand. That destroyed his small business, compelling him to paint houses on his own with substandard stuff forced on him by government elites. Sometimes there are also some reasons. Hochschild describes a man whose family and friends are suffering bitterly from the lethal effects of chemical pollution but who despises the government, and the ?liberal elites,? because for him, the EPA means some ignorant guy who tells him he can?t fish but does nothing about the chemical plants.
These are just samples of the real lives of Trump supporters, who are deluded to believe that Trump will do something to remedy their plight, though the merest look at his fiscal and other proposals demonstrates the opposite ? posing a task for activists who hope to fend off the worst and to advance desperately needed changes.
Exit polls reveal that the passionate support for Trump was inspired primarily by the belief that he represented change, while Clinton was perceived as the candidate who would perpetuate their distress. The ?change? that Trump is likely to bring will be harmful or worse, but it is understandable that the consequences are not clear to isolated people in an atomized society lacking the kinds of associations (like unions) that can educate and organize. That is a crucial difference between today?s despair and the generally hopeful attitudes of many working people under much greater duress during the great depression of the 1930s.
There are other factors in Trump?s success. Comparative studies show that doctrines of White Supremacy have had an even more powerful grip on American culture than in South Africa, and it?s no secret that the white population is declining. In a decade or two whites are projected to be a minority of the work force, and not too much later a minority of the population. The traditional conservative culture is also perceived as under attack by the successes of ?identity politics,? regarded as the province of elites who have only contempt for hard-working patriotic church-going Americans with real family values whose country is disappearing before their eyes.
It is worth remembering that before World War II, though it had long been the richest country in the world, the US was not a major player in global affairs and was also something of a cultural backwater. Someone who wanted to study physics would go to Germany. An aspiring writer or artist would go to Paris. That changed radically with World War II, for obvious reasons, but only for part of the population. Much remained culturally traditional. To mention one example of great significance, one of the difficulties in raising public concern over the very severe threats of global warming is that 40% of the population do not see why it is a problem, since Christ is returning in a few decades. About the same percentage believe that the world was created a few thousand years ago. If science conflicts with the Bible, so much the worse for science. It would be hard to find an analogue in other societies.
The Democratic party abandoned any real concern for working people by the 1970s, and they have therefore been drawn to the ranks of their bitter class enemies, who at least pretend to speak their language ? Reagan?s folksy style with little jokes while eating jelly beans, W. Bush?s carefully cultivated image of a regular guy you could meet in a bar who loved to cut brush on the ranch in 100 degree heat and his probably faked mispronunciations (it?s unlikely that he talked like that at Yale), and now Trump, who gives voice to people with legitimate grievances who have lost not just jobs but also a sense of personal self-worth; and who rails against the government that they perceive as having undermined their lives (not without reason).
One of the great achievements of the doctrinal system has been to divert anger from the corporate sector to the government that implements the programs it designs, such as the highly protectionist corporate/investor rights agreements that are uniformly mis-described as ?free trade agreements? in the media and commentary. With all its flaws, the government is to some extent under popular influence and control, unlike the corporate sector. It is highly advantageous for the business world to foster hatred for pointy-headed government bureaucrats and to drive out of people?s minds the subversive idea that the government might become an instrument of popular will, a government of, by, and for the people.
Is Trump representing a new movement in American politics, or was the outcome of this election primarily a rejection of Hillary Clinton by voters who hate the Clintons and are fed-up with ?politics as usual??
It?s by no means new. Both political parties have moved to the right during the neoliberal period. Today?s New Democrats are pretty much what used to be called ?moderate Republicans.? The ?political revolution? that Bernie Sanders called for, rightly, would not have greatly surprised Dwight Eisenhower. The Republicans have moved so far to dedication to the wealthy and the corporate sector that they cannot hope to get votes on their actual programs, and have turned to mobilizing sectors of the population that have always been there but not as an organized political force: evangelicals, nativists, racists, and the victims of the forms of globalization designed to set working people around the world in competition with one another while protecting the privileged and undermining the legal and other measures that provided working people with some protection and with ways to influence decision-making in the closely linked public and private sectors, notably with effective labor unions.
The consequences have been evident in recent Republican primaries. Every candidate that has emerged from the base ? Bachmann, Cain, Santorum, ? has been so extreme that the Republican establishment had to use its ample resources to beat them down. The difference in 2016 is that the establishment failed, much to its chagrin, as we have seen.
Deservedly or not, Clinton represented the policies that were feared and hated while Trump was seen as the symbol of ?change? ? change of what kind requires a careful look at his actual proposals, something largely missing in what reached the public. The campaign itself was remarkable in its avoidance of issues, and media commentary generally complied, keeping to the concept that true objectivity means reporting accurately what is ?within the beltway? but not venturing beyond.
Trump said following the outcome of the election that he ?will represent all Americans.? How is be going to do that when the nation is so divided and he has already expressed deep hatred for many groups in the United States, including women and minorities? Do you see any resemblance between Brexit and Donald Trump?s victory?
There are definite similarities to Brexit, and also to the rise of the ultranationalist far-right parties in Europe ? whose leaders were quick to congratulate Trump on his victory, perceiving him as one of their own: Farrage, Le Pen, Orban, and others like them. And these developments are quite frightening. A look at the polls in Austria and Germany ? Austria and Germany ? cannot fail to evoke unpleasant memories for those familiar with the 1930s, even more so for those who watched directly, as I did as a child. I can still recall listening to Hitler?s speeches, not understanding the words though the tone and audience reaction were chilling enough. The first article that I remember writing was in February 1939, after the fall of Barcelona, on the seemingly inexorable spread of the fascist plague. And by strange coincidence, it was in Barcelona that my wife and I watched Tuesday?s events.
As to how Trump will handle what he has brought forth ? not created, but brought forth ? we cannot say. Perhaps his most striking characteristic is unpredictability. A lot will depend on the reactions of those appalled by his performance and the visions he has projected, such as they are.
Trump has no identifiable political ideology guiding his stance on economic, social, and political issues, yet there are clear authoritarian tendencies in his behavior. Therefore, do you find any validity behind the claims that Trump may represent the emergence of ?fascism with a friendly face?? in the United States?
For many years I have been writing and speaking about the danger of the rise of an honest and charismatic ideologue in the United States, someone who could exploit the fear and anger that has long been boiling in much of the society, and who could direct it away from the actual agents of malaise to vulnerable targets. That could indeed lead to what sociologist Bertram Gross called ?friendly fascism? in a perceptive study 35 years ago. But that requires an honest ideologue, a Hitler type, not someone whose only detectable ideology is Me. The dangers however have been real for many years, perhaps even more so in the light of the forces that Trump has unleashed.
With the Republicans in the White House, but also controlling both houses and the future shape of the Supreme Court, what will America look like for at least the next four years?
A good deal depends on his appointments and circle of advisers. Early indications are unattractive, to put it mildly.
The Supreme Court will be in the hands of reactionaries for many years, with predictable consequences. If Trump follows through on his Paul Ryan-style fiscal programs, there will be huge benefits for the very rich ? estimated by the Tax Policy Center as a tax cut of over 14% for the top 0.1% and a substantial cut more generally at the upper end of the income scale, but with virtually no tax relief for others, who will also face major new burdens. The respected economics correspondent of the Financial Times, Martin Wolf, writes that ?The tax proposals would shower huge benefits on already rich Americans such as Mr Trump,? while leaving others in the lurch, including of course his popular constituency. The immediate reaction of the business world reveals that big pharma, Wall Street, military industry, energy industries, and other such wonderful institutions expect a very bright future.
One positive development might be the infrastructure program that Trump has promised while (along with much reporting and commentary) concealing the fact that it is essentially the Obama stimulus program that would have been of great benefit to the economy and to the society generally, but was killed by the Republican Congress on the pretext that it would explode the deficit. While that charge was spurious at the time, given the very low interest rates, it holds in spades for Trump?s program, now accompanied by radical tax cuts for the rich and corporate sector and increased Pentagon spending.
There is, however, an escape, provided by Dick Cheney when he explained to Bush?s Treasury Secretary Paul O?Neill that ?Reagan proved that deficits don?t matter? ? meaning deficits that we Republicans create in order to gain popular support, leaving it to someone else, preferably Democrats, to somehow clean up the mess. The technique might work, for a while at least.
There are also many questions about foreign policy consequences, mostly unanswered.
There is mutual admiration between Trump and Putin. How likely is it therefore that we may see a new era in US-Russia relations?
One hopeful prospect is that there might be reduction of the very dangerous and mounting tensions at the Russian border: note ?the Russian border,? not the Mexican border. Thereby lies a tale that we cannot go into here. It is also possible that Europe might distance itself from Trump?s America, as already suggested by Chancellor Merkel and other European leaders ? and from the British voice of American power, after Brexit. That might possibly lead to European efforts to defuse the tensions, and perhaps even efforts to move towards something like Mikhail Gorbachev?s vision of an integrated Eurasian security system without military alliances, rejected by the US in favor of NATO expansion, a vision revived recently by Putin, whether seriously or not we do not know since the gesture was dismissed.
Is US foreign policy under a Trump administration likely to be more or less militaristic than what we have seen under the Obama or even the G.W. Bush administrations?
I don?t think one can answer with any confidence. Trump is too unpredictable. There are too many open questions. What we can say is that popular mobilization and activism, properly organized and conducted, can make a large difference.
And we should bear in mind that the stakes are very large, as I remarked at the outset.",english,2016-11-15T00:55:37.766+02:00,informationclearinghouse.info,US,82758,Trump in the White House    : Information,0.347,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

GOP nominee Donald Trump took time out of a relentless campaign schedule Wednesday to spend around an hour opening a new hotel, prompting one CNN reporter to accuse Trump of ¡°taking time out of swing states.¡± Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is again nowhere to be seen. 
CNN¡¯s Dana Bash suggested that Trump should be more concerned with campaigning in swing states, yet Trump had three campaign stops scheduled for the same day. Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising?Donald Trump: ¡°No, not at all¡± https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r 
¡ª CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 
¡°So to people who say you¡¯re taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?¡± Bash asked. 
¡°I say the following: You have been covering me for the last ¡ª long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I¡¯ve been doing this for weeks straight,¡± Trump responded. 
¡°For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you¡¯ll ask me that question. I think that¡¯s a very rude question, to be honest with you.¡± Trump exclaimed. 
Trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule, suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit. 
While CNN has continuously run defense for Hillary Clinton amid a myriad of scandals, and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates, the network has been forced to admit that Hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule. 
Last month, for example, Hillary went six days without an event except for a short speech she gave in Orlando, Florida. 
And in August, Hillary took seven of the first 14 days of the month off and even went four days without a single campaign appearance. 
¡°Her speeches are so short ¨C they don¡¯t last long, they¡¯re like 10 minutes and ¡®let¡¯s get out of here,¡¯¡± Donald Trump said about her schedule. ¡°Go back home and go to sleep.¡± NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

GOP Nominee Donald Trump, who has for weeks warned that the election could be rigged against him, shot out a tweet Thursday indicating that he is aware of reports of machines ¡®flipping¡¯ to register votes for Hillary Clinton, when voters choose Trump. 
¡°A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas,¡± Trump tweeted. 
¡°People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?¡± A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on? 
¡ª Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2016 
As Infowars has highlighted , there have already been numerous reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. 
While election officials have dismissed the reports, suggesting ¡®user error¡¯ is to blame, tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time. 
Larry Norden, a voting technology expert, told NPR that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed. 
¡°Over time, as people vote, that calibration becomes less and less accurate,¡± Norden noted. 
During elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines ¡®flipping¡¯. Indeed, the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as The Simpsons drew attention to it: 
Meanwhile, The Washington Post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression, bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering Trump¡¯s ¡®rigged¡¯ election claims. 
Callum Borchers, author at the Washington Post blog The Fix writes: Since the final presidential debate last week, many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to Donald Trump supporters: Your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election Nov. 8. A day later, the Times¡¯s Upshot blog increased Clinton¡¯s chances of winning to 93 percent , an all-time high. On Monday, Politico¡¯s Ben Schreckinger wrote that ¡° Donald Trump¡¯s path to an election night win is almost entirely closed .¡± Here at The Fix, Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake wrote that ¡° Donald Trump¡¯s chances of winning are approaching zero .¡± These are accurate, statistically sound statements. But they are something else, too. Declarations that Trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the Republican nominee¡¯s warning that the ¡°rigged¡± election could be ¡° stolen from us .¡± 
The latest polls, which Trump insists are rigged due to oversampling, show Clinton with a double digit lead. 
However, Hillary Clinton¡¯s campaign manager Robby Mook has warned that Trump¡¯s suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are ¡°absolutely right.¡± 
¡°We¡¯ve seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before Election Day.¡± Mook said, urging Clinton supporters to vote. 
¡°Make no mistake. With only 10 percent of votes cast, Donald Trump could win this election,¡± Mook said.

NEW YORK CITY, New York ¡ª Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has closed the gap with his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton with just a couple weeks left in the election, the latest national Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing poll shows. 
Clinton, at 46 percent, leads Trump at 45 percent by just one point¡ªinside the survey¡¯s 2.3 percent margin of error. Libertarian Gary Johnson gets just 3 percent and the Green Party¡¯s Dr. Jill Stein just 1 percent, while 4 percent are unsure. The survey was conducted from Oct. 25 to Oct. 26, sampling 1,824 registered voters across the United States. The poll was conducted using a combination of interactive voice response polling and an internet panel of cell phone users. 
¡°Something has happened since the third debate,¡± Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, said of the poll. ¡°Conventional wisdom was after Trump said he wouldn¡¯t promise to accept the results of the election and made the ¡®nasty woman¡¯ comment, many thought Hillary would gain¡ªbut Trump seems to be closing the gap. In every election in the last 30 years, this happens where the person behind closes the gap. Hillary still has a clear electoral advantage and many paths to victory. However, Trump is not out of it but Hillary is still the favorite.¡± 
¡°This is a big story because it shows Trump really closing, importantly, as the other close polls are showing,¡± Democratic pollster Pat Caddell, who worked for President Jimmy Carter and is working with Breitbart News and Gravis Marketing on these polls, added. ¡°He is closing with his favorability and unfavorability as well. 
Caddell said he thinks Obamacare¡¯s failures, where premiums are skyrocketing, is one of many reasons why Trump is surging. ¡°Among other things, that is contributing [to Trump¡¯s rise in the polls],¡± Caddell said. ¡°When we are looking down the road at other things that may be influential, we are seeing the possibility of again on the immigration issue¡ªthat thing about concern on the border seems to be increasing as is opposition to Hillary and their plans to expand immigration and refugees, which is another big issue. But more importantly, at the end of the survey, we see both candidates have problems on their ability to unite the country and on whether or not they can have the moral leadership to lead. They¡¯re basically about the same, which I consider a real improvement for Trump now that he¡¯s that close.¡±",english,2016-10-28T15:51:13.562+03:00,infowars.com,US,2774,Statistical Tie: Latest Breitbart/Gravis Poll Shows Donald Trump Closes the Gap with Less Than Two Weeks Left,0,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/trump-stamina-clinton-hillary1.jpg,0,1,116,0,116,conspiracy,Negative

¡ª Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) October 28, 2016 Noting that she had seen reports on the news of votes being flipped, the woman said, ¡°I went in and voted a straight Republican ticket and thank God I went back and checked and they had switched my vote from Trump to (Hillary).¡± She said that she had to get the vote changed back by alerting election officials, who simply told her to vote for a second time. ¡°I went back the second time and made sure they didn¡¯t change it,¡± she concluded. As we reported earlier this week, voters in numerous areas of Texas have made a series of complaints that votes are being switched from Trump to Clinton. One election official responded by claiming the problems were caused by voters not understanding how to use the machines properly. ¡°Typically, we¡¯ve found it¡¯s voter error with the equipment,¡± Frank Phillips, Tarrant County¡¯s election administrator, told WFAA . ¡°Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates ¡­ or do something with the wheel¡­.There is not an issue with the equipment.¡± However, Trump supporters continue to point to the reports as evidence that vote fraud may be taking place.

Alex Jones breaks down the FBI¡¯s Friday announcement on the reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s private email server as new evidence surfaces. 
The new data was reportedly uncovered during a separate investigation into Anthony Weiner ¨C the husband of Clinton ally Huma Abedin. 
FBI Director James Comey cited ¡°recent developments¡± for the bureau¡¯s decision in a letter to committees and lawmakers today. 
¡°In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton¡¯s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,¡± Comey wrote. 
¡°In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.

In an amusing twist, Julian Assange whose Wikileaks has now had 20 individual releases of hacked John Podesta emails over the past three weeks and who has been accused by Hillary Clinton of collaborating with the Russians in an attempt to disrupt and subvert the US electoral process, accused the Clinton campaign of attacking the servers used by WikiLeaks. Speaking via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday, RT reported that Assange claimed the daily email release ritual has ¡°whipped up a crazed hornet¡¯s nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign¡± leading them to attack WikiLeaks. 
¡°They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile,¡± he added. 
Assange described Ecuador¡¯s decision to shut down his internet for the duration of the presidential campaign as a ¡°strategic position¡± so that its ¡°policy of non-intervention can¡¯t be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador.¡± He said he was sympathetic with Ecuador, insisting they face the dilemma of having the US interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the US elections next month. He also said that he did not agree with Ecuador¡¯s decision but did understand it. WikiLeaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from Ecuador, he said. 
He did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming, ¡°this is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process ¨C for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform.¡± It will, of course, be spun as interference if Hillary were to lose as the tables would then be turned, and instead of Trump slamming the ¡°rigged¡± elections, it will be Hillary who will demand a pound of flesh, perhaps literally. 
Assange did not stop there and also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being ¡°controlled by Clinton supporters.¡± If there is anything the Podesta emails have revealed, it is that he is correct in his assessment .",english,2016-10-28T14:57:26.571+03:00,intellihub.com,US,,"Assange predicts Trump will lose, accuses Clinton Campaign of trying to hack Wikileaks",0,https://www.intellihub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/13578225845_500e6f7a37_k.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Trump accepted the Presidency of the United States like a true gentlemen, even thanking Hillary Clinton for her long-winded service to the country. 
¡°Now it¡¯s time for America to bind the wounds of division. [¡­] It is time for us to come together as one united people.,¡± Trump said. 
Trump also reached out to those who chose not to support him in the past for their ¡°guidance and help¡± to make America great again. 
¡°It¡¯s a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will.¡± 
[¡­] 
¡°Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I¡¯ve spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country,¡± Trump said. 
¡°We must reclaim our country¡¯s destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We¡¯re going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again.¡± 
At a victory party Trump supporters could be heard chanting ¡°lock her up, lock her up [¡­],¡± Tom Llamas told ABC News, pointing out that Hillary Clinton¡¯s problems may not be over just yet. Not to mention how such rhetoric infuriated liberals nationwide. Chants of ¡°LOCK HER UP!¡± at Trump party raise the necessary Q: Will Trump appoint a special prosecutor to take on Clinton, as promised?

As the night went on most mainstream figureheads and pundits went into panic mode as the results started to flip, showing overwhelming favor of Trump. They just couldn¡¯t figure out how or why Mr. Trump won. It¡¯s as if they actually believed their masters fake polls that they were airing the entire race. 
Let me also mention that in many documented cases, people who voted ¡®all Republican¡¯ across the board had issues at the polls with the machines actually switching their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. Interestingly enough, despite the fact that a number of Soros deployed voting machines were likely rigged, Trump still won with some lead.

It makes you wonder what the actual numbers were. In fact they probably were consistent with many Intellihub polls which have shown Trump vs. Clinton at an 60/40 to and 80/20 split, like the following poll taken on Election Day which shows Trump at 62% over Hillary¡¯s 33. 
We are in the midnight hour #ElectionDay , who will win 
¡ª Shepard Ambellas (@ShepardAmbellas) November 8, 2016 
It was also noted by an analyst friend of mine that the Hillary campaign likely was devastated by what they thought was going to be a guaranteed victory and that we will likely see some corrupt politicians flee Washington D.C., like ¡®rats in the streets.¡¯ 
Then we have to contend with the fact that Trump does not take office until Jan. 20, 2017, which may give the rats in D.C. enough time to conduct a counter strike on the Trump campaign. Will Obama go quietly into the night? 
The short and simple answer is: no, he will not. At minimum we can expect more executive orders and the pardoning of connected individuals on his way out. Not to mention that Obama likely has a trick up his sleeve. 
There is always a ¡®Plan B,¡¯ which is essentially orchestrated chaos which would allow Obama to then suspend Trump¡¯s inauguration. In fact, all that Obama needs to make it happen, legally, through executive order, would be for a crisis of some type to occur in between now and the inauguration ¡ª it¡¯s that simple. 
Even an ¡®act of God,¡¯ such as a ¡® devastating space weather event ¡® could trigger such action and may. 
We can also expect pockets of unrest, especially in major cities. 
The bottom line is: the elites do not want to loose their power and are not going to wait another four years to regain it.

All across the country, the election of Donald Trump is being protested with increasing fervor. Despite all odds ( since all the public odds were rigged ) Trump¡¯s sweeping win of the electoral vote was a stunning blow to Hillary Clinton supporters. 
And they aren¡¯t taking their loss gracefully. They¡¯re shouting, swearing, crying, and, according to the most frequent word I¡¯ve seen, absolutely terrified. They seem unaware of the irony that when they refer to Trump as a fascist, they¡¯re actually the ones protesting a legitimately elected leader simply because their candidate didn¡¯t win. 
Protests began last night within hours of the announcement . 
The First Amendment guarantees our right to peaceful assembly , but that isn¡¯t what is happening. Injuries, obstruction of roadways, and destruction of property have begun to occur, and I strongly believe the violence will continue to escalate.

Adding his voice to the chorus of condemnation heaped on the Democratic Party in the wake of Donald Trump¡¯s election victory, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday attributed the Republican win to the failure of the liberal elite to represent working people. 
¡°It is an embarrassment, I think, to the entire of [the] Democratic Party that millions of white working-class people decided to vote for Mr. Trump, which suggests that the Democratic message of standing up for working people no longer holds much sway among workers in this country,¡± the progressive senator and one-time presidential candidate told the Associated Press . 
¡°You cannot be a party which on one hand says we¡¯re in favor of working people, we¡¯re in favor of the needs of young people but we don¡¯t quite have the courage to take on Wall Street and the billionaire class,¡± he continued. ¡°People do not believe that. You¡¯ve got to decide which side you¡¯re on.¡± 
Sanders¡ªwho, according to hypothetical polls conducted during the primary, would have posed a more formidable challenge to Trump than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton¡ªtold the news outlet that he is ¡°not ruling out¡± another presidential bid in 2020. But, the 75-year-old senator from Vermont said that, for now, he is focused on rebuilding the party. 
Among the potential changes to be made, Sanders told AP that he would recommend Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) to lead the Democratic National Committee (DNC), a position that Ellison has been reportedly vying for. 
The interview comes one day after Sanders issued a statement saying he is prepared to work with the president-elect ¡°[t]o the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country.¡± 
But, the senator indicated on Thursday he did not think that would be likely. ¡°I hope I¡¯m wrong, but I believe that he is a fraud, and I think despite all of his rhetoric about being a champion of the working class, it will turn out to be hollow,¡± Sanders said. 
In an appearance on CNN late Thursday afternoon, when asked if he could have beaten Trump , Sanders said, ¡°What good does it do now?¡±",english,2016-11-11T20:14:29.478+02:00,intellihub.com,US,,"Trump won because Democratic Party failed working people, says Sanders",0,https://www.intellihub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bernie-sanders-questions.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

WASHINGTON D.C. ( INTELLIHUB ) ¡ª The Establishment elite are in panic mode after their rigged elections backfired in their face when vast seas of patriotic Americans took to the polls in favor of Donald J. Trump, giving America¡¯s new President-elect the electoral votes needed to win. 
Last Thursday, during a meeting held at the White House, between Donald Trump and President Barack Obama, you could just see how irked Obama was knowing that he was sitting beside a truly patriotic soul; a man with a raging fire burning inside him; a man with the spirit to facilitate making America great again.

¡ª Shepard Ambellas (@ShepardAmbellas) November 12, 2016 
In fact, during the meeting Obama was so threatened by Trump¡¯s presence that his 8-year-long legacy likely flashed before his very eyes as the President of the United States realized that on day number one of Donald Trump¡¯s presidency, a president Trump, at that point, could simply nullify any and all executive orders signed by the then would-be former president Barack Obama during his tenure as POTUS .

Sure does.

Fibonacci Blue/Flickr Does that mean the repeal of Obamacare or major failed portions of it? 
Yes it does. Does that mean the preservation of our civil rights and liberties per the Constitution? 
Sure does. Does that mean implementing a sensible immigration policy; possibly building a wall? 
Yes it does. After all, the Russians are now using advanced killer robots at their border, ones that can engage and kill humans from over 6 miles away. Nancy <I¡¯m gonna SNAP!/Flickr Does that mean putting an end to dangerous geoengineering programs that our affecting all living things on the planet and our weather? 
One can only hope. 
But you can see where I am going with this. The Establishment elite simply do not want to lose their power and in my opinion will likely do anything to keep it. Remember, they have built a legacy and plan to protect it at all costs. 
So in other words; will Donald Trump actually take office against all odds?

If Donald Trump truly wants to fix the economy, he must shut down the Federal Reserve. If he just tries to patch up our current system, he will fail, because it has been fundamentally flawed from the very beginning. A little over a century ago, very powerful forces on Wall Street convinced Congress to completely restructure our financial system. An immensely powerful central bank known as the Federal Reserve was created, and the goal was to transform the U.S. dollar into a debt-based currency that would continuously be inflated and to create an endless debt spiral from which the federal government could never possibly escape. Sadly, they were successful on both counts. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve, the value of the U.S. dollar has declined by approximately 98 percent and our national debt has gotten more than 5000 times larger . 
Americans tend to give most of the credit or most of the blame for the performance of the U.S. economy to our presidents, but the truth is that an unelected, unaccountable group of central bankers has far more power over our economy than anyone else does. The Federal Reserve has become known as ¡° the fourth branch of government ¡°, but unlike the other branches of government we are told that the Fed¡¯s decisions are ¡°above politics¡± because they are ¡°too important¡±. Fed officials fiercely guard their ¡°independence¡±, and they fiercely resist any ¡°interference¡± from Congress, the President, or the American people. 
Donald Trump can try to lower taxes and reduce regulations, but what he will be able to do to influence the economy pales in comparison to the immensely powerful tools that the Fed wields. The Fed controls interest rates, the Fed controls the money supply, and the Fed regulates the banks. 
To give you an idea of how enormously powerful the Fed is, I want you to pull out a dollar bill. 
As you look at that dollar bill, I want you to notice that it says ¡°Federal Reserve Note¡± right at the top. 
In the financial world, a ¡°note¡± is an instrument of debt, and the truth is that our system was designed to create as much debt as possible. 
So why are we using debt-based ¡°Federal Reserve Notes¡± in the first place? Shouldn¡¯t Congress have control over our currency? 
According to Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution , it is Congress that has the authority to ¡°coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures¡±. 
So how did the Fed get involved? 
Well, it is a very long and convoluted story, and if you are interested in the history behind it I would commend to you an excellent book by C. Edward Griffin entitled ¡° The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve ¡°. Basically, big money interests on Wall Street got their hooks into the White House and Congress, and they rushed through legislation right before Christmas in 1913 that created this insidious central banking system that was designed to slowly but surely take wealth from the American people and put it into their hands. 
Sadly, most Americans don¡¯t even realize that we have a debt-based currency, nor do they understand where our money comes from. In a previous article , I discussed how money is normally created by the Federal Reserve under our current system¡­ 
When the U.S. government decides that it wants to spend another billion dollars that it does not have, it does not print up a billion dollars. 
Rather, the U.S. government creates a bunch of U.S. Treasury bonds (debt) and takes them over to the Federal Reserve. 
The Federal Reserve creates a billion dollars out of thin air and exchanges them for the U.S. Treasury bonds. 
The Federal Reserve takes the U.S. Treasury bonds that it receives in exchange for the ¡°Federal Reserve Notes¡± that it gave to the government and it auctions off those bonds to the highest bidder . But of course this process always creates more debt than it does money¡­ The U.S. Treasury bonds that the Federal Reserve receives in exchange for the money it has created out of nothing are auctioned off through the Federal Reserve system. But wait. There is a problem. Because the U.S. government must pay interest on the Treasury bonds, the amount of debt that has been created by this transaction is greater than the amount of money that has been created. So where will the U.S. government get the money to pay that debt? Well, the theory is that we can get money to circulate through the economy really, really fast and tax it at a high enough rate that the government will be able to collect enough taxes to pay the debt. But that never actually happens, does it? And the creators of the Federal Reserve understood this as well. They understood that the U.S. government would not have enough money to both run the government and service the national debt. They knew that the U.S. government would have to keep borrowing even more money in an attempt to keep up with the game. 
So our debt just keeps going up and up and up. While Barack Obama has been in the White House our national debt has risen by more than 9 trillion dollars, and at this moment it is sitting just under the 20 trillion dollar mark . 
But we shouldn¡¯t be surprised by this, because this is precisely what the Federal Reserve system was designed to do to us. 
But we shouldn¡¯t be surprised by this, because this is precisely what the Federal Reserve system was designed to do to us. 
Many conservatives still hold to the mistaken illusion that we could somehow pay all of this debt back someday, but as I have shown in a previous article, this is mathematically impossible to do . 
If the government went out today and grabbed every single dollar in existence we could not pay back the national debt, and of course we have trillions of dollars of household debt, trillions of dollars of corporate debt and trillions of dollars of state and local government debt that we need to pay back as well. 
Under the current system our only hope is to keep the wheel spinning by continuing to devalue the dollar and by continuing to go into even greater amounts of debt. 
And of course it isn¡¯t just the United States that is in this predicament. At this point, almost every single nation on the entire planet has a central bank. 
Even though there are extremely sharp disagreements among nations on virtually everything else, somehow central banking has achieved nearly universal adoption. 
As you read this article, well over 99.9% of the population of the globe lives in a country that has a central bank. 
Do you think that is just a coincidence? 
Of course there are still a few very small countries such as the Federated States of Micronesia that do not have a central bank, but the only big nation not to have one is North Korea. 
And you would literally have to be insane to want to live in North Korea. 
But now we have an opportunity to get free from this insidious system. The truth is that we don¡¯t have to have a central bank. In fact, the greatest period of economic growth in U.S. history was when there was no central bank . 
We don¡¯t need central planners to set our interest rates and to manipulate our money supply. They will never admit this, but the reality of the matter is that their interference in the economy often creates tremendous economic busts. 
Since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, there have been 18 distinct recessions or depressions : 1918, 1920, 1923, 1926, 1929, 1937, 1945, 1949, 1953, 1958, 1960, 1969, 1973, 1980, 1981, 1990, 2001, 2008. 
Considering their track record, isn¡¯t it time for a change? 
And we don¡¯t have to have a debt-based currency. In fact, not too long ago we had a president that decided to start issuing debt-free ¡°United States Notes¡±. 
Back in 1963, President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110 which authorized the U.S. Treasury to issue debt-free ¡°United States Notes¡± which were directly created by the U.S. government. 
He was assassinated shortly thereafter. 
Most Americans don¡¯t realize this, but many of the debt-free United States Notes that were issued under President Kennedy are still in circulation today , and President Trump could do something similar. 
But will he? 
It has been said that the borrower is the servant of the lender, and the Federal Reserve system has turned all of us into debt slaves. 
Debt is a form of social control, and the global elite use all of this debt to dominate the planet. The total amount of debt in the world just hit a brand new record high of 152 trillion dollars , and the longer we allow the central banks to control the system the bigger this debt bubble will become.

The last time we encountered David Brock , Hillary Clinton¡¯s so called media ¡°attack dog¡±, was two months ago when we exposed a money laundering scheme involving over a dozen of his Pro-Clinton SuperPACs. Now, it appears that unable to concede defeat, the man who aligned his career with Hillary Clinton, is going for blood, and is soliciting the help, but mostly money, of Clinton¡¯s top donors. 
According to Politico , Brock is launching his own Koch-brothers-like donor network to finance attacks on President-elect Donald Trump and to rebuild the political left after Trump¡¯s stunning victory over Clinton last week. In an email sent out on Thursday night, Brock emailed more than 200 of the biggest donors on the left, including finance titans George Soros, Tom Steyer and Donald Sussman all of whom invested millions of dollars in Clinton¡¯s campaign with nothing to show for it, inviting them to a private retreat in Palm Beach during inauguration weekend to assess what Democrats did wrong in 2016, figure out how to correct it and raise cash for those initiatives. 
¡° This will be THE gathering for Democratic donors from across the country to hear from a broad and diverse group of leaders about the next steps for progressives under a Trump Administration ,¡± Brock wrote to the donors in an email. ¡°What better way to spend inaugural weekend than talking about how to kick Donald Trump¡¯s ass?¡± Brock said. The retreat, which is planned as the first in a series of regular gatherings, will feature appearances by an array of Democratic elected officials, operatives and liberal thinkers and group officials, Brock explained in an interview. 
While it is unclear how many of the addressed billionaires confirmed their presence at this ¡°secret¡± gathering, Brock predicted there would be significant interest, noting that the keynote address at his last major donor conference, back in 2013, was delivered by former President Bill Clinton. It is unclear how much Clinton received for one hours of his time. 
Brock is a self-described ¡°right-wing hitman-turned-Clinton enforcer ¡± who has used his relationships with some of the left¡¯s wealthiet supporters and billionaire donors to build an armada of aggressive political outfits that have become pillars of the institutional left and that raised a combined $65 million during the 2016 cycle. As profiled previously, Brock¡¯s groups include the conservative media monitoring non-profit Media Matters, the opposition research super PAC American Bridge and the legal watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. 
That¡¯s not all: other groups in his network include the liberal media-funding vehicle American Independent Institute, the media-training non-profit Franklin Forum and the for-profit social media operation ShareBlue, which The New York Times described as ¡°Hillary Clinton¡¯s Outrage Machine.¡± A seventh group, a super PAC called Correct the Record that was created to coordinate directly with Clinton¡¯s campaign , is winding down, though Brock said that a number of its functions and personnel likely will be absorbed by his other groups. 
And yet one wonders if Brock¡¯s attempt to square things up with Trump isn¡¯t too little, too late, especially for a many who like Huma Abedin, has been so closely associated with Hillary and her now defunct political career: Brock acknowledged in the interview: ¡°There is no question that we poured our heart and soul into this election for Hillary, but these institutions were built before her campaign and were intended to outlast it.¡± 
To separate himself from the Clintons whom he serves so well over the years, Brock said in his email to donors that he created Media Matters more than a decade ago to help the left push back during George W. Bush¡¯s presidency. 
¡°In 2005, we were part of a successful progressive effort to regroup, retool and recover,¡± he wrote. ¡°While today¡¯s situation is more dire, media matters more than ever.¡± 
But the biggest problem for Brock is that he is likely stepping on the very toes of those whose money he is after: as Politico notes, the Palm Beach retreat seems to be a challenge to the 12-year-old Democracy Alliance, a club of liberal financiers that was started by Soros and a handful of other major donors to fund the institutional left . In fact, the club, which held its annual winter meeting this week in Washington, helped launch Media Matters, and many of Brock¡¯s donors belong to its ranks. Brock said he¡¯s inviting the president of the DA, as the club is known, to his Palm Beach retreat. 
There is one way Brock¡¯s network hopes to differentiate itself: while the Democracy Alliance at its winter meeting discussed ways to push back on the Trump administration, many of the group¡¯s members have tried to train its focus on pressuring Democrats from the left on issues like fighting climate change, money in politics and drug laws; Brock however is more overtly and aggressively political, and has been ¡°largely agnostic on the philosophical divisions with which Democrats are grappling.¡± 
¡°We don¡¯t think of this as representing a faction of the Democratic Party, but a cross-section of it, so we¡¯re not going to precook things ideologically,¡± he said. ¡°It is very politically minded, and there is an urgency to it.¡± 
At this point two questions emerge: one of the main reasons why Clinton lost is precisely due to behind the scenes scheming such as this, where political ¡°attack dog¡± operatives would meet with billionaires and strategize how to shift public perception on any number of items. That has now been proven to be a losing strategy. Have the democrats truly not learned anything from their most shocking failure in history? 
The next question is just how much more ¡°overtly and aggressively political¡± will Brock, whose organizations have been alleged to be behind a number of the anti-Trump riots in recent months, be in his quest to take down, or rather ¡°kick the ass¡± of Donald Trump. Because if there is one thing that is so far missing from the most scandalous political election in recent history, it is an attempt to physically eliminate the president. We can only hope that the ¡°hitman-turned-Clinton enforcer¡± will not decide to go that far.",english,2016-11-18T17:59:02.643+02:00,intellihub.com,US,,"Hillary ¡°attack dog¡± David Brock plotting with Soros, Steyer, Sussman to ¡°kick Trump¡¯s ass¡±",0,https://www.intellihub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-05_2126-ff.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

It would be a grave mistake to understate the amount of damage that has been done to the U.S. economy over the past eight years. In this article, I am going to share some economic numbers with you that are extremely sobering. Anyone that takes a cold, hard, honest look at the numbers should be able to see that our economy is in terrible shape. Unfortunately, the way that we see things is often clouded by our political views. Up until the election, Democrats were far more likely then Republicans to believe that the economy was improving, but now that is in the process of completely reversing. According to Gallup , only 16 percent of Republicans believed that the economy was getting better before the election, but that number has suddenly jumped to 49 percent after Trump¡¯s election victory. And the percentage of Democrats that believe that the economy is getting better fell from 61 percent to 46 percent after the election. Here are some additional details from Gallup ¡­ After Trump won last week¡¯s election, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents now have a much more optimistic view of the U.S. economy¡¯s outlook than they did before the election. Just 16% of Republicans said the economy was getting better in the week before the election, while 81% said it was getting worse. Since the election, 49% say it is getting better and 44% worse. Conversely, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents¡¯ confidence in the economy plummeted after the election. Before the election, 61% of Democrats said the economy was getting better and 35% worse. Now, Democrats are evenly divided, with 46% saying it is getting better and 47% saying it is getting worse. 
The truth, of course, is that the result of the election did not somehow magically alter the outlook for the U.S. economy. 
We still have a giant mess on our hands, and the following are 11 very depressing economic realities that Donald Trump will inherit from Barack Obama¡­ 
#1 Nearly 7 out of every 10 Americans have less than $1,000 in savings . That means that about two-thirds of the country is essentially living paycheck to paycheck at this moment. 
#2 Reuters is reporting that U.S. mall investors are poised to lose ¡°billions¡± of dollars as the ¡° retail apocalypse ¡± in this nation deepens. 
#3 Credit card delinquencies have hit the highest level that we have seen since 2012 . 
#4 Approximately 35 percent of all Americans have a debt that is at least 180 days past due. 
#5 The rate of homeownership has fallen for eight years in a row and is now hovering near a 50 year low . 
#6 The total number of government employees now outnumbers the total number of manufacturing employees in this country by almost 10 million . 
#7 The number of homeless people in New York City (where Donald Trump is from) has hit a brand new record high . 
#8 About 20 percent of all young adults are currently living with their parents . 
#9 Total household debt in the United States has now reached a grand total of 12.3 trillion dollars . 
#10 The total amount of corporate debt in the U.S. has nearly doubled since the end of 2007. 
#11 When Barack Obama entered the White House, the U.S. government was 10.6 trillion dollars in debt. Today, the U.S. national debt is currently sitting at a staggering total of $19,842,173,949,869.58 . 
Despite nearly doubling the national debt during his eight years in the White House, Barack Obama is going to be the only president in United States history to never have a single year when U.S. GDP grew by at least three percent. 
So will Donald Trump waltz in and suddenly turn everything around? 
Just like when George W. Bush was elected, there is a lot of optimism about the future right now among Republicans. 
And in 2017, Republicans are going to have control of the Senate and the House in addition to being in control of the White House. 
But does that mean that they will actually get anything done? 
For a moment, let¡¯s review what didn¡¯t happen the last time the Republicans were in this position. The following is an extended excerpt from an article by author Devvy Kidd ¡­ ¡ª¨C The Republicans had control of both houses of Congress part of the time during Bush, Jr.¡¯s two terms. Did they lock down our borders? NO. Did they pass legislation to stop ALL funding for illegals which would self-deport millions of liars, cheats and thieves? NO. (READ, please: How to Self-Deport Millions of Illegals ) Did they stop trillions in unconstitutional spending? NO. Did they get rid of any of Clinton¡¯s unconstitutional Executive Orders? One or two but otherwise let Comrade Bill Clinton crap in our faces. Did they get rid of one unconstitutional cabinet like HHS, Department of Education and EPA? NO. Did they stop the unconstitutional foreign aid? NO. Did they stop unconstitutional spending for Planned Parenthood? NO. Congress just continues to use borrowed money to spend more debt. Did they stop unconstitutional spending for the gigantic hoax called global warming or climate change? NO. Trump: The Left Just Lost The War On Climate Change Did Bush, Jr., get us out of all the destructive trade treaties killing American jobs? NO. Did they crack down on visas bringing in tens of thousands of foreign workers when American workers who want to work are left in the unemployment line? NO. Did they stop more and more federal regulations strangling America¡¯s businesses? NO. Did they impeach one single activist judge destroying our freedom and liberty? NO. A Republican controlled Congress with a Republican in the White House and they did virtually NOTHING to restore America to a constitutional republic and constitutional spending. ¡ª¨C 
So will things be any different under a Trump administration? 
We shall see. 
There will be tremendous pressure to maintain the status quo in many instances, because the process of fixing things would undoubtedly make conditions worse in the short-term. 
A great example of this is the national debt. As I discussed yesterday , the only reason why we are able to enjoy such a massively inflated standard of living in this country is because we have been able to borrow trillions upon trillions of dollars from the rest of the world at ultra-low interest rates. 
If the federal government started spending only the money that it brought in through taxes, our ridiculous debt-fueled standard of living would begin collapsing immediately. 
We consume far more wealth than we produce, and the only way that we are able to do this is by borrowing insane amounts of money. 
Either Donald Trump will continue to borrow money recklessly, or we will go into a major league economic downturn. 
It really is that simple. 
But when our politicians borrow money, they are literally destroying the future of this country. So the choice is pain in the short-term or greater pain in the long-term. 
There is a way out, and that would involve shutting down the Federal Reserve and going to a completely debt-free form of money, but that is a topic for another article. 
And unfortunately that is not something that is even on Donald Trump¡¯s radar at this point. 
No matter who won the election, the next president was going to be faced with some very harsh economic realities. 
There are many out there that have faith that Donald Trump can pull off an unprecedented economic miracle, but there are others that are deeply skeptical. 
Let us hope for the best, but let us also keep preparing for the worst.",english,2016-11-18T17:59:05.757+02:00,intellihub.com,US,,11 very depressing economic realities that Donald Trump will inherit,0,https://www.intellihub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DonaldTrump.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration By Tyler Durden - 11.22.2016 @1:27 PM EST 
Just yesterday Trump called a summit of all the major mainstream media executives and anchors at Trump Tower. While many expected the meeting to be an oppotunity to ask questions of the president-elect, the media elites apparently got the surprise of their lives when Trump spent the majority of the meeting attacking they¡¯re blatant biased coverage the 2016 presidential elections referring to the room as a bunch of ¡°dishonest, deceitful liars.¡± One participant in the meeting described it as a ¡° f¡ªing firing squad ¡± after ¡° Trump started with Jeff Zucker and said ¡°I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed ¡­.¡± We suspect that was rather less cordial than they expected. 
Despite the conversation being completely off the record, many of the ¡°emotionally fucking pissed¡± media anchors have decided to blow their embargoes and lash out at Trump. According to one source interviewed by the New Yorker , the meeting at Trump Tower was ¡°fucking outrageous.¡± The same source also questioned how he could remain impartial after the meeting saying ¡° How can this not influence coverage?¡± ¡­yes, because coverage was so impartial up until yesterday. Another participant at the meeting said that Trump¡¯s behavior was ¡°totally inappropriate¡± and ¡°fucking outrageous.¡± The television people thought that they were being summoned to ask questions; Trump has not held a press conference since late July. Instead, they were subjected to a stream of insults and complaints¡ªand not everyone absorbed it with pleasure. ¡°I have to tell you, I am emotionally fucking pissed,¡± another participant said. ¡°How can this not influence coverage? I am being totally honest with you. Toward the end of the campaign, it got to a point where I thought that the coverage was all about [Trump¡¯s] flaws and problems. And that¡¯s legit. But, I thought, O.K., let¡¯s give them the benefit of the doubt. After the meeting today, though¡ªand I am being human with you here¡ªI think, Fuck him! I know I am being emotional about it. And I know I will get over it in a couple of days after Thanksgiving. But I really am offended. This was unprecedented. Outrageous!¡± Participants said that Trump did not raise his voice, but that he went on steadily at the start of the meeting about how he had been treated poorly. ¡°It was all so Trump,¡± one said. ¡°He is like this all the time. He¡¯ll freeze you out and then be nice and humble and sort of want you to like him.¡± ¡°But he truly doesn¡¯t seem to understand the First Amendment,¡± the source continued. ¡°He doesn¡¯t. He thinks we are supposed to say what he says and that¡¯s it.¡± 
And, as the eloquent Kellyanne Conway pointed out in her opening response last night on the Megyn Kelly show, negative reactions, like the one above, went a long way toward helping Trump win the presidency. 
What are the chances that the mainstream media figures out before 2020 that by relentlessly attacking Trump they¡¯re actually helping him? 
* * * 
Here is our full coverage of the Trump ¡°media summit¡± that was described by some as a ¡° f¡ªing firing squad¡±: 
Earlier today we reported that in a ¡°summit¡± organized by Trump¡¯s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, executives and anchors from the major US media outlets, including CNN president Jeff Zucker, ABC News president James Goldston, Fox News co-presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy, and NBC News president Deborah Turness, visited Donald Trump at his Trump Tower penthouse for an off the record meeting. 
Courtesy of the Post, we have a complete list of the participants at the Trump media meeting: the hour-long powwow included top execs from network and cable news channels. Among the attendees were NBC¡¯s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd, ABC¡¯s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz, CBS¡¯ Norah O¡¯Donnell John Dickerson, Charlie Rose, Christopher Isham and Gayle King, Fox News¡¯ Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott, MSNBC¡¯s Phil Griffin and CNN¡¯s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. 
The contents of what was discussed were initially unclear. 
Now, according to the Post and Politico , we learn that the President-elect ¡° exploded at media bigs in an off-the-record Trump Tower powow on Monday .¡± 
¡° It was like a f¡ªing firing squad ,¡± one source told the Post. 
According to the Post¡¯s recount of the conversation, ¡° Trump started with Jeff Zucker and said I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed ¡­.¡± 
¡°The meeting was a total disaster . The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down,¡± the source added. A second source confirmed the encounter. 
The Post adds that ¡°the meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks¡­¡± 
¡°Trump kept saying, ¡® We¡¯re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars . 
¡°Trump didn¡¯t say Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate ¨C which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room. 
¡°Gayle did not stand up, but asked some question, ¡®How do you propose we the media work with you?¡¯ Chuck Todd asked some pretty pointed questions. David Muir asked how are you going to cope living in DC while your family is in NYC? It was a horrible meeting.¡± 
Politico adds further details, according to which ¡°Trump complained about photos of himself that NBC used that he found unflattering, the source said. Trump turned to NBC News President Deborah Turness at one point, the source said, and told her the network won¡¯t run a nice picture of him, instead choosing ¡°this picture of me,¡± as he made a face with a double chin. Turness replied that they had a ¡°very nice¡± picture of him on their website at the moment.¡± 
Amusingly, since the meeting was off the record, meaning the participants agreed not to talk about the substance of the conversations, it means they will most likely be unable to confirm or deny the Post¡¯s report. 
Politco¡¯s recollection of events was slightly less dramatic: The New York Post on Monday afternoon portrayed a much more heated meeting, including a quote from one source who said the encounter was ¡°like a f¨Cing firing squad.¡± The Post also said Trump called CNN journalists ¡°liars¡± and that they should be ¡°ashamed.¡± The source who spoke with POLITICO characterized the meeting as less intense, and said the discussion included Trump expressing the possibility of a ¡°reset¡± of the tumultuous relationship between the president-elect and the media and that all he wants is ¡°fairness.¡± Asked how he defines fairness by a network executive, Trump said simply, ¡°The truth.¡± But aside from the few moments of contention in the beginning, the source said the meeting was largely substantive. 
Politico also adds that Trump, flanked by chief of staff Reince Priebus and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway at the table, also expressed annoyance at the protective press pool and the complaints over him ditching the press when he went out to dinner last week with his family after reporters were advised he was in for the night. But Priebus assured the attendees that the protective press pool will be taken care of and it would all work out. 
Other attendees at the meeting from Trump¡¯s team included chief strategist Stephen Bannon, Trump¡¯s son-in-law Jared Kushner, spokesman Jason Miller, and Republican National Committee chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer. Asked for comment, Miller referred POLITICO to Conway¡¯s comments to reporters after the meeting, in which she echoed the sentiments made in the meeting about turning over a new leaf with the media. ¡°There was no need to mend fences,¡± Conway said. ¡°It was very cordial, very genial. But it was very candid and very honest. From my own perspective, it¡¯s great to hit the reset button.¡± Conway later on Monday hit back at the New York Post report. ¡°He did not explode in anger,¡± she said. 
While one can have a subjective interpretation of the nuances at the meeting, one thing was clear: Trump¡¯s attempt at a ¡®reset¡¯ will be frowned at by the media which is not used to this kind of treatment, even if the ¡°kinder, gentler¡± version of events as reported by Politico is accurate. 
It also means that what has already been a conventional war between the various US media organizations and Trump, is likely about to go nuclear.",english,2016-11-23T00:34:57.385+02:00,intellihub.com,US,,¡°Emotionally f**king pissed¡± media blows embargo and lashes out at Trump ¨C ¡°f*ck him¡±,0,https://www.intellihub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trump-speaking-at-podium.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

It is a clich¨¦ by now that Donald Trump has run a reality show campaign¡ªa series of gaffes, surprises, outrages, weirdnesses, explosions, revelations, and just every other ingredient that comprise the popular TV genre of faux authenticity. On reality TV, the subjects are seldom artists or entertainers or high achievers in any field. They are personalities. Their roles are their lives, which creates a M?bius strip. What do the Kardashians actually do besides being on their show, which has, of course, generated all sorts of commercial opportunities that almost make it seem as if they are doing something? What is their talent, other than the talent for self-promotion? 
All of this was anticipated 54 years ago by historian Daniel Boorstin in The Image , in which he defined a celebrity as someone who is known for being well-known. In a previous post , I discussed how this applied to Trump, who seems a hollow man except for his fame. 
But I am not sure that Boorstin¡¯s tautology, clever as it is, is really accurate. I would submit that celebrity isn¡¯t a status, nor is it a media anointment. I think celebrity is actually a narrative form played out in the medium of life and then broadcast by the traditional and now social media. One earns celebrity¡ªto the extent that you can call it earned¡ªby keeping one¡¯s narrative going. You lose your celebrity not when you lose fame or attention, your well-known-ness, but when you lose your narrative, which is what got you the attention in the first place. 
Donald Trump is the first celebrity candidate in both Boorstin¡¯s sense and mine¡ªBoorstin¡¯s because Trump is less a builder of edifices than a slapper-of-his-name-on-other-people¡¯s edifices. He is literally known for being well-known. And in mine because Trump has spent the better part of his life providing narratives to the press to feed its insatiable appetite for gossip and his desire for attention. There are many ways in which Trump is a unique presidential aspirant, but chief among them may be this: He is the first candidate who ran for president to feed his celebrity. The entire campaign is a plot point¡ªa means to a larger end, which is not the presidency, but keeping his celebrity afloat. Relevance is an issue for all of us, but especially for a 70-year-old man who is accustomed to the spotlight. 
I thought of this when The New York Times ran two pieces this week. One was the first of a series based on interviews with Trump conducted by biographer Michael D¡¯Antonio and given to The Times by him. What the interviews reveal is that Trump¡¯s primary obsession is a fear of losing his fame. In the interviews Trump reviles Arsenio Hall , a former talk show host and one-time Celebrity Apprentice contestant . ¡°Dead as a doornail. Dead as dog meat,¡± Trump eulogized. 
The other article that struck me was one about how Trump used appearances on TV shows and in films 
As the Times piece about Trump¡¯s Hollywood connections tells it, he began talking about running for president as early as 1988. Why? Trump didn¡¯t have any overriding sense of national mission. He doesn¡¯t have one even now. Clearly, his ongoing, three-decades-long flirtation with the presidency was just a plot twist¡ªa way of juicing the narrative when it was flagging. In that sense, it was no different than his affair with Marla Maples, his feud with Rosie O¡¯Donnell, his nonstop lawsuits and everything else. The presidency was a publicity stunt. It still is. Viewed that way, nearly everything Trump does,

In her recent Washington Post Article , Jewish academic Cheryl Greenberg makes one valid observation. Trump¡¯s criticism of the Jews is far more subtle than his disapproval of other groups and identities (Mexicans, Muslims, Women etc). Though Trump is not known for pulling his punches, when it comes to the Jews, Trump chooses his words very carefully. Trump, according to Greenberg, is so careful ¡°that it¡¯s not clear that Trump himself fully understands the implications of what he¡¯s saying.¡± I guess that the Jewish academic couldn¡¯t restrain herself from looking down at the Goy candidate. 
Greenberg sees Trump as a puppet-master who controls his audience by means of ¡®dog whistling.¡¯ ¡°Trump¡¯s references to money, bankers and international conspiracies appear to be deliberate anti-Semitic dog whistles, and his alt-right supporters recognize (and celebrate) that.¡± 
Greenberg elaborates on her observation, ¡°first of all, dog whistles serve when overt expressions are not an option; they communicate to those who are familiar with the conspiracy theories but maintain plausible deniability.¡± According to Greenberg, when Trump wants to communicate a message about the Jews, he uses an indecipherable code intelligible only to half of the Americans . . . Greenberg and the ADL. 
If Greenberg is correct, if Trump says ¡®international Bankers¡¯ but really means Jews, then both the Republican candidate and half of the American people are fearful of the Jews. They must very well understand what a confrontation with Jewish institutions may entail. They know that, in America, criticism of Mexicans, Women, and Muslims is a kosher territory but even a subtle criticism of Jews may cost them dearly. One may wonder, how did this happen? What is the substance of that magical power that empowers half of Americans to speak in codes when they think about Jews? 
Greenberg seems to raise the right question just to come up with the wrong answer. ¡°Why would anti-Semitism not be an overt option, while racism, sexism, and xenophobia are?¡± 
¡°Americans are less willing to accept blatant anti-Semitism than racism,¡± Greenberg¡¯s answers. 
What Greenberg really wants to say is that Americans can be racists and can say whatever they like about whoever they want. But when it comes to Jews, they refrain. Americans do know very well the geography of the boundaries of correctness. Jewish power is for them a taboo, at least momentarily. America and Americans are fully aware of the enormous power that is bestowed in the hands of just a few Jewish oligarchs within the ubiquitous industries of media, finance, politics, and culture. 
America would have loved to dissolve the situation peacefully but it can¡¯t. Jewish power can¡¯t be contained or suppressed because we are not even allowed to allude to it, let alone point it out. 
Jewish power is defined as the power to silence criticism of Jewish power. Jewish power, as such, is a ticking time bomb. It is a unique form of self-destructiveness. The history of the Jews proves this point. Time after time it is Jewish power that sets the path towards a glamorous Jewish golden age that leads to the most severe tragic consequences. 
The Jewish phobia of anti-Semitism is not driven by fear of the gentile. It is actually the other way around. The Jewish fear of anti-Semitism is the result of Jews being fearful of their own might. Jews tend to recognise that there is something in themselves that evokes animosity from others. This is the true meaning of the Jewish ¡°Pre Traumatic Stress Syndrome.¡± It is the acceptance that from here forward, things can only get worse. Many Jews see in Trump¡¯s popularity a symptom of a fatigue of their own power. They interpret the nostalgic yearning for ¡®America being great¡¯ as a pining for a Christian past. Something that predates Goldman Sachs¡¯ and Soros¡¯ dominion. The Jewish aggression towards Trump can be realised as an expression of Jewish guilt. Yet, Trump himself has very little to do with it. He married his daughter to a Jew. He trades with Jews, he loves Israel. He is almost as Jewish as the Clintons. 
Greenberg is optimistic. For her, Trump¡¯s popularity is ¡°the final gasping of white supremacy.¡± His voters¡ªpretty much half of the American people¡ªare dogs reacting to a man with a whistle. I am not as optimistic as Greenberg. I think that exploring such contempt towards half of the American people in the name of a vague progressive mantra is a very dangerous game. It suggests to me that progressives have reached a state of complete detachment.

It occurred to me in recent years that the act of being progressive is not a political position but rather a mental state. 
The incapacity of the entire American progressive and left establishment to foresee Trump¡¯s landslide victory suggests that we are dealing with people who are institutionally detached 
Just three days ahead of the presidential elections, the Huffington Post pathetically criticised star pollster Nate Silver of ¡°Unskewing Polls in Trump¡¯s direction,¡± for suggesting that a Trump victory was realistic. Ryan Grim wrote: ¡°HuffPost Pollster is giving Clinton a 98 percent chance of winning, and The New York Times¡¯ model at The Upshot puts her chances at 85 percent.¡± 
¡°There is one outlier, however, that is causing waves of panic among Democrats around the country and injecting Trump backers with the hope that their guy might pull this thing off after all. Nate Silver¡¯s 538 model gives Donald Trump a heart-stopping 35% chance of winning as of this weekend.¡± 
The Huffington Post went as far as accusing Silver of ¡°making a mockery of the very forecasting industry that he popularized.¡± 
In perspectives, Nate Silver and his 538 were obviously spot on. The Huffington Post and The New York Times were totally off the mark. Is it a coincidence? 
How is it possible that the Democratic Party, the mainstream media and Wall Street have managed to totally miss the level of anger that unites the American masses. These questions go far beyond polling strategy or the science of statistics. We are dealing with a state of being aloof on the verge of total detachment. 
Left and progressive thinking is shaped like a dream. It tells us what the world ought to be. Progressives often seem to forget what the world really is and what its people are really like. Hillary Clinton and her campaign, just like the New York Times and The Huffington Post, were in a state of denial. Boasting in righteous hubris, they failed to read the map. 
But this shouldn¡¯t take us by a complete surprise. Detachment wasn¡¯t invented by Clinton and her team. Detachment and alienation are ingrained in progressive thought. To be a progressive is to believe that some of the ¡®other¡¯ people are simply a bunch of unaware ¡®reactionaries.¡¯ Progressive thought is the secular manifestation of ¡®chosenness.¡¯ It is inherently Jewish, a fact that explains why Hillary Clinton¡¯s top five donors were Jewish billionaires . 
Since being progressive is a form of supremacy. I would go as far as suggesting that progressives¡¯ antagonism towards ¡®white supremacy,¡¯ is at large, a form of projection. The progressive attributes to ¡®whiteness¡¯ his own exceptionalist inclinations. 
Americans vs. Identitarians 
On election day, we learned that the Democratic Party was hanging on a thread, hoping to be saved by Florida¡¯s ¡®Hispanic vote.¡¯ Clinton¡¯s political future depended upon the hope that Trump had managed to upset enough Latinos. This peculiar development in which a national party is dependent on group politics shouldn¡¯t take us by surprise anymore. 
The 2016 American presidential election divided America into two camps: The Americans on one side and the Identitarians on the other. The Americans are those who see themselves primarily as American patriots. They are driven by rootedness and heritage. For them, the promise to make ¡®America great again¡¯ confirms that Utopia is nostalgia and that the progressive reality is nothing short of dystopia. The Identitarians, on the other hand, are those who subscribe to progressive sectarian politics. They see themselves primarily as LGBTQ, Latino, Black, Jews, Women, and so on. Their bond with the American national or patriotic ethos is secondary and often non-existent. The future of the Democratic Party, in its current form, depends upon the hope that American subscriptions to sectarian ideologies will gradually increase and, as a result, will eventually strengthen the context of identity or group politics. The progressive agenda banks on the divestiture of the national and patriotic ethos. Needless to mention that half of America voted for Clinton. Hence, this political agenda is far from being farfetched or delusional. 
But the Identitarian agenda backfired. It was only a question of time before the so-called ¡®whites¡¯ or ¡®rednecks¡¯ grasped that their backs have been pressed to the wall. They also started to act and think as an identitarian political sector. Hillary Clinton calling Trump¡¯s voters a ¡°basket of deplorables¡± was a clear sign for white poor Americans that Hillary wasn¡¯t exactly their ally. However, Hillary was far from being alone. Almost every Jewish writer within the American press didn¡¯t miss the opportunity to attribute the ¡°White Supremacist¡± label to Trump¡¯s voters. For Cheryl Greenberg, Trump¡¯s popularity was ¡°the final gasping of white supremacy.¡± For T alking Points Memo¡¯s Josh Marshall , Trump¡¯s closing ad was packed with ¡°anti-Semitic dog whistles, anti-Semitic tropes, and anti-Semitic vocabulary.¡± For Marshall and Goldberg, half of the American people were dogs obeying their master¡¯s whistle. 
It shouldn¡¯t take us by surprise that half of the American people would eventually react. They became weary of Jewish progressives like Marshall and Goldberg seeing them as dogs and white supremacists. The time was ripe for a revolution. 
So is the revolution here? I¡¯m not holding my breath. The people who crowned Trump are certainly exhausted. They are ready for a change. Can Trump introduce such a change? No one knows. He is certainly going to keep us entertained.

A populist wave that began with Brexit in June became a tsunami as Trump¡¯s cyclone hit Washington Tuesday night, leaving the capital in a shambles. His is a story straight out of Grimm¡¯s fairytales. the peasants rose up. The phony civility of the neoconservative nightmare that Americans (and the world) have endured for years is cracking. 
Trump¡¯s victory is pure protest by the masses. Exciting, but disturbing, as Trump is just another billionaire. He will be sure to look after his own, but then again, maybe he can stare them down. Fortunately, there is the Republican Congress and Senate to provide stability as the upstart get his feet on the ground. The weakened Democrats will have to fight extra hard after years of complacency under the nice, liberal Obama. 
For critics of media control by the Israel lobby in the US, and the sham elections where money rules, the victory shattered this paradigm. ¡°Though the ¡®Masters of Discourse¡¯ control the entirety of world media, and they decide what people may think and say from Canada to Hong Kong, only you, American citizens, can defeat them. Trump has a great quality making him fit for the task: he is impervious to labels and libels. He had been called everything in the book: anti-Semite, racist, women hater, you name it. And he still survived that flak. Such people are very rare,¡± writes Israel Shamir. 
Almost all presidents since Jimmy Carter have campaigned as outsiders. Reagan, Bill Clinton, Bush jr, Obama. But they were all seasoned politicians and all disappointed. 
President Trump¡ªthink: Governor Ventura 
There is a precedent of a boorish outsider, made famous and pilloried in the media, who catapulted into the political world. His name is Jesse Ventura, a former professional wrestler who served as the 38th Governor of Minnesota from 1999 to 2003. He was the first member of the Reform Party to win a major government position, now in the Independence Party of Minnesota. 
He surprised everyone with a sober, uncorrupt term in office, reforming taxation and constructing the METRO Blue Line light rail in Minneapolis¨CSaint Paul. He shattered the Republican-Democratic stranglehold and no one suffered. Trump has shattered it again. He makes a path open to a third party or independent candidate in the future. 
Trump¡¯s trump card 
Trump¡¯s final ad, a 2-minute masterpiece of populist rhetoric infuriated the ADL for hinting the obvious: the forces of international finance that have their own agenda for the US, behind our backs, and whose agent is/was Hillary Clinton. He depicted a ¡°global power structure¡± that is ¡°bleeding America dry¡± with horrible trade deals that enrich elites and open the gates to mass immigration. 
The people behind this globalist takeover include George Soros, Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen and Goldman Sachs Chairman Lloyd Blankfein, with the implication that Clinton is their minion. ¡°The Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure. We¡¯ve seen this first hand in the WikiLeaks documents, in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors,¡± charged Trump. 
That jab alone was worth more than all of Hillary¡¯s millions spent on ads attacking him for peccadilloes. Now the intelligent Republicans are waking up. Trumps¡¯ words are branded in their minds. That alone makes the election historic. 
The ADl¡¯s slander of Trump¡ªthis ad touches on images and rhetoric that anti-Semites have used for age¡ªmerely alerted Americans to the emptiness of the ¡®anti-Semitic¡¯ slur. If something is true, pointing it out is not bigotry. 
Senior House deputy whip Dennis Ross of Florida lauds Trump for his known ability as negotiator. ¡°Sure, he might toss out statements like ¡®build a wall,¡¯ or ¡®no Muslims,¡¯ and say something sensational. But then he knows how to give in a bit and come up with a solution.¡± 
House Speaker Paul Ryan publicly disowned Trump during the campaign, and now has to eating crow. The closest modern comparison of an outsider president and a speaker of the same political party may be the fractious relationship during the late 1970s between Democrats President Jimmy Carter and House Speaker Tip O¡¯Neill. Carter¡¯s team didn¡¯t have an appreciation for how the system worked in Washington and struggled to advance his agenda. 
New American ball game 
The Republican win in the Congress and Senate, with a Republican president, offers a chance to produce meaningful change. Will Trump develop more concern for the environment and work to help the millions of poor Americans who put their trust in him? He has a huge responsibility to repay his voters and give hope for reconciliation with his opponents. There is much soul searching to be done now, on both sides of the divide in American political life. 
The election represents a call to action for people to fight hard to save the environment, rebuild a county falling apart, and demand a responsible US foreign policy. 
Democracy only works when we all take part. People are awakening from their Wall St induced sleep. Look for a new ¡®Occupy Wall St¡¯ and peace campaigning. 
That¡¯s the bright side. Trump¡¯s policies on the Middle East and Iran are confused and incoherent. Let¡¯s hope that his friendship with Vladimir Putin portends realism, and the ability and intent to change the US imperial mindset that plagues the world. The French are just as furious with the same scenario there. Trump¡¯s victory makes a victory for the Front National¡¯ s Marine Le Pen more likely. ¡°The American people¡ªfree!¡± Le Pen tweeted as Trump¡¯s count reached the threshold of victory. 
It also gives energy to Britain¡¯s vote to leave the European Union. Protest candidates throughout Europe have gained votes and seats in many countries, and entered government coalitions in 11 Western democracies, including in Austria, Italy and Switzerland. 
This wave of protest is gathering momentum. The American people have the chance now, and the responsibility, to help shape where Trump will take his ¡®revolution.¡¯ Whether he can work with his foreign counterparts to create a people¡¯s ¡®new world order¡¯, not the one Bush Sr. promised in 1991 and that Bush Jr. failed to achieve. Foreign policy has too long been off limits, done by elites behind closed doors. 
Government has to listen to the people now, after years of passivity and policies shaped by the elite. Trump made serious promises to revitalize American. People will now hold him to them.

One likely winner to come out of the 2016 US presidential election: accuracy in polling. Obviously not past but future polling! 
Donald Trump, from the start of his campaign to capture the presidency, harangued his followers during the rallies with such unrestricted language that they felt liberated, able to speak out their minds without any fear of repression or recrimination. Well, at least not in the safety and camaraderie of their rallies; although also aware that politically correct America frowned on such openness, leaving them with a bi-forked tongue when applied to people who would likely judge, or categorize them . . . and that definitely applied to pollsters. 
One suspects that as much as 10 percent of the actual Trump vote came out of what we could call correctness-hiding, making total mockery of most pollsters. As a pertinent note I might add that while a student in operations research, I had a professor (Anant Negandhi, UCLA) who then claimed that polling involving issues with sociopolitical subjectivity was for the most part worthless because of the difficulty in modeling a survey which would correctively identify and quantify both the causal and intervening variables. Over a generation later, that difficulty has not really changed; nor has the need of pollsters to make a living, which may push them to sell smoke and mirrors to a well-funded political establishment. 
My own observation in weighing the impact of Trump¡¯s campaign on his followers, most particularly those in the construction trades, has been one where from the start of the campaign, and solidly after Trump¡¯s winning the Republican candidacy, these people who had expressed racial and ethnic bias with some trepidation were now doing so with little angst, as if their speech now had society¡¯s imprimatur and they had been godfathered by Donald Trump. 
After the cataclysmic misreading by a polling industry that has reverted from a science to an art . . . lagging miles behind the weather predicting science, one would expect the rigidity of science to take a critical role. So, of necessity if wishing to survive, the entire industry must undergo a true and complete overhaul. And that would be one positive result from this election: accuracy in polling. 
Now that Trump has become president-elect, to be escorted to the White House by a Republican Congress . . . and a conservative-in-waiting Supreme Court, will the specter of political correctness exit from American life? Not likely; but rest assured that there will be a great degree of accommodation for the 26 percent of American bigoted patriots (bigopats). [Read my article of June 16, 2016: Bigopats: ¡® Undocumented¡¯ Largest Group in American Politics . ] 
To say that America is divided is a mini-characterization of incredible proportions that we, as a nation, will have incredible difficulty in overcoming . . . and perhaps never will. First, we must cope with the surreal realization that this United States of America isn¡¯t at all represented by Kansas being a dream away from Oz. The results from this last election have told us the naked truth about our nation; a truth that most Americans would like to keep under wraps: that more than a divided country split in two or more political camps, America is really a fallen Humpty Dumpty fragmented economically, socially, and politically in a way that it will take a Herculean effort to be able to put it back together again. An effort that requires drastic change: both political and institutional. 
Once upon a united America, we insist in telling ourselves, we were the land of promise and hope; the great experiment in humankind: economic opportunity, the American dream, the mythical melting pot, freedom, dignity and self-realization. But we seem to forget, that it was the economic wellbeing in the America of generations past that did provide the glue that kept our multi-part Humpty Dumpty (diverse America) sitting smilingly on the wall, looking condescendingly over the rest of the world. 
Globalization has melted that glue; and economic change for that symbolic American middle class, whether coming from the Right (Trump) or the Left (Sanders), is unlikely to improve their lot. But at the end of the day, neither would have that middle path that Hillary Clinton would have walked.

The good news is that Hillary lost but the bad news is that Trump won. 
A massive take-down of the gold and silver markets was put into action shortly after it became obvious that Trump was going to take the election, shortly after midnight EST. Gold had finished soaring about $64 when early returns indicated the possibility of an upset. So why was gold methodically disemboweled once Trump emerged as the official winner? 
Contrary to all the propaganda smoke being blown from the right and the left, Trump won because of economics. Going back to 1932, in any Presidential election year in which the growth in real disposable income was less than 3.1%, the incumbent party holding the White House lost the White House ¨C in 2016 the official real disposable income growth has been 2.33%. Please re-read that fact and let it sink in. There¡¯s been six elections in which this occurred ¨C this table was sourced from John Wiliams¡¯ Shadowstats.com: 
In other words, people vote with their wallets. The reason gold has been inexorably smashed in the paper markets ¨C along with the Dow and S&P 500 manipulated higher ¨C is nothing more than a form of propaganda in an attempt to make the public believe that a Trump presidency is a good thing ¨C that Trump can save the economy from collapse. Jim Sinclair refers to this as ¡°MOPE:¡± Management of Perception Economics. It¡¯s the Central Planners¡¯ signal that they still intend to continue stealing your wealth. They don¡¯t care who is sitting in the Oval Office. 
The takedown in gold included cooperation from India¡¯s Prime Minister ¨C a western elitist lapdog ¨C who ¡°coincidentally¡± removed large denomination currency bills from the banking system last week in an attempt to curtail the Indian public¡¯s current voracious appetite for physical gold. Removing this element from the global market last week enabled the Fed and bullion banks to bombard the Comex and LBMA with massive amounts of paper gold derivatives to push down the price of gold. 
Of course, the shenanigans in the west have stimulated demand for gold even more in the Asian markets. Last night the market premium in Viet Nam soared to over $91. Premiums this high in Viet Nam have not been seen since at least 2011. On the Shanghai Gold Exchange the market premium soared to $12.47 above world gold ¨C on Friday it was $8.20. It is rare when the premium gets this high on the SGE and signals very heavy demand. 
In today¡¯s episode of the Shadow of Truth, we put closure ¨C at least for us ¨C on last week¡¯s election and we explain why Trump has no intentions of ¡°draining the Swamp¡± and why the current take-down in the price of gold and silver is setting the market up for a much bigger move higher: Share this:",english,2016-11-15T04:44:22.640+02:00,investmentresearchdynamics.com,US,,Gold Signals Trump Is No Different,0,http://investmentresearchdynamics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-2.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Posted from St. Martin (the French side, of course!). I kind of expected this to happen, as close friends and colleagues can attest. Trump is not only NOT going ¡°drain the swamp,¡± he¡¯s populating it with a different breed of swamp monster. His choice for AG is a red-neck, right-wing senator from Alabama who, 80 years ago, would have been a member of the inner circle of the Third Reich. Ditto for the names that have been floated for Secretary of State. As for Treasury Secretary, the names floated for the position bear the unmistakable mark of the Wall Street beast: $6$6$6. They are every bit as vile, if not worse, than the thieves that moved through there the last 12 years. Jamie Dimon? Steve Mnuchin? Give me an F-ing break. 
It is what it is. Out with the old, in with new old. James Kunstler penned another epic post that deserves a thorough perusal: For all practical purposes, both traditional parties have blown themselves up. The Democratic Party morphed from the party of thinking people to the party of the thought police, and for that alone they deserve to be flushed down the soil pipe of history where the feckless Whigs went before them. The Republicans have floundered in their own Special Olympics of the Mind for decades, too, so it¡¯s understandable that they have fallen hostage to such a rank outsider as Trump, so cavalier with the party¡¯s dumb-ass shibboleths. It remains to be seen whether the party becomes a vengeful, hybrid monster with an orange head, or a bridge back to reality. I give the latter outcome a low percentage chance. 
The stock market continued a stunning move higher last week despite evidence of widespread financial market turmoil signaled by the bond and currency markets globally.

by Carol Adl 
Donald Trump has warned that Hillary Clinton¡¯s policy towards Syria would lead to World War III , arguing that the Democratic nominee would drag the US into a confrontation with nuclear armed Russia. 
Trump said ¡°You¡¯re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton¡± adding that ¡°What we should do is focus on ISIS We should not be focusing on Syria¡± 
The US Republican presidential nominee made the remarks on Tuesday during a Reuters interview in response to Clinton¡¯s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ¡°safe zones¡± in Syria. 
Press TV reports: 
On October 7, the Democratic nominee said a no-fly zone was required inside the war-ravaged country to stabilize fighting, a move that was opposed in Congress due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia, since a US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down Russian fighter jets should they enter Syrian airspace. 

Clinton also described the situation in Syria as ¡°incredibly complex¡± since the intervention of Russia. 
¡°You¡¯re not fighting Syria anymore; you¡¯re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,¡± Trump said. 
The Republican nominee also referred to the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power as a second-level priority to defeating Daesh. 
¡°Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIL,¡± Trump said. 
Russia might down US planes 
Meanwhile, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also warned about the consequences of Clinton¡¯s push for a no-fly zone in Syria that could spark a conflict with Russia. 
Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, Clapper said Clinton¡¯s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria could lead to Russia shooting down American planes there. 
¡°I wouldn¡¯t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they ¡ª if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,¡± he said. 
¡°I take stock in the nature of the weaponry that they deploy and why they ¡ª why they did that,¡± Clapper said of Russian weapons recently deployed to Syria. ¡°The system they have there is a very advanced air-defense system. It¡¯s very capable. And I don¡¯t think they¡¯d do it and deploy it unless they had some intent to use it.¡± 
During the third and final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her remarks on a no-fly zone that could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict in Syria. 
A foreign-backed militancy has been going on in Syria since March 2011, with a plethora of armed groups ¡ª each supported by one foreign country or another ¡ª fighting the Assad government. 
Since 2014, the United States, along with a number of its allies, has been leading a so-called anti-terror campaign in Syria and neighboring Iraq.

Before we get into the meat of this thing, let me make two things very clear: The evidence presented here is not the usual half-checked/chosen at random/doctored stuff we¡¯re used to in madcap conspiracy rumours. Everything shown here is a matter of undisputed public record ¨C a rare thing in this Presidential campaign I¡¯m not trying to prove a theory here, as I lack the resources to do so. I am merely using informed logic to establish those four things required to build any credible case: behavioural track record, means, motive and opportunity. There is no doubt in my mind, however, that in terms of capability of performing dirty tricks, the Clinton campaign ticks all four boxes. The Clintons¡¯ track record on dirty tricks 
Negative advertising, smear rumour, making rally halls look more full/empty on TV and innate media bias have all been obvious for many years in Western election campaigns. Not surprisingly, during Presidential campaigns this is heightened by the physically more personal nature of the contest. 
Huffington Post banned The Slog from commenting in 2012 after I alleged the use of troll swarms by Obama to mess up Republican sites. Three months later, his White House CoS casually confirmed the story. 
This is truth bending, and isn¡¯t illegal. But the Clinton track record against Bernie Sanders is of a quite different order. I was given first-hand evidence, for example, of blatant threats to Democratic National Convention (DNC) workers that anyone helping organise Sanders rallies would have no future or place in a Clinton White House. But there is also disturbing evidence of electoral irregularity as well. October 2015 ¨C over 120,000 voting registrations lost in Brooklyn ¨C & rock solid Sanders neighbourhood, plus nearly a third of Sanders supporters complaining that, on pitching up to vote, their Party registrations had been changed Over nine straight 2015 primaries, Sanders won seven: in the other two, ¡°massive voter irregularities¡± were reported. Hillary won them. The supposedly neutral DNC is stuffed with overt Clinton activists. The private company collecting sensitive poll/registration information NPG van has close ties to Bill Clinton and worked for him in 1992. Leaks from NPG are, to say the least, recurrent. On the eve of the Democratic party¡¯s convention in Philadelphia, a whopping 20,000 emails were made public by Wikileaks showing supposedly ¡®neutral¡¯ senior party officials tried to undermine Mr Sanders¡¯s insurgent left-wing campaign by publicly portraying him as an atheist. Solidly Sanders locations in Arizona¡¯s Maciopa County found their polling booths available reduced from 200 to 60. Odd behaviour during a Primary campaign. Undercover videos just four days ago showed two senior DNC operatives openly admitting to paid interference with Trump rallies and voter registration manipulation. 
These days, one talks to Washington pundits who ¨C sadly ¨C shrug and say ¡°both sides are at it ¨C they cancel each other out¡±. But what I¡¯ve shown above is just a fraction of highlights compared to the total media exposure of Clinton criminality. Doing a quick count from 78 sites, press titles and broadcasters last night, allegations against the Clinton campaign outnumber all others by 5/2. 
However, it¡¯s at this point that we go beyond even electoral irregularity and into suggestions of Hillary Clinton perverting the course of events at the Department of Justice (DoJ). Here, we segue neatly into ¡®means¡¯. The means to destroy Trump 
Without any shadow of doubt, the biggest bubbling-under scandal of the campaign (until complaints about Trump¡¯s locker-room and sex abuse behaviour ¡®surfaced¡¯) was that involving emails sent by Hillary Clinton during her time as Secretary of State. 
The headline here is this: while heading up State, she only used her own personal and heavily abuse-protected server to send official emails ¨C rather than official State Department email accounts maintained on federal servers. On leaving that job, the State Department hurriedly classified all the emails retrospectively. 
This suggestive of the fact that Ms Clinton has something to hide. Her behaviour was also highly irregular, and cannot solely be explained by national security concerns: if there are fears about how secure State is, then we may as well all pack up and go home. (There are as it happens; but their security is a hundred times more sophisticated than hers). 
Hillary maintains that her behaviour did not break federal rules, and there are precedents to show that. The hole in her defence is that there are no precedents for all the emails to have produced on her private server. 
Having seen the content of some 150 emails, the FBI began by being quite bullish on the subject of an investigation. But then suddenly it wasn¡¯t. An anodyne report was eventually issued in July 2016, criticising her ¡°extreme carelessness¡±. 
Her behaviour does not support that finding. Over at the DoJ, Dan Metcalfe, head of the Justice Department¡¯s Office of Information and Privacy (FOIA), said this gave her even tighter control over her emails by not involving a third party such as Google, and helped prevent their disclosure by Congressional subpoena. He added: ¡°She managed successfully to insulate her official emails, categorically, from the FOIA, both during her tenure at State and long after her departure from it¡ªperhaps forever¡±, making it ¡°a blatant circumvention of the FOIA by someone who unquestionably knows better¡± . 
But neither State nor the DoJ did anything. The former issued a report making it clear that Secretary Clinton had lied to employees about the ¡®permission¡¯ she had, and confirmed that permission had never been sought. She also lied to the media about never sending classified material via her own server: a review of the 55,000-page email eventually released found ¡°hundreds of potentially classified emails¡±. 
There is a clear ¨C very clear ¨C scenario that scopes out here: that of an ambitious wannabe US President conspiring to hide her guilt about stuff in perpetuity. Among the forty emails held back by US security agencies are those assumed to refer to the Benghazi Compound disaster, during which the Ambassador lost his life in the most bestial manner. 
However, the FBI having been quietly told to pipe down, the job facing the Clintons now was to get the DoJ onside. Bill went right to the very top. 
In late June 2016, it was reported that Bill Clinton met privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on her private plane on the tarmac at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Three days later, a Justice Department official categorically told the media that Attorney General Lynch will accept ¡°whatever recommendation career prosecutors and the F.B.I. director make about whether to bring charges related to Hillary Clinton¡¯s personal email server¡±. 
Washington sources confirm that Lynch ¡°already pretty much knew what the FBI would say¡±. Did the Clintons have a strong motive? 
Nothing is ever conclusive in these areas. But the overwhelming suggestion from these events is that the Clintons most certainly do have the means to influence the activities and output of the Justice Department. 
However, it¡¯s easy to argue that Candidate Clinton had little to fear from Trump; the media almost universally dismissed him as a no-hoper. So why take the risk of, potentially, using the DoJ to put her adversary in a spot? 
It¡¯s easy to argue that, but the US media have been wrong about Donald Trump since Day One. And the facts don¡¯t support the argument. 
Last night, the BBC released this trend map of the poll support for each candidate throughout the campaign: 
On this diagram, I have indicated in green ink the two points at which Clinton and Trump are neck and neck. In early to mid July ¨C following embarrassing email revelations ¨C Clinton¡¯s support dips, and Trump briefly overtakes her. 
From the word go, the Clinton campaign saw Trump¡¯s financial background, practices and exposure as an obvious weakness. Having pressed hard for his tax returns, once his official election as the GOP presidential nominee was confirmed ¨C June 19th 2016 ¨C they began demanding to see his financials. 
In fact, they already knew of one unfortunate link: on March 20th, the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal had featured a piece showing Donald Trump¡¯s massive dependence on Deutsche Bank as a credit supplier. The Murdoch press is campaigning solidly for Hillary, and Rupert himself has given substantial donations to her presidential bid. His motives towards her and Deutsche have been detailed by The Slog elsewhere . 
The dates here are key ¨C particularly the dates from which Deutsche Bank ceases to be ¡®troubled¡¯ in the background, and increasingly becomes a foreground, front-page crisis . 
In early to mid June, Trump racks up his support and closes the gap with Clinton.Other financial papers pick up on the WSJ story¡­.despite the fact that Trump¡¯s cash flow and personal salary alone would be enough to pay off all the Deutsche loans. At this point, the International Monetary Fund releases a report saying that Deutsche Bank ¡°appears to be the most important net contributor to systemic risks in the global banking system.¡± 
The IMF ¨C and its boss Christine Lagarde ¨C are prime movers in aiding Clintonian foreign policy relating to the EU and North Africa. But still Trump¡¯s support leaps from 34-40%. Then early July, S&P Global Ratings lowers its outlook on Deutsche Bank to negative. At the same time, Deutsche Bank¡¯s U.S. unit fails the U.S. Federal Reserve¡¯s stress test. The story filters down into non-specialist media. Clinton consolidates her lead. 
But by this time, DB is starting to look like a basket case ¨C which it has been for years ¨C and the ¡®ailing¡¯ bank gets kicked out of the STOXX blue-chip Europe 50 index. 
And yet, the Donald starts to recover momentum. By mid September, he¡¯s back to almost neck and neck. It¡¯s now that the DoJ Establishment goes for the throat.The Justice Department chooses this precise moment ¨C September 16th ¨C to splash with the news that Deutsche Bank faces a whopping $14.5 billion malpractice fine. Within hours, its shares go into freefall. 
Between September 20th and 28th, a broader media blitz and online campaign openly calls Trump ¡°massively dependent on Deutsche loans¡±. Counterspin from the Deutsche camp claims negotiations to reduce the DoJ fine are well in hand. Two days later Justice splashes again: no, it alleges, they haven¡¯t even started yet. 
But still, general awareness of the Trump-Deutsche link remains low¡­.and Trump himself steadies his poll ratings. Locker rooms, pussy grabbing abuse allegations suddenly sprout via close Clinton ally David Farenthold. Donald¡¯s poll ratings dive. 
Donald Trump is just beginning to recover his position. Already pro-Democrat sites are switching tack to say that Trump ¡°is a puppet candidate of foreign banks¡± ¨C a silly allegation, given that he only works with one, and it¡¯s more dependent on his business than vice versa. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice has Deutsche CEO John Cryan by the balls; as far as the Clintons are concerned, it holds all the cards. Opportunity 
For myself, I doubt very much that Hillary & Co will go any further down the ¡®dodgy credit¡¯ road. With only two weeks to go to Election day, an imminent Deutsche collapse would play into Trump¡¯s allegedly wandering hands: it is, after all, the US unit that faces the fine, and Trump¡¯s populism is anti Wall Street. 
I think an equal (if not bigger) force behind pushing Deutsche Bank into the limelight is that of forcing it into a Middle East role where it can be a Rottweiller controlled by State, its old boss Hillary Clinton, and massive regional investor Rupert Murdoch. 
But while the opportunity was there, it¡¯s obvious that Bill Clinton had all the influence his wife needs to help her get elected. Indeed, by being so unpopular in his own Party, Donald Trump has made this a much easier task: nobody but nobody in the US ¨¦lite wants Trump in the White House. 
As I endeavoured to stress at the outset, the object in this post is not to prove a conspiracy, but rather to present an avalanche of evidence to support one simple ¨C and widespread ¨C observation about the Hillarybillies: as their power has increased, so too has their megalomania inflated to a frightening degree. 
Where once there were only crooked land deals and cigars to go on, today it is easy to argue that this creepy couple are operating at the kind of level where the American systems of Law, foreign policy, power separation and democracy itself are being perverted. This much has been obvious for some time; but American voters need to make their minds up by November 8th which they want least ¨C Donald Trump in the White House, or Mr and Mrs Clinton doing the bidding of corporate globalism¡­while dragging the US further and further towards geopolitical confrontation. 
Looked at in that way, while this has probably been the most superficial and childish Presidential contest in American history, it will probably also turn out to have been the most important.",english,2016-10-27T11:50:37.014+03:00,investmentwatchblog.com,US,68648,DONALD TRUMP & DEUTSCHE BANK: DID CLINTONS LEAN ON US JUSTICE DEPARTMENT?,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

by Geoffrey Grider DONALD TRUMP HAS A SLIM ADVANTAGE IN FLORIDA AS CRITICAL INDEPENDENT VOTERS NARROWLY BREAK HIS WAY IN THE MUST-WIN BATTLEGROUND STATE, A BLOOMBERG POLITICS POLL SHOWS. I can¡¯t speak for south Florida , but as a longtime resident of north Florida I can promise you that there is a near frenzy of support for Donald Trump here. Over the past year I have seen endless amounts of Trump signs, stickers and banners. I saw a fair amount of pro-Bernie stuff as well. But pro-Hillary advertising? It¡¯s practically non-existent, I haven¡¯t even seen half a dozen stickers and absolutely zero lawn signs. So I find it astonishing when I turn on the ¡°news¡± and hear the libs talking about Hillary¡¯s double-digit lead over Trump. It¡¯s not true, don¡¯t believe it. Donald Trump is doing great and is on track to win the White House in just under two weeks. The Republican presidential nominee has 45 percent to Democrat Hillary Clinton¡¯s 43 percent among likely voters when third-party candidates are included, the poll found . In a hypothetical two-way race, Trump has 46 percent to Clinton¡¯s 45 percent. DONALD TRUMP RALLY IN SAINT AUGUSTINE DRAWS TENS OF THOUSANDS: 
With over 4,000 people already inside the Saint Augustine Amphitheater, I took 60 seconds to do a walk-thru of just a fraction of the thousands of people in the overflow section who stood there for hours waiting to see Donald Trump. This is the type of support Trump has here in Florida. Among independents , Trump gets 43 percent to Clinton¡¯s 41 percent in a head-to-head contest. When third-party candidates are included, Trump picks up 1 point with independents while Clinton drops to 37 percent, with Libertarian Gary Johnson taking 9 percent and the Green Party¡¯s Jill Stein getting 5 percent. ¡°This race may come down to the independent vote,¡± said pollster J. Ann Selzer, who oversaw the survey. ¡° Right now, they tilt for Trump . By a narrow margin, they opted for Obama over Romney in 2012.¡± Trump¡¯s showing in this poll is stronger than in other recent surveys in the state.

Are the elite foreshadowing the future of America?! 
It seems so. 
All throughout the month of October, mainstream media has made cryptic statements, scenarios, and outcomes regarding what America could look like if Donald Trump loses the presidential race. 
In an article from The Boston Globe, one scenario includes a potential American uprising. During the presidential debates and campaigns, Mr. Trump has alleged the election as being ¡°rigged,¡± in favor of Hillary Clinton. According to a Bloomberg News poll, 56% of Trump backers believe the election will be ¡®¡®rigged¡±¡­ even though the ¡°election¡± is really a SELECTION. 
However, The Washington Times has also questioned the same thing: Will there be some type of uprising, civil unrest, or some other triggered outcome if Donald Trump were to ¡°lose¡± the elections? 
It¡¯s also very cryptic to note how former Republican Joe Walsh made this interesting Twitter statement as of October 26th, 2016: ¡°If Trump loses, I¡¯m grabbing my musket.¡± 
Then there¡¯s the ¡°Russian threat,¡± which is constantly making its way into mainstream news. According to Western sources, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who is an ally of Vladimir Putin, has warned Americans to ¡°vote trump or face nuclear war¡± ¡ª claiming that the Republican candidate is the only person who can prevent an escalation in tensions between Moscow and Washington. He has also said that: ¡°The only way they can get worse is if a war starts.¡± 
And while the American government continues to constantly blame Russia for alleged cyberthreats, cyberattacks, and election hacks ¡ª we know this is all propaganda in preparation for world war.

At 41-28 Trump should be leading the over all poll. Over sampling is happening somewhere. 

Here¡¯s the thing: Bernie voters and black Americans were already Democrats. (Even if she gets 100% of them (which she won¡¯t) she¡¯s not broadening her numbers beyond her own party . . . which is a mere 29% of the electorate.) 
Let¡¯s recap: 29% of the country are Democrats, 29% are Republicans and 42% are Independents. See here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAopWX9Mzgs 
Whoever wins Independents wins the election. 
Trump is more than doubling Hillary¡¯s position with Independents. He¡¯s leading in the single largest voting bloc in the country . . . yet all the mainstream media propaganda polls are pretending like Hillary¡¯s ahead. 
(Of course she isn¡¯t. She¡¯s been losing this entire cycle¨Cwith the media grossly oversampling Democrats and undersampling Independents to create a synthetic paper advantage for her.) 
But things get worse for Hillary than the ass-kicking she¡¯s getting [as a Status Quo candidate] in a Change election, vis-a-vis Independents: For a Democrat to win a national election, they have to carry 92% of the black vote. Trump is now polling between 25-30% of the black vote. (Meaning that Hillary isn¡¯t even coming remotely close to the benchmark she¡¯d need to win.) 
So you have Hillary hemorrhaging African-Americans, Independents and blue collar workers. 
Yet every mainstream media poll is lying to you and telling you she¡¯s winning. 
The math doesn¡¯t work.

When Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign over a year ago, the media barely batted an eye. They all believed he was only trying to boost his business. 
As time went on, he began to win debate after debate and state after state as he received the most votes in Republican primary history while battling sixteen other candidates. The liberal media and Clinton campaign quickly went from thinking he was a joke to fearing him. 
As Trump began to take this country by storm, the media and Clintons tried everything in their power to destroy him. They tried desperately to accuse Donald Trump of inciting violence at his rallies. 
Thanks to videos released by Project Veritas , we now have concrete proof that it was Hillary Clinton that paid operatives to storm Trump rallies and incite violence. 
Hillary Clinton did not just pay mercenaries to assault Trump supporters, she also violated the law on several occasions. 
Robert Creamer, a Clinton crony, was one of the organizers of the paid violence and has also visited Obama at the White House at least 230 times. He was forced to resign from his position immediately following the release of these videos. 
Not only is he a top Hillary ally, but he kept her informed. She knew about these attacks and she ordered them to take place so that Donald Trump looked like he was inciting violence and fueling hate. 
Trump was forced to cancel his rally in Chicago due to the extreme violence by operatives working for Hillary Clinton. 
We are being told that Donald Trump is going to press charges on these people, including Hillary Clinton, under the Felony Mob Act. 
In Illinois, Trump will be citing the Illinois criminal statute. The Mob action is a Class Four felony punishable by 3-6 years in prison and a $25,000 fine for each charge in Illinois. When Trump brings forward the paperwork, he very well could charge anyone associated with helping, planning, organizing, or paying anyone to commit acts of violence¨Cwhich would include Hillary Clinton. 
In Illinois, statute reads as follows: 
A person commits mob action when he or she engages in any of the following: The knowing or reckless use of force or violence disturbing the public peace by 2 or more persons acting together and without authority of law; The knowing assembly of 2 or more persons with the intent to commit or facilitate the commission of a felony or misdemeanor; or The knowing assembly of 2 or more persons, without authority of law, for the purpose of doing violence to the person or property of anyone supposed to have been guilty of a violation of the law, or for the purpose of exercising correctional powers or regulative

It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. 
Reports are circulating that the Clintons have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank, via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. 
This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself, Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn¡¯t plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. 
The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. 
Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office, he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server.

Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration. John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million dollar Nantucket mansion in June 2016, as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. 
President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million dollar seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. 
Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama¡¯s purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams. However, over the last several months, these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. 
Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has.

A number of Americans have promised to leave the United States if GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump wins the November election. 
While President Barack Obama has himself never issued such a pledge, the way his White House press secretary responded Monday to a question about his post-election plans suggested that perhaps he intended to leave as well. 
White House press secretary Josh Earnest took a direct question from a reporter about whether or not Obama himself would leave the county if Trump wins in November ¡ª but he gave anything but a direct answer. 
¡°He¡¯s working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn¡¯t support,¡± press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday during a news briefing on Air Force One, as reported by Politico . 
By no means was that statement an admission of anything; it was, however, a clear dodge. The question was whether or not Obama intended to leave were Trump elected president. Instead of offering a direct answer, Earnest seemingly justified the fears felt by anyone who did plan to leave. 
Is the president himself among those paranoid Americans riddled with fear over the GOP candidate¡¯s potential presidency? This line of thinking might sound conspiratorial, but what the president himself said later that evening on ¡°Jimmy Kimmel Live!¡± only bolstered this perception.

This is understandable, since the people of this war-torn regio n are kin to know what the White House is going to do in the next four years and in which way this will affect the Middle East . As for Barack Obama that is going to leave office pretty soon, it¡¯s hardly a secret that local media sources w ere criticizing his polic ies in strong language. ¡° Obama¡¯s legacy in the Middle East ¡ª is a complete disaster, as the conflict in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya continue, while being unaddressed. ¡± Al Jazeera would often write, quoting a speech delivered by the famous professor of international affairs at Harvard, Stephen Walt. T errorist attacks are shaking Turkey, Tunisia, Lebanon, while the situation in Palestine remains unclear , since the prospect s of a n actual settlement between Israelis and Palestinians are becoming increasingly remote. The steps that the US has taken in Libya and Yemen have led to their complete collapse as states . At the same time, all Obama ever did was to repeat his mantra that ¡°Assad should leave¡±, which only aggravated the war in Syria. The only achievement that Obama can somehow put on his scoreboard ¡ª is the the Iran nuclear deal . According to the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, ¡° this campaign has been so scandalous , it is unlikely that the US will be able to recover from it in the near future .¡± ¡° If America was perceived as a beacon of democracy, its lights have considerably dimmed recently. ¡± ¨C says the Lebanese Daily Star. The remarks of Haed Al Maena, a Saudi journalist writing for the Saudi Gazette were particularly bold. ¡° Th is election campaign was the most polarized one in the U S history, ¡±¨C he would note . Analyzing the course of the election campaign, the author concludes that ¡° the Arabs have to rely on themselves, instead of expecting anything from America .¡± The journalist subjected Hillary Clinton to particularly harsh criticism by claiming that ¡° she¡¯s been kissing ground the Israelis walk on , going as far as promis ing to invite Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu as the first foreign visitor to the White House in case of her victory . She announced strong support for the Israeli government, which occupies other peoples¡¯ land, murdering children and carrying on the worst form of apartheid known to men¡­ This woman does not feel any remorse ¡ª we can just remember her insulting remarks about her husband¡¯s rape victims . The recent revelations released by the WikiLeaks show that she believes that the destruction of Syria will be beneficial to Israel .¡± The Middle Eastern ruling and media elites alike resided on the assumption t hat Hillary Clinton would win. That is why Trump¡¯s success was rather unexpected, which in turn created a massive confusion. Now all the attention is paid to the detailed study and analysis of all the statements the next president of the United States has ever made . One may remember T ru mp ¡®s remarks about him being o n the same side with Russia and the Syrian regime in the fight against ISIS, instead of creating a no-fly zone that Hillary Clinton was advocating. Many Arab journalist are stressing the part of Trump¡¯s speech at the National Convention of the Republican Party in July 2016, where he accused the Obama administration of forcing America to bow to China, Mexico, Russia and the Islamic state. However, an increasing amount of attention is being paid to Trump¡¯s attitude towards Islam and the Muslim refugees. The Al Jazeera has already pu blished an article under the title President of Islamophobia, which stated that Trump rose to the heights of power due to his Islamophobic campaign, and now Islamophobia has b ecome the US official policy. It was noted that at first, when in one of the speeches Trump proposed a ban against Muslims entering the United States, this position received no approval. However, in March 2016, according to the survey, a significant portion of the US population fully supported this approach . One must note that Trump¡¯s position on the Arab-Israeli conflict is also rather sensitive for the Arab world . Trump, notes the above mentioned journalist Khalid Al Maena, would bring no good for the Arab s, since he¡¯s naive and un experienced and will only do what he believes is good for himself. And really ¨C Al Maena concludes ¡ª ¡° how can one treat Arabs with sympathy, if they are at each other¡¯s throats.¡± A number of Arab commentators have already noted that Trump ¡®s positiv e remarks about Israel, as some of them claim that he promise d to move the US embassy to Jerusalem ¡ª the declared but not recognized c apital of the Israeli state.

If they have economic troubles their governments take ever greater control of the public finances, whether through austerity or centrally-dictated spending programmes. When there is civil strife the government calls out the army and restricts liberties to regain control of the situation. When wars are taking place elections are cancelled so the government of the day remains in power to deal with the conflict. These measures have the effect of entrenching the ¡°Establishment¡±, whoever that may be at a given time, and excluding others. People can only play a part in addressing the problems of the country at the whim of the Establishment, with appointments replacing elections in many such scenarios. Only when the Establishment is secure does it allow greater freedom of debate, action and participation, which are regarded as the hallmarks of stable countries . Now Donald Trump has been elected President of the United States on an avowedly anti-Establishment platform. He tapped into those disaffected by the political system and found the issues on which he could make the most noise. That in itself was a virtue with the constituency he was trying to attract. Too many people have become disaffected with politics everywhere because someone has decreed certain views to be unacceptable, without giving a reason why, and Trump was only too happy to give voice to those who have been told that their views don¡¯t entitle them to one. But is Trump¡¯s election the democratic revolution he claims? Does it actually give a voice to the voiceless and power to the powerless? In order to exercise any power President Trump will have to do all the things he accuses his opponents in the Establishment of, but worse. For a while he might get away with it, but he will never have the resources to win in the longer term. All we will have is the methods, with no returns: Establishment oppression on a scale beyond the worst nightmares of the enforced nobodies who now think they are somebody, but are in fact Donald Trump. Who do you think you are? As it turned out, Hillary Clinton failed to get past a problem she would not have had as a Republican. If you are on the conservative end of the political spectrum you are expected to act like you belong in power when you have it. People in more progressive parties claim to represent the interests of the broad mass of people who will never be rich and powerful. If they stay in power for too long, they create a distance between themselves and that mass which erodes their natural support. Hillary Clinton has been a national figure in the US for a generation. Her accession to the Democratic nomination was seen as almost dynastic, a factor which harmed Senator Edward Kennedy when he ran for the Democratic nomination against Jimmy Carter in 1980. She was referred to as the ¡°Establishment candidate¡± throughout the campaign, particularly by members of her own party who preferred socialist Bernie Sanders, who complained throughout the primary process that the voting was being rigged and that the media were falsely reporting that she had won the nomination before it was mathematically certain . For a Republican, all this would play well, except in extreme circumstances such as Watergate. For a Democrat it was bound to depress enthusiasm in the party¡¯s voter base, and either drive it to another candidate or persuade it to stay at home, particularly when enough scandal attaches to Clinton as it is due to her business and government dealings. Clinton was about her nice office in Washington, not the problems of real Democrats. Keeping her there would have solved nothing. This was seen most clearly in Wisconsin, a traditional Democratic mainstay which voted for Trump despite the fact exit pollsters were showing that a large numbers of voters greatly disliked both he and Clinton . Many of those who disliked Trump still voted for him because they felt disliked themselves by politicians such as Clinton, who had let them down more than a newcomer had been able to do. He was ¡°the-none-of-the-above¡± candidate from early on in the primary election period. Poacher turns gamekeeper Whether Trump would have got anywhere near the Republican nomination had there been a Republican president for the last eight years is unlikely. Only as an outsider could he gain any traction within a party which thinks of itself as the natural party of government, and would pick an insider every time to maintain its hold on power. The Republican Party will remain largely embarrassed by Trump, despite his victory. He may be the voters¡¯ idea of a president, but he isn¡¯t what Republican politicians see as a Republican president. As the Huffington Post published underneath every article about Trump from January until election day, ¡°Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ¨C 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ¨C from entering the US.¡± Ask most Republican Congressmen, who control both houses, whether this describes a Republican President and you know what the answer will be, though Trump himself revels in such depictions. Well before the end of his term Trump will have become the Establishment himself. So to achieve anything in the checks and balances system the US has he will either have to carry the party and the military-industrial establishment with him, and become more embedded than Clinton is to do it, or try and purge the very many who will oppose him. Throughout his ¡°business career¡±, if repeated bankruptcy, con, robbing of contractors and tax avoidance can be dignified with such a term, Trump has relied on bluster and a stubborn refusal to face reality to prosper. Whether he can get away with that with the military and intelligence staff who have ruined America¡¯s global reputation with impunity is another matter. Presidents who spent lifetimes working the system have not been able to control the CIA or the industrial and media barons. If Trump tries, he will have to exert extreme control to do it, and become more exclusive than the Establishment itself. Jimmy Carter was elected in 1976 as an antidote to a corrupt political establishment. Despite his long years of public service, he was discarded four years later for being exactly what he was elected to be ¨C a good man out of his depth in murky Washington. Trump has never held any elected office. Is he going to take on those same forces and turn them into public servants? More than he can chew out 
One of Trump¡¯s selling points with poorer Americans is that he pledged to stop US involvement in costly foreign wars. In particular, he said he could work with Russia and saw no need for the continual war rhetoric coming out of every Western government. Obviously this plays well with those who can¡¯t afford to feed their families. The money will be spent on them, not bombs. But is it even possible to reduce the US military commitment, with so many bases, so many troops employed, so many weapons which will be manufactured and sold regardless? Trump may well find that the best way to stop foreign wars is to buy up all the weapons so that potential enemies don¡¯t get them. The War on Terror would greatly diminish if the US didn¡¯t supply arms to its favourite terrorists whilst pretending to fight them. But there is a vast industry devoted to maintaining armament and troop levels, which can only be justified by fighting wars against enemies real or imagined . So how would Trump go about achieving such a goal? Trump and his supporters are sons and daughters of the Bolsheviks. Convinced they are right, they think they can say what they like, do what they like and everyone else just has to put up with it because any opponent is part of the corrupt Establishment. It is no coincidence that Nigel Farage, former leader of UKIP and the main proponent of the UK leaving the European Union, has described Trump¡¯s victory as a ¡° Supersized Brexit . Farage¡¯s supporters behave the same way: everyone they don¡¯t like hasn¡¯t got the right to an opinion anymore, because they lost, and were inherently bad to begin with. Based on all we have seen so far, if someone stands in the way of Trump¡¯s ambitions as president they will be told that they are holdovers from a corrupt system, serving masters who are now enemies of the people, and must therefore be removed. In order to get rid of them he would have to use extralegal measures in many cases, and deny them an opinion or another job. The ¡°people¡± Trump would be referring to are the dispossessed whose votes he courted, who by definition don¡¯t have levers of power of their own. It hardly gives those people more power to demonise certain individuals on presidential say-so, but that is all Trump has offered so far, or may ever be capable of offering. Trump has enjoyed spreading hatred of various minority groups. As many commentators have pointed out, he has broken all the usual rules of presidential candidate conduct and got away with it. But this simply makes anyone a potential victim, and encourages such behaviour to go on unchecked. A system which was there long before a here-today-gone-tomorrow politician has all the levers his supporters don¡¯t to maintain itself. But if attacked, it will have no alternative but to fight fire with fire. A battle for control fought behind the scenes would empower Trump¡¯s supporters even less, whilst not addressing the specific problems which made them see Trump as the solution. Not beating them, only joining them This presidential election campaign was the ugliest within living memory. This played into Trump¡¯s hands: it brought those who were told they couldn¡¯t behave like that into the mainstream, and Trump as the outsider reaped the benefit. But it also created the expectation that this will be followed through: if you start such a process, you are expected to finish it. A poll taken just before Election Day showed that if Bernie Sanders had been running against Clinton and Trump he would have won by a landslide . Sanders supporters remain angry that he was denied the nomination by what they thought was an establishment fraud. Now Clinton has lost, they will make further efforts to ensure that anyone with Clinton credentials is neutralised so that they can present a more credible candidate in 2020, and will have much moral weight and grassroots sympathy behind this effort. As Clinton supporters will fight back in the same terms, the Democratic Party is likely to spend the next four years fighting itself rather than Trump, trying to exclude its own members in the same way Trump supporters want to get rid of everyone they don¡¯t like. The Republicans have the same problem. Trump was as offensive to his intra-party opponents as he was to Clinton. Those who think themselves ¡°real¡± Republicans will be emboldened by the pro-Sanders Democrats to seek to reclaim the party and its voters from the Trump constituency in the same way. This will generate more exclusion and counter-exclusion, even through Republican Congress versus Republican President battles, with each trying to show themselves to the public as More Republican Than Thou. Both Trump and Sanders supporters will now feel that they are the new ¡°Establishment¡± because they have been backed by their respective publics to overthrow the old one. Though both Trump and Sanders were the none-of-the-above candidates, they will be the above from now on. To justify their initial behaviour, and satisfy their support, they will have to be even worse Establishments than the ones they have removed, more intolerant, more exclusive ¡­more arbitrary. If the old guard is going to come back, they will have no choice but to adopt the same tactics. The choice at the next election will be between groups of battle-hardened intolerants who are more interested in serving their friends and stuffing their enemies than in the disaffected people in their midst. Trump has not overthrown the failed political Establishment and methods which created the disaffection he has exploited, he has confirmed their validity. Trump may change the personnel, but the Establishment will be the same animal, all the more dangerous for its delusions to the contrary.

The massive upset victory of this charismatic non-politician is crystallizing into a very divisive situation in the United States and in Europe, as EU leaders and NATO nations paint a geo-political picture of gloom and doom for us. However negative the picture may seem though, the shiny side of this leadership coin shows a glowing promise. Here¡¯s my take on what is about to happen when Donald Trump is inaugurated. Donald Trump did not win this election on any of the bases which Clinton¡¯s supporters profess. This is crucial to accept if we are to understand what is about to happen. Trump is not a bigot, a racist, nor is he some misogynistic woman hater. Trump is a product of both American progress and to an extend hyper-capitalism. His ¡°locker room¡± talk resonates no more resoundingly than his anti-establishment diatribe against the Washington elites. For those who have watched him over the years, it is so clear the man just says what he thinks at the moment. He said he would ¡°drain the swamp¡± of politically corrupt in Washington, and I think he is about to. He also said , if he was elected, he would install a special prosecutor to investigate and indict Hillary Clinton for her part in illegal activities. Those out there demonstrating do not fully understand ¡°who¡± it is there are demonstrating on behalf of, nor do they understand the breadth of criminality and malfeasance Mr. Trump has suggested. WikiLeaks opened the investigation to the court of public opinion, and this is why Donald Trump is the President-elect now. I could enumerate the multiple statutes Mrs. Clinton breached while she was Secretary of State, but her alleged crimes and misdemeanors against the United States are not the reason the Democrats lost. I could list the multitude of lies the Podesta emails proved, and how Hillary Clinton told Congress, the media, the FBI, and the atmosphere of crooked dealings she and the Democrats created, but the American people did not shun her for lying to them either. Politicians lie like water flows with gravity. The American people voted for Donald Trump because the system in place the last 25 years failed them. There¡¯s no need for a history lesson in order for me to prove my contention here. When George Herbert Walker Bush met with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev just after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the people of the world drew in a deep breath of possibility and potential. The promise was further illuminated in 1991, but the fall of the Soviet Union that was supposed to set free all the peoples of all the nations, it was never the plan. Almost simultaneously with his handshake with Gorbachev, Bush and his backers were steeled for the first invasion of Iraq. Bush¡¯s part in lighting the fuse on today¡¯s destabilization bomb was not his greatest betrayal of the American people though. Not many political analysts these days talk about George H.W. Bush¡¯s role in NAFTA, but step toward globalism ruined a hundred million lives and the dreams attached to them within a few short years. NAFTA, later set in place by Bill Clinton, destroyed the United States as a manufacturing power. Not only did millions lose their jobs, the globalization strategies keyed to NAFTA would later cause the global economic and military conflicts we see right now. An easy way of seeing this is by watching the march of NATO across Eastern Europe toward the doorstep of Russia. I can show you how Bill Clinton¡¯s administration got Yugoslavia out of the US hegemony¡¯s way. Clinton left office as one of only two US Presidents to have been through impeachment proceedings, and after having paved the way to the coming Iraq invasion. Showing the collusion in between Clinton¡¯s successor George W. Bush, Britain¡¯s Tony Blair, and Europe¡¯s leadership in what became known as the ¡°Bush Doctrine¡±, which amounted to ¡°Democratic regime change¡±. The Afghanistan War, the war and occupation of Iraq, the later Georgian War, Barack Obama¡¯s part in Ukraine, then Arab Spring, Gaddafi, Assad and Syria, the spread of this quasi-democratic movement is well documented by the trail of blood and misery left in its path. Whether the reader wishes to see the march of these successive administrations as complicit or circumstantial participants in this is irrelevant. In the long view the United States¡¯ domestic and global policies have failed billions of people. Furthermore, on some individual level, each and every one of us has felt these failures. This is true of the protesters from Austin to Washington today. These Hillary supporters are by and large, just the pawns of the globalists who pay for play via the US Treasury, and who now fund the very upheaval against President-elect Trump. The Hillary Clinton ¡°upset¡± is a far bigger paradigm than anyone is telling us. At this point some readers are already asking; ¡°So where is that glowing promise?¡± Donald Trump is in the process of emptying not only the ¡°Washington swamp¡±, but the European one as well. Before you object, please consider what it means for a powerful outsider to enter this game of crisis-d¨¦tente. Look at how EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is expressing the panic of European leadership in this comment this week: ¡°We will need to teach the president-elect what Europe is and how it works.¡± News that NATO is losing it over the Trump presidency is brought into context if we look at how NATO is trying to establish Moscow as the bitter foe again. I recall something Mr. Putin said to the Valdai Conference in Sochi in 2014, when announced; ¡°Playtime is over¡±. The Russian president was talking about backroom deals and underhanded dealings geo-policy makers had been engaging in for decades, and how he was not engaging in them any longer. This is vital for understanding Mr. Trump¡¯s position with regard to positivity toward Russia and China. The globalists who have run this show for decades are now faced with powerful opponents to their plans. All of this is irrefutable, and only the minute details remain to be seen. The worst nightmare of the billionaires who have benefited from world chaos is now elected. Imagine now what will come out in a Hillary Clinton investigation without the Obama Department of Justice to block! Donald Trump has at his fingertips every underhanded shift, every bit of NSA intelligence, every USAID or CIA penny shoveled to ISIL, or to some unscrupulous EU official. Hillary and Bill Clinton, the Bushs, Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, Tony Blair, Cameron, billionaires like George Soros and his NGOs, the whole grimy and messy swamp of leadership corruption is now in the hands of a guy who builds skyscrapers and golf courses. Somebody outside the ¡°club¡± is in the White House and nobody knows what he is going to do. No Rockefeller millions put him there. No Soros funding promoted him, and no corporate media voiced a kind word about him. The opposition to Donald Trump did every dirty, stinking, rotten deed they could to ensure he lost, but fed up America said ¡°no¡±. The world¡¯s geo-political reptiles are losing their collective minds today. Soros and MoveOn.org, the neo-socialists marching in Berlin are organizing a popular uprising, but the Trump power base is more firm. The same frustrated American that lost his manufacturing job and pension to NAFTA, he is the neighbor of that redneck veteran Obama sent to lose in Afghanistan. The shining hope I speak of is in the pragmatic realism of Trump, Putin, and any leader compelled to actually serve a people. Here is how I see it playing out. As I looked at Vladimir Putin¡¯s Instagram account today, I could not help but notice he and former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi walking side-by-side in the woods. The reason I mention this is because the media in the west has already jumped on a fear, and a meme, in comparing Berlusconi to Trump. One of Mr. Putin¡¯s friends, Berlusconi is a fascinating and powerful ally in Italy, a nation increasingly reticent on Germany¡¯s and America¡¯s control of Europe. The neo-fascist liberals who were so ¡°all in¡± to get Clinton elected, now they are in chaotic disarray now over politicians like Matteo Renzi, whom Berlusconi backs. To cut short here, the Trump-Putin cohesion the far-left tried to use against the billionaire property mogul, is the same bright potential that can rescue the planet. Europe is only an extension of Washington, London, Berlin, and Paris these days, and the EU that never was has scores of nations restless for change. Trump is the catalyst for this change whether he choose to try Hillary Clinton or not. You see Trump is a businessman first, and philosopher poet last. The bottom line here is, peace with Russia and carry on business, or stand trial for betraying a billion people. These protests, the NATO and EU ¡°warnings¡± to Trump, these indications tell me just how corrupt this system was.

They cannot provide for the needs and well being of the people, guarantee them peace, nor act in effective concert to stop and reverse the rapid global warming that these have economies created and which will utterly destroy civilisation in our lifetime. The crisis in capitalism has been evident for a century and resulted in two world wars and threatens a third. The remaining socialist countries that provide another model of economic development and another view of humanity cannot reach their potential as they are surrounded by an international system of capital that cannot tolerate any interference in its search for profit and aggressively undermines and attacks peoples who have chosen the socialist path. We have seen what the socialist republics in the USSR had to suffer when they succeeded. Only a return to a mixed economy, a revival of some state industries, and the defeat of the gangsters that first appeared as the representatives of capital have improved conditions for the people of those republics, in particular Russia. The new Russian state still holds onto some of the principles, the hopes for international law and sovereignty of nations and peoples, that were a defining characteristic of the Soviet Union. It still believes that the world¡¯s peoples are all one and should live in cooperation with each other. The Communist Party and other left parties are still strong and have an influence among the people and the government. The lingering legacy of the socialist epoch has produced a leadership that seems, at least in comparison to those in other capitalist countries, rational and even, in some ways, enlightened. But still, Russia is also now part of the capitalist international and subject to its laws. So are the people of the United States and the other NATO countries. Those laws are cruel and criminal. They stipulate that to make more profit working people have to be paid less, for profit does not come out of thin air as western economists would have it; it comes from the value added to products by labour power that is forced from workers without compensation. In other words, the profit is ours but they take it. This fact dictates that the only way in which President-elect Trump can ¡°bring back jobs to America¡± is to lower wages to the level that we now see in China, or worse Africa where workers are paid about a dollar a day. American companies moved their production out of the US and Canada with ¡°free¡± trade to cheap labour markets to increase their profit. They are not going to return to the USA just because Donald Trump promised the people that they will. To return and pay higher wages, even those which are relatively low by the standards of the 50¡¯s and 60¡¯s, is to return and lose money. If Trump is serious about ¡°creating jobs¡± then the only way he can succeed is to force the cost of labour down, that is reduce wages. We can expect more attacks on unions and union organising, a freeze or a lowering of the minimum wage, an influx of more cheap labour from Mexico and other countries. His promise to ¡°build a wall¡± along the Mexican border is a lot of hot air, for to build it will raise the cost of business. Too many small industries and services in the US depend on this cheap labour and its presence depresses wages for the rest. We have seen this happen across the western world since the capitalists seized power in the USSR. As soon as that occurred every western country began the roll back of all the gains that working people had achieved after the Second World War. This roll-back, this rapid lowering of the standard of living of the mass of the people, in every country, followed by recessions, overproduction and more war as they fight for resources, using our money and bodies, is accelerating. The rise of the far right parties in Europe and the United States reflects this decline in the lives of the majority. Since the mass media has effectively convinced too many that the socialist path has failed, or as in the United States, cannot even be considered, people seek a remedy with the right-wing populist demagogues who promise them a chicken in every pot and peace in our time. We have seen where this leads; to nationalism and to war and these are always accompanied by xenophobia, racism, and other scapegoating techniques to divert attention from the root causes of the situation and create the atmosphere for war. Those who hope for better relations between Russia and the United States have the right to hope, but the international situation has not changed overnight. The United States still seeks to dominate the world, and Trump¡¯s promise to ¡°make America great again¡± in contrast to Clinton¡¯s ¡°America is great¡± bragging, reflects the struggle inside the United States between those who think it can still succeed in dominating the world with its current structure and resources and those who have decided that a transformation has to take place for the United States to stay top dog in the world. The internal struggle in the United States has been a bitter one and it still is not settled which faction of the ruling elite will assume the power needed to make such a transformation possible. But the only people to benefit from that struggle, a struggle in which the people are and will be used as pawns to support one faction or the other, will be the already powerful and the already wealthy. The mass of the people will be the playthings of people in dark shadows and will turn on each other before they expose those shadows to the light. The American election was not about left or right, for there is no effective, organised left in that country. There are only degrees of the right. It was not about making lives better for its people. A large section of the voting population did not vote for there was nothing for them to vote for. The remainder took part in the theatre, played their part, few understanding the role they played and are still playing. The world stands on edge, wondering if we have been saved from the corrupt, venal war-monger that is Clinton or shackled with another corrupt nationalist reactionary in Trump, who will send us all down the same violent path. But, of course, both are true. For the world crisis continues and can only continue when leaders use ¡°terrorism¡± to play upon the peoples¡¯ weaknesses and fears, when the peoples doubts are used against them, when a man like Trump wears a mask of peace for one sucker and then is just a businessman for another, a straight talker, misunderstood; who knows how to get to this man with his wallet, this woman with her hatred for her boss, this one through ignorance and that one through the bribe, while offering everything because the offering¡¯s cheap, but who works for those satisfied with nothing less than making the world their personal domain. In reality the world stands on edge because the dominant ideology in the west offers no solutions to the crisis because it is itself the crisis. Capital cannot rule for the benefit of the people. It does not matter what brand of capitalism they are selling. It produces for profit not for need. The only way out of this crisis is for working people to start to once again sit down with each other and discuss what the cause of their problems is, and what needs to be done to change that. In Europe, and Latin America, Asia, and Africa, the left has a rich and proud history that most have not forgotten and so, perhaps, we can hope they will push back against the forces of the right that are being drawn out of the mud to fool and oppress the people. But in the United States where the left is weak and in disarray and the far right is rising without effective opposition, the situation is very bleak, for the American election did not resolve the crisis but only increased it; and in reaction I can only repeat what the great American poet, Stephen Vincent Benet, once wrote, ¡°Life have mercy on us.¡± Christopher Black is an international criminal lawyer based in Toronto, he is a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada and he is known for a number of high-profile cases involving human rights and war crimes, especially for the online magazine ¡°New Eastern Outlook.¡± Popular Articles ",english,2016-11-18T10:15:18.784+02:00,journal-neo.org,RU,79662,The Trump Election: Life Have Mercy On Us | New Eastern Outlook,0.029,http://journal-neo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Trump-supporters-want-guns-in-bathrooms-_-660x400-300x250.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Turkey and Saudi Arabia are unwilling to follow the Trump announced policy on Syria, and are now planning on redoubling their efforts to support ISIS. In order to avoid an obvious confrontation with the US, which has been backing all forces fighting the Assad government including ISIS and other organizations officially deemed ¡°terrorist,¡± both Turkey and Saudi Arabia have gone to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for help. Netanyahu, through back channels, has told all regional powers, including Iran, that any deal making with the US should go through him. Iran has already been given a price to derail Trump¡¯s promised scrapping of the nuclear settlement. Netanyahu has promised them that there will be no new sanctions so long as Iran outsources key areas of their military modernization through Israel. Israel has traditionally been a conduit for restricted US military technology transfers to ¡°listed¡± nations. Where it is assumed Trump made a huge error was when he stated he would consider backing Assad and Russia against Israeli backed terrorists. It is unlikely that Assad, who has long experience with Netanyahu breaking his word, cut the same deal with Netanyahu that Iran has. With a permanent Russian military presence in Syria and Assad rebuilding his nation after the defeat of ISIS, efforts will certainly return to removing Israel from the illegal occupation of the Golan Heights. You see, the deal cut to allow Israel to take the rest of the West Bank, unrestricted bulldozing of Palestinian homes and unrestricted ethnic cleansing across the rest of defacto Israel (including Judea and Samaria, designated by the UN as Palestinian homeland and making up 40% of pre-1967 Israel) is supported by everyone. The Saudi¡¯s and Qatar are cutting down aid to the Palestinians, Jordan has long viewed them as the primary threat to their security, far more than Israel. (Jordan is an Israeli puppet) Where there has been significant change is how Assad now looks on the Palestinians who quickly joined ISIS, extending their payoffs to fund mercenary operations using Hamas against the Assad government. All of this is made possible by Israel¡¯s free transit of Hamas fighters into Syria and into Jordan to CIA training centers. Netanyahu will now be able to use his newfound relationship with Iran, due to its clandestine nature, to manipulate financial markets at will, ramping up tensions for domestic consumption, and playing Donald Trump like a cheap fiddle. The real question is how Russia will deal with this over the long term. Despite the big talk from Trump, for America to ramp up ground forces inside Syria, while assisting Turkey in moves against the Damascus government, will not pass the ¡°sniff test¡± in Moscow. Turkey is actively threatening the territorial integrity of both Iraq and Syria and Turkish moves into both nations is directly aimed at securing oil and gas reserves. With Russia and Iran blocking Turkey from seizing the massive gas fields near Aleppo, these are virgin finds, far larger than the offshore reserves Israel is currently accessing, Turkey will drive against the Euphrates oil reserves west of Raqqa and even as far south as Deir Ezzor, another oil rich region of Syria. In Iraq, Turkey is working closely with the Erbil government to seize the Kirkuk oil fields, some of the largest in the world. Peshmerga forces have been ethnically cleansing this area, which is nowhere near Mosul, as key to their efforts in support of the war on ISIS and the taking of Mosul, or so they claim. Despite initial announcements of Erbil backed Kurds, really surrogates of Turkey, advancing on Mosul, these forces have, in fact, turned East and are now driving into Iraqi Sunni areas, ethnically cleansing the Arab populations. What is revealed by this is the long hidden relationship between the Kurds in Erbil and ISIS and how both have been controlled by Erdogan. When Russia showed the world satellite photos of 12,000 oil trucks entering Turkey from Iraq, what was not told is that those trucks, for the last 200 miles of their journey were guarded by Peshmerga forces. Most ISIS oil stolen from Iraq was taken from Kurdish controlled regions, not by ISIS at all, marketed to the world out of the Kurdish capitol of Erbil and trucked to pipeline depots in Turkey through Kurdish, ISIS and even Turkish controlled regions of Iraq. ISIS in fact got very little of the oil revenue but in fact only facilitated transit of stolen oil by the Erbil Kurds and their Turkish partners including, according to reports, the son of Erdogan. The real question here is what will Russia allow? Will it allow Turkey and Saudi Arabia to dismember Syria? Will it remain silent on Turkish efforts to support ISIS while running military operations against them at the same time, or so the world is being told though no one has actually seen any of it. Sources in Damascus have long claimed that the ISIS occupation of areas of Northern Syria currently allegedly under Turkish assault were always controlled by Turkey. Will Putin allow Netanyahu to play his game, which includes betrayal of Russia? How far will Netanyahu get before Russia asserts herself militarily? What Netanyahu is also saying is that he has influence, even control, over the Kiev government. We don¡¯t know if Netanyahu has promised to have Trump recognize Russia¡¯s control of Crimea. This would give considerable leverage over Russia, perhaps enough to endanger Russian support of Syria, which Netanyahu must see as a threat. It will be necessary to watch events in the region. If Trump fails to confront both Turkey and Saudi Arabia over their support of ISIS against the Damascus government, this will represent a massive foreign policy defeat early in his administration. Note that Trump was elected under a cloud, with a significant electoral vote against him and a ¡°win¡± based on statistical anomalies that are unprecedented, suggesting something that may well bring down his government at some time in the future.

While US leaders criticize Iran and Syria for alleged human rights violations, the entire world can see that the US allies in the region are serial human rights violators. Israel has been widely condemned for its treatment of Palestinians. Saudi Arabia is a country where even the basic notion of human rights does not exist. The Kingdom is an absolute monarchy where people can still be executed by beheading or crucifixion in the 21st century. Crimes punishable by death under the Saudi regime include ¡°sorcery¡± and ¡°insulting the King.¡± Under Saudi law, the people are not citizens with rights, but rather ¡°subjects¡± who are essentially the King¡¯s property. Qatar is yet another repressive regime. Like Saudi Arabia, it is an absolute monarchy, where a King serves as the unelected autocrat. Bahrain is known not only for its lack of democratic structures, but for its repression of the Shia Muslim majority who frequently take to the streets, demanding their rights. The United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Jordan, and almost every other US-aligned regime in the Arab world has a primitive political system, centered on an autocratic monarchy. These regimes are known to torture, behead, flog, repress free speech, oppress religious minorities, and do all kinds of things US leaders claim to oppose. This does not prevent the United States from selling weapons to these regimes, or from purchasing their oil. This also does not prevent the USA from establishing military bases on their soil, and otherwise coddling them. In fact, the Financial Times describes how the United Arab Emirates is becoming a beloved ¡°tax haven¡± for the rich and powerful in the western world. While western leaders love to talk about human rights, they have no problem with autocratic emirates handling their money . The Roots of Wahabbi Terrorism More shockingly, the involvement of these regimes in terrorism has not deterred US support. It took 15 years for the classified 28 pages of the 9/11 Commission report to be released. The pages revealed that Saudi government officials had collaborated with the 9/11 hijackers. It furthermore revealed that Saudi Arabia had been uncooperative and offered minimal support to US officials with their investigations during the aftermath of the attacks. The Saudi Royal family owes its reign to the British Empire. During the 1800s the British discovered that the House of Saud were useful allies against the Ottoman Empire, and were more than willing to sell their oil at a reasonable price. The Saudi monarchy professes a particularly conservative brand of Islam known as ¡°Wahabbism.¡± While not every Wahabbi has been involved in terrorism, Al-Queda, ISIS, Al-Nusra, Osama Bin Laden, Omar Mateen, and nearly every Middle-Eastern or Central-Asian terrorist who has menaced the world in recent years has been an adherent of Wahabbism. Wahabbism is particularly anti-Western and anti-American. Opponents of the Saudi ideology it often call it ¡°Takfirism,¡± a term that refers to Wahabbi¡¯s willingness to kill other Muslims with whom they disagree. The relationship between Wahabbi fanatics and Britain¡¯s wealthy has not ended. A recent article in the Financial Times describes how British Houses of Finance now specialize in ¡°Islamic Banking.¡± While many Islamic scholars describe the very concept as fraudulent, many financial institutions are accommodating sultans, emirates, and princes who adhere to strict Wahabbi laws. Islam forbids lending money for interest, so many financial institutions have invented loopholes with hidden fees, investment returns, and other mechanisms that can accommodate strict adherents . During the 1980s, the CIA worked with the heir of a wealthy Saudi construction dynasty to build a Wahabbi army. Osama bin Laden was sent to Afghanistan to build an army of ¡°Mujihadeen¡± to topple the People¡¯s Democratic Party. The USA worked closely with the fanatical Wahabbi terrorists to battle the Marxist government of Afghanistan and their Soviet allies. Currently, the United States works with Saudi Arabia to fund a Wahabbi insurgency against the secular Syrian Arab Republic. ISIS and Al-Nusra are known to be terrorists inspired by the Saudi ideology. The Saudis have been caught directly helping them out. Among the US backed ¡°moderate rebels,¡± many Wahabbis can also be found. Most of the various US-aligned autocracies in the Middle East can be linked to Wahabbi forces in Syria. Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and other regimes have made the goal of ¡°regime change¡± in Syria a priority, and many ISIS fighters have emerged from their respective populations. Is The Tide Turning? While the past three presidencies of Bush, Obama, and Clinton have involved massive coddling of the Saudi regime, Donald Trump often spoke against Saudi Arabia during his Presidential campaign. Furthermore, in a recent move, the US Congress dramatically overrode Barack Obama¡¯s veto, and passed the controversial JASTA bill, allowing victims of terrorism to sue the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in US courts. While Trump often appealed to ignorant and Islamophobic sentiments among Americans, he also appealed to an isolationist desire to stop meddling around the world. Trump made fighting ISIS, the Wahabbi extremist group unleashed amid US-Saudi regime change efforts, a key plank of his campaign. Will Trump live up to his words? Will the USA end its alliance with Pro-Wahabbi autocratic regimes that are linked to terrorism? Though Trump spoke against the Saudis and talked of fighting ISIS, his campaign included reckless denunciations of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Trump¡¯s speeches often seemed to lump Iran in with ISIS, ignoring the fact that Iranian Revolutionary Guards are on the battlefield each and every day, risking their lives to defeat ISIS. Iran is greatly threatened by ISIS terrorism. ISIS and most Wahabbis consider the Islamic Republic of Iran to be led by ¡°Shia Apostates.¡± ISIS and other anti-government forces in Syria have recruited fighters from around the world on the basis of toppling Syrian President Bashar Assad because of his Alawi faith, which Wahabbis consider to be a variation of Shia apostasy. 
Contradictory Middle East Positions For too long, the USA has been targeting secular, nationalist governments like the Baathist regimes of Iraq and Syria, the Islamic Republic of Iran, or Gaddafi¡¯s Libya. In doing so they have been passively helping and strengthening the bloodthirsty Wahabbi fanatics who these regimes have held back, and whose ideological foundation is promoted by Saudi Arabia. If Trump is serious about stopping ISIS and the surrounding wave of Wahabbi terrorism, he will immediately end the US financial and military relationship with the Saudi regime, as well as the nearby, pro-Wahabbi autocracies. Furthermore, Trump will need to end his irresponsible demonization of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and join with the Iranians, the Russians, the Syrian government, and China in the fight against ISIS terrorism. If Trump were to do this, it would be one of the most dramatic shifts ever seen in US foreign policy. During his campaign, Trump has taken two somewhat contradictory positions in relation to the Middle East. While he has denounced Saudi Arabia and talked about how US ¡°regime change¡± policies have strengthened terrorism, he has also repeated the anti-Iranian talking points of Netanyahu, and spoken with great admiration for Israel. Israel has been the greatest direct beneficiary of the US policy in the Middle East. Each regime the US has targeted in the region¨CSyria, Iraq, and Iran¨Chave been outspoken opponents of Israel who directly support Palestinian resistance. Meanwhile, the Wahabbi-linked autocrats denounce Israel in words, but do very little to threaten its existence or strength. Israel¡¯s primary enemies, Iran and Syria, are also the primary target of the Wahabbi fanatics and the Saudi monarchy. Israeli and Saudi Arabia may denounce each other, but their foreign policies both center on hostility to what the Saudis call ¡°the Shia crescent.¡± Regarding the Middle East, the new President will be forced to decide whether he seeks to continue aligning US and Israel foreign policies, and targeting Iran and Syria, or whether he wants to end Wahabbi terrorism, and stop cooperating with the regimes actively linked to it. Trump is often perceived as quite unpredictable. Whichever choice he makes, it is likely to surprise many people. Caleb Maupin is a political analyst and activist based in New York.

The scale of this is no accident. There is no doubt whatsoever that along with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States picking up the bill, pumping hundreds of millions into Raytheon Corporation for TOW and Stinger missiles, the arms dealers in Ukraine, Israel and Turkey need a smackdown for their role in war crimes that have killed 400,000 Syrian civilians, according to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory. Then there is this group itself, the disinformation news services for ISIS and al Nusra, working with Reuters, to cover for war crimes and help stage murderous gas attacks on civilians. This organization and the pet pro-ISIS media, who were very much a part of the terrorist war on Syria, need to be sent to Guantanamo for a dose of that promised ¡°much worse than waterboarding¡± torture. Yes, America is back in the torture business in a big way but Trump promises that this time it will be the real terrorists and not poor kidnapped cab drivers and patsys like those that filled the prisons of Poland and the torture rooms of Gadhafi¡¯s Libya. One might question how someone as close to Israel as Trump is may be able to clean up the problems that Israel is and will continue to be at the heart of. This and other issues, the newfound love of Russia by a president elect who has surrounded himself with Russia-haters, perhaps time and a reality check will make this all clear at some time in the future. We can only hope. But we look to Syria now. The truth is a lie and up is down, or so it seems. Let¡¯s look at Aleppo, or so we are told were one to read the Guardian or watch CNN. A humanitarian group called ¡°White Helmets¡± saves civilians from massacre or is this true? What if I told you that the ¡°White Helmets¡± are members of terror groups, enforcers, torturers and ¡°beheaders¡± who perform impromptu ¡°street theatre, killing babies one minute and pretending to save them the next. Again we ask, will President Trump hunt down these war criminals along with the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, will he force Turkey out of Syria or stop the slaughter of the people of Yemen by Saudi Arabia? Conversely, he has ¡°green-lighted¡± Israel¡¯s cleansing of her remaining Palestinian population, estimated at up to 55% of Israel¡¯s citizenry. Where will they go, with American closed to immigration and expelling millions? It¡¯s the last days of the Obama administration and the mainstream press has let out the stops. Staged photos of the ¡°Aleppo holocaust¡± are everywhere, the Reuters photographs of bloodied infants and carefully quaffed ¡°white helmet¡± first responders are everywhere. Of course there are no ¡°white helmets,¡± not wanting to spoil that hair and makeup job. These photos have been around for years, always shifting the blame for US backed gas attacks and rocketing, with a claimed 400,000 Syrian civilians killed, on the government and their alleged ¡°barrel bombs.¡± It is all too little, too late, there is nothing that can and will be done, no last minute American invasion of Syria, joining the Turks who are already there, a last ditch attempt to save the ISIS/al Nusra ¡°head choppers¡± from the Russian juggernaut. With General Michael Flynn taking over as National Security Advisor for President-elect Trump, whatever else the Trump administration may or may not be able to do, Flynn knows the Syrian war. He knows who has been supplying the terrorists, that being Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey and he has a well-established understanding of Russia¡¯s role and has long made his support of Russia in Syria clear. The key to how this will turn out will be how much power Flynn will have, formerly direction of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Trump, while looking for ¡°military types¡± to bolster up his own lack of background in that area, except as a student in a military prep school, had initially turned to retired Major General Paul Vallely, founder of Stand Up America, a militia group advocating the violent overthrow of the US government. Vallely has told associates that Trump shortlisted him for Vice President but was passed over. Vallely is featured in a YouTube video allegedly visiting Aleppo. There he is filmed meeting with rebel leaders, some of whom are currently members of ISIS. Some of those likely to oppose Trump¡¯s policies in his own party, names like Graham and McCain, are alleged to have been involved in trafficking stolen oil from Iraq, dating back to as early as 2004 and continuing to this day, via ISIS. This theft of Iraqi and now Syrian crude as well, starting with the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, moved oil into Turkey by both truck and pipeline and eventually into waiting tankers, particularly Exxon and BP, loaded under the supervision of the Turkish Navy at Ceyhan in the Mediterranean. VT¡¯s Alex Powers was there in Baghdad with Brenner and I was in Erbil. For years, up to 40% of Iraqi oil was never paid for, some passed on in bribes in Iraq, tens of millions to key members of congress while billions more laundered into the black accounts of the oil companies. There it joined the tens of billions that were spent to arm an Iraqi army that never existed and to build a nation left it ruins, but we are getting ahead of ourselves. Will the US be able to take a credible stand without bringing the Bush era criminals to the dock? Is ISIS simply a continuity of Bush era policy, Sunni and Baathist militarists loaded up with retired contract US and Israeli officers, Turkish, Saudi and Qatari spies, funded by oil companies and armed by Raytheon? Will Trump expose the ¡°re-death¡± of Osama bin Laden, with a well recorded first death on December 13, 2001, even reported by Fox News in the US and a second public killing and burial at sea without a shred of evidence, obviously done as cheap political theatre. Will Trump expose 9/11 as promised even though the finger pointing at Saudi Arabia that now comes out of Washington will inexorably lead to their Israeli friends as well? Without this delve into truth, can the books ever be balanced once and for all?

Geopolitics & Tradition,"Alexander Dugin El Pantano va a convertirse en el nuevo nombre de la secta globalista, de los adeptos de la sociedad abierta, de los man¨ªacos del lgbt, del ej¨¦rcito de Soros, de los posthumanistas, etc. Drenar el pantano no es s¨®lo el imperativo categ¨®rico norteamericano. Es un desaf¨ªo global para todos nosotros. Cada pueblo est¨¢ ahora bajo el poder de su propio pantano. Todos juntos debemos comenzar la lucha contra el pantano ruso, el pantano franc¨¦s, el pantano alem¨¢n y as¨ª sucesivamente. Necesitamos purgar nuestras sociedades de la influencia del pantano. As¨ª que en lugar de pelear entre nosotros, vamos a drenarlo juntos. ?Los drenadores del mundo entero deben estar unidos! 
El otro punto es que el antiamericanismo ha terminado. No porque estuviera equivocado, sino exactamente por lo contrario: porque el pueblo estadounidense inici¨® la revoluci¨®n precisamente contra ese aspecto de los EEUU que todos odiamos. Ahora, la ¨¦lite gobernante europea, as¨ª como parte de la ¨¦lite rusa (que todav¨ªa es liberal) no puede ser culpada (como antes) de ser demasiado pro-americana. Debe ser culpada de ahora en adelante por ser lo que es: una pandilla corrupta, pervertida y codiciosa de banksters y destructores de culturas, tradiciones e identidades. As¨ª que vamos a drenar el pantano europeo. Basta de Hollande, Merkel, Bruselas. Europa para los europeos. Los Soros y su secta deben ser juzgados p¨²blicamente. 
El pantano es a partir de ahora un fen¨®meno extraterritorial. Exactamente como una red terrorista internacional. El pantano est¨¢ en todas partes y en ninguna parte. Ayer, el centro del pantano, su n¨²cleo, estaba situado en los EEUU. Hoy, ya no. Es la oportunidad para todos nosotros para que comencemos a cazarlos. El pantano no tiene ya una forma manifiesta y regionalmente fija. Sin embargo, existe y sigue siendo muy, muy poderoso. Pero su car¨¢cter anti-nacional ahora es evidente, expl¨ªcito. El pantano no se esconde ya detr¨¢s de Norteam¨¦rica. Se ha exiliado. ?D¨®nde?, ?a Canad¨¢?, ?a Europa?, ?a ucrania?, A otros planetas donde algunos actores y actrices dopados prometieron emigrar en el caso de la victoria de Trump. As¨ª que ahora es el momento de cumplir la promesa. Parece como el rapto globalista. Ahora son absorbidos en el no-espacio, la u-topia. En la tierra de la utop¨ªa liberal, en tierra de nadie. Somos testigos de la desterritorializaci¨®n del pantano, de la ¨¦lite globalista, del Gobierno Mundial. ?Cu¨¢l es la estructura del pantano? En primer lugar, es la ideolog¨ªa, el liberalismo. Necesitamos el juicio de Nuremberg sobre el liberalismo: la ¨²ltima ideolog¨ªa pol¨ªtica totalitaria de la Modernidad. Cerremos esta p¨¢gina de la historia. Segundo: El pantano es una cultura post-modernista especial. Est¨¢ basada en la descomposici¨®n de cualquier entidad, por la digitalizaci¨®n, el esquizomorfismo obligatorio y as¨ª sucesivamente. Drenarlo significa restaurar la unidad apol¨ªnea del arte. El arte debe volver al holismo. Tercero: el capitalismo transnacional global. Es el motor material del pantano. Es el cr¨¦dito y el Sistema de Reserva Federal haciendo cuentas verdes envenenadas. Tenemos que terminar con todo esto y regresar al sector real y al enfoque mercantilista. 
Yo sugerir¨ªa redescubrir las ideas de Pitirim Sorokin. Vio la din¨¢mica social de la historia como una cadena de paradigmas sociales: ideacional, idealista y sensata. Ideacional es la dominaci¨®n absoluta del esp¨ªritu sobre la materia, el ascetismo y la subyugaci¨®n violenta del mundo material a la aspiraci¨®n espiritual y religiosa. El tipo idealista es equilibrado y basado en la coexistencia armoniosa del esp¨ªritu y la materia, donde la parte espiritual es ligeramente dominante pero no exclusiva (como en el tipo ideacional). El tipo sensato de la sociedad es la dominaci¨®n de la materia sobre el esp¨ªritu, del cuerpo sobre el alma. El tipo sensato de la sociedad es el pantano. Y recientemente parec¨ªa que ""sensato"" y ""Norteam¨¦rica"" eran sin¨®nimos. Despu¨¦s de Trump todo es diferente. Ahora lo sensato es global y ex-c¨¦ntrico. Hay una especie de "" translatio Imperii "" - a ninguna parte o bien a todas partes. 
Pero Sorokin hizo hincapi¨¦ en que la naturaleza c¨ªclica de la sociedad s¨®lo exige esta sucesi¨®n: ideacional-idealista-sensata. Despu¨¦s de sensata no puede seguir idealista. No hay una posible evoluci¨®n desde el pantano hasta el semi-pantano. Despu¨¦s del pantano viene el sol. El fuego, el Esp¨ªritu. El Esp¨ªritu en su forma radical, ideacional. As¨ª que para drenar el pantano necesitamos el fuego solar. El gran incendio. Debe ser en abundancia. 
El pantano y el fuego son dos elementos opuestos distribuidos a trav¨¦s de la tierra. La geopol¨ªtica se vuelve ahora vertical. Ambos est¨¢n en cualquier punto. El significado del lugar ahora es el impulso del proceso de drenaje del pantano. ?D¨®nde? Aqu¨ª y ahora. El pantano ya no es la hegemon¨ªa norteamericana, el presidente de Estados Unidos rechaza tal hegemon¨ªa. As¨ª que es la hegemon¨ªa "" tout court "", la hegemon¨ªa como tal, con un vac¨ªo puramente post-modernista en el centro. Estados Unidos es el extremo occidental del mundo. Es el espacio de la medianoche. Y all¨ª se alcanza el punto final de la ca¨ªda. As¨ª que el momento es el del cambio de los polos. Occidente se convierte en Oriente. Putin y Trump en dos rincones opuestos del planeta. En el siglo XX estos dos extremos fueron las formas m¨¢s radicales de la modernidad: capitalista y comunista. Dos monstruos apocal¨ªpticos, Leviat¨¢n y Behemoth. Ahora se convierten en dos promesas escatol¨®gicas: la Gran Rusia de Putin y Norteam¨¦rica en estado de liberaci¨®n por Trump. El siglo XXI finalmente ha comenzado.

There¡¯s a lot of talk in the Balkans about what sort of a leader Trump will be and how his foreign policy will impact on the region. Although he was only just elected last week and still has over two months to go before officially coming to power, it¡¯s already possible to make some predictions in attempting to answer those questions. Greeks In Government 
The strongest indication yet about what Trump¡¯s Balkan policy may look like comes from the appointment of Reince Priebus as his Chief of Staff. This prestigious and high-profile position will be occupied by a Greek Orthodox believer who was born to a Greek mother, so it can confidently be inferred that he has a strong sense of Greek identity which obviously plays to the Republic of Macedonia¡¯s disadvantage vis-¨¤-vis the name issue and other matters of mutual discord. The second factor playing in Greece¡¯s favor is the fact that Stephen K. Bannon was appointed at the same time as Trump¡¯s Chief Strategist. This is important because Bannon used to run the wildly successful alternative media outlet Breitbart just prior to taking on his mid-summer responsibilities as the CEO of Trump¡¯s campaign. One of the most popular writers on the site is Milo Yiannopoulos, an outspoken homosexual of Greek descent and someone who is not at all expected to be friendly to Macedonia or its culture of conservative values. Given Breitbart¡¯s closeness to the Trump Administration, writers such as Milo might exert a disproportionate influence on the President¡¯s policy formulation. Soros And Macedonia 
Neither Priebus, Bannon, nor Yiannopoulos are good for Macedonia, but on the other hand, the Trump team¡¯s antipathy to Color Revolution financier George Soros is well known and could play to the country¡¯s advantage. It¡¯s too early to tell, but with Soros practically declaring war on Trump and reorienting his focus towards the US and away from other parts of the world (at least for now), there¡¯s a chance that the NGO-driven Color Revolution tumult of approximately the last two years might finally be over for some time. It¡¯s also possible that Trump and his ¡°deep state¡± (the military, intelligence, and diplomatic bureaucracies) might even defeat Soros and remove him from power, thus rendering his networks null and void for some time. 
In such a case, this wouldn¡¯t necessarily mean the end of NGO-driven Hybrid War , but just that someone else might be tasked by the administration to replace him and take over his worldwide network. The visible change that this could produce would be that the message that future ¡°Soros¡±-connected organizations propagate in trying to gain more regime change recruits could decisively shift from the ¡°far left¡± to the ¡°far right¡±, especially if Trump¡¯s CIA realizes that it¡¯s a lot more effective to use this sort of narrative in exploiting the palpable zeitgeist than stubbornly sticking with a discredited and proven failure from the past. It¡¯s still too early to tell if this will happen or not, but the scenario isn¡¯t improbable and should at the very least be countenanced by all Macedonians seeking to predict the course of American policy towards their country. 
If one accounts for the influence that Greeks will have on the Trump Presidency and acknowledge that Soros might very well end up on the losing side in his War on Trump, then it¡¯s possible to forecast that the new American leader probably won¡¯t budge on the name issue, yet won¡¯t be as predisposed to resort to the same type of asymmetrical aggressions against Macedonia as his predecessor did. In short, Trump would be more reasonable than Obama, though he would still lean towards Greece if forced to choose. This is very relevant in terms of the bigger Balkan picture because it¡¯s likely that the businessman will engage in his trademark deal-making in trying to reach a ¡®gentleman¡¯s agreement¡¯ with Russia over establishing spheres of influence, and there¡¯s no way that the Balkans would be left out of this proposal. Spheres Of Influence The Greek Headquarters: 
The US will never peacefully cede its prevailing influence over any of the NATO states, so nobody should get their hopes up that this will happen under Trump. Greece will probably be the center point of the new administration¡¯s Balkan policy due to its energy significance with Balkan Stream, the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, and the future potential that it has for transiting Israeli gas from the Eastern Mediterranean Leviathan field to the EU. Moreover, Greece is regularly at odds with Turkey due to the latter¡¯s aggressive airspace violations in the eastern Aegean Sea, and the fierce opposition that all Greeks have to Turkish President Erdogan means that the country could become a useful base for covert destabilization operations against the multipolar-leaning leader who just barely survived a recent US coup against him. The ¡®Coastal Balkans¡¯ vs The ¡®Balkan Bubble¡¯: 
As for the rest of the Balkans, it was already expressed that the US will never ¡°hand over¡± any of the NATO states to Russia, so this essentially leaves just the non-NATO states as potentially falling under any prospective spheres of influence agreement with Russia. Therefore, only Bosnia, Serbia, and the Republic of Macedonia could conceivably play a part in this proposal. It¡¯s not likely that the Croat-Muslim Federation part of Bosnia would agree to their entire country being aligned with Moscow, so it¡¯s much more realistic that only Republika Srpska ¨C which already enjoys close political-strategic relations with Russia ¨C would be party to this tacit agreement. Serbia, too, would thus obviously be involved as well, as could the Republic of Macedonia, though the latter might once more find itself on the frontlines of competition seeing as how influential some Greeks are poised to become in the Trump Administration. 
If one looks at it from a structural standpoint, it¡¯s clear to see that the ¡®Coastal Balkans¡¯ would predictably come under the US¡¯ influence, while Russia only stands to gain footing in the ¡®Balkan Bubble¡¯ of the Central Balkans, though importantly the most pivotal part of the region through which it and China¡¯s megaprojects will pass. Balkan Stream could enter the Republic of Macedonia and thenceforth Serbia from Greece, which in this case would still give the US some degree of leverage over the project, but only up until the Greek-Macedonian border. Moreover, the Greek government has shown that it isn¡¯t too loyal to anyone and just goes wherever the money is, so even with pro-Greek lobbyists in the Trump Administration, there¡¯s no guarantee that Athens will agree to ¡®cut its nose to spite its face¡¯ in interfering with the Russian pipeline just for the sake of satisfying a few members of its American-based diaspora. Money talks, and Balkan Stream will be very profitable for the economically challenged country, so it probably won¡¯t disrupt the project and sacrifice the billions of dollars of transit fees that it stands to gain from it. Macedonia In The Middle: 
The Macedonian government, unlike its Greek counterpart, has consistently proven itself to be a reliable partner and does not have a history of waffling between foreign patrons for the sake of pecuniary interests. Whether it¡¯s in building strong relations with its existing Western partners or exploring deeper avenues of cooperation with its newer Russian and Chinese ones, nothing negative is really expected to change no matter whose sphere of influence Macedonia ultimately falls under. However, due to the tumultuous regime change attempts of the past couple of years which were sponsored and engineered by the US and a few other Western countries, there¡¯s a reasonable chance that Macedonia might responsibly ¡®hedge its bets¡¯ by moving closer to the East in response, especially when bearing in mind that the West has constantly rejected its EU and NATO applications by strongly siding with Greece in the unresolved naming dispute. In fact, by virtue of Macedonia not being in either of these two organizations, it would automatically be more likely to enter into the Russian/multipolar sphere of influence if Trump is able to clinch a related agreement with Putin. Serbia And Republika Srpska: 
As for Serbia, the country¡¯s people are overwhelmingly favorable towards Russia in spite of the Vucic government¡¯s innate pro-Western orientation and clumsy fa?ade of ¡°geopolitical balancing¡±. Nevertheless, once more the ¡°Balkan Bubble¡± of non-EU and non-NATO states comes into relevance and thus plays to Russia¡¯s favor, increasing the probability that this country will also be ¡°safely allowed¡± by the US to embrace Moscow just a little bit more substantially than it is now. That being said, Vucic isn¡¯t a trustworthy or reliable partner , so instead of taking advantage of this just like how Macedonia and Republika Srpska will expectedly do by enhancing full-spectrum relations with Russia, the Serbian leader might just blow the opportunity by stubbornly sticking to his ¡°geopolitical balancing¡± ruse in making symbolic gestures towards Russia while still deepening his country¡¯s substantial partnerships with the West. In this sense, Republika Srpska¡¯s President Dodik could be a better representation of the Serbian people¡¯s will than the Prime Minister of Serbia proper is, since this subnational leader is more likely to take advantage of being part of any future Russian sphere of influence that Vucic is. Popping The ¡®Balkan Bubble¡¯ 
For as much of a win-win agreement as the enumerated spheres of interest proposal could be, there¡¯s a lot that could go wrong in popping Russia¡¯s ¡®Balkan Bubble¡¯, not least of which is the fact that it might not even happen at all if Trump isn¡¯t able to replace and/or co-opt some of the neoconservatives embedded in the American ¡°deep state¡±. Assuming that he¡¯s able to do so to a workable extent whereby he¡¯s empowered to carry through on his projected spheres of influence plan, then there¡¯s always the chance that the US might just backstab Russia by activating the same geostrategic ticking time bombs that have threatened the Balkans for the past couple of years, such as a resumption of civil hostilities in Bosnia and a return to Albanian terrorism against Serbia and Macedonia. 
Worse still, Trump might not even know about these or be able to fully stop them if they¡¯re orchestrated by rogue neoconservative elements which were ¡®cleansed¡¯/¡¯purged¡¯ from the ¡°deep state¡± and have ordered their loyal international contacts to take revenge by sabotaging the Trump-Putin ¡®gentleman¡¯s agreement¡¯ over spheres of influence in Europe. Soros and his sympathizers could also do something similar, especially since the billionaire will probably fall out of favor with the US government during Trump¡¯s term and might be motivated to partake in similar geopolitical vengefulness. Of course, Trump might also just be bluffing with Putin and trying to reach an agreement in order to buy time before preparing a ¡®final strike¡¯ against the last vestiges of multipolarity in the continent, but that doesn¡¯t seem too probable since he¡¯s more of a level-headed and stable businessman than a risky ¡°deep state¡± gambler like Obama is. Concluding Thoughts 
Trump has a track record of reaching deals and keeping his word, and given the positive chemistry that he¡¯s already displayed towards Putin following their first-ever phone conversation with one another, observers can expect that the President-elect would probably stay true to any future promises that he makes to his Russian counterpart and consequently abide by any ¡®gentleman¡¯s agreement¡¯ that he reaches over establishing a stable sphere of influence between them in ushering in a period of New Cold War D¨¦tente. While the proposed delineation might suggest that Russia doesn¡¯t have anything to gain from the ¡®Balkan Bubble¡¯, such a conclusion would be both na?ve and premature, since Moscow does in fact have a lot of geostrategic interests in the Central Balkans which it wants to use as the basis for building full-spectrum and robust partnerships with its members. 
Should the predicted period of D¨¦tente last, then there¡¯s nothing standing in the way of Russia or any of its forecasted partners reaching these sorts of mutually beneficial partnerships since the US would be disinclined to object to them so long as it keeps its word in respecting the Trump-Putin deal. This can¡¯t be fully guaranteed no matter how convincingly it appears that it would last, but it would at the very least provide a valuable window of opportunity for both sides to intensify their relations. What¡¯s ultimately most important is that Trump takes the US¡¯ eyes off of the Balkans and stops trying to destabilize them like Obama did, since this could buy enough time for China¡¯s Balkan Silk Road high-speed rail project to be constructed and thus open up an invigorating multipolar economic corridor between the Central European capital of Budapest and the Mediterranean port of Piraeus by means of the ¡®Balkan Bubble¡¯ states of Serbia and the Republic of Macedonia. 
Russia should by that time have made itself comfortable in the ¡®Balkan Bubble¡¯ and could thus diversify its existing infrastructural and energy investments by expanding them into more of the real-sector economy, building off of the advantages that the Balkan Silk Road will provide in dramatically facilitating the logistical ease of conducting commercial business in the region. It might be optimistic to hope for so early at this point and two months before Trump even formally enters into power, but there¡¯s a very real chance that the consummate outsider will indeed shake up the neoconservative-led and Soros-influenced US foreign policy establishment and carry through on his promises to normalize relations with Russia and repair some of the global destabilization wrought by the Obama years. 
This in turn could only work out to the Balkans¡¯ benefit, especially if the man who wrote ¡°The Art Of The Deal¡± practices what he preached and reaches a monumental one with Putin to decide upon a stable sphere of influence in the region, though there¡¯s still a lot that can go wrong to prevent this from happening or sabotage it if it proves to be ¡°too successful¡±.

? Le Marais ? c¡¯est le nouveau nom de la secte globaliste, des adeptes de la soci¨¦t¨¦ ouverte, des pervers LGBT, de l'arm¨¦e de Soros, des post-humanistes et ainsi de suite. Il est absolument imp¨¦ratif de dess¨¦cher le Marais non seulement pour les ¨¦tats-Unis: c¡¯est un d¨¦fi global pour nous tous. A nos jours, chaque peuple est prisonnier de son propre Marais. Nous, tous ensemble, devons commencer la lutte contre le Marais russe, le Marais fran?ais, le Marais allemand etc. Nous avons besoin de purger nos soci¨¦t¨¦s de l'influence du Marais. Au lieu de nous battre entre nous, dess¨¦chons-le ensemble. Ass¨¦cheurs de Marais du monde entier, unissez-vous ! 
L'autre point c¡¯est que l'anti-am¨¦ricanisme est fini. Non pas parce que c'¨¦tait faux, mais exactement le contraire : parce que le peuple am¨¦ricain lui-m¨ºme a commenc¨¦ la r¨¦volution justement contre ce c?t¨¦ des ¨¦tats-Unis que nous avons tous ha?. Maintenant l'¨¦lite dirigeante europ¨¦enne, ainsi qu'une partie de l'¨¦lite russe (qui est encore lib¨¦rale), ne peuvent pas ¨ºtre blam¨¦es comme avant pour ¨ºtre trop pro-am¨¦ricaines. Ils doivent d¨¦sormais ¨ºtre blam¨¦es pour ¨ºtre ce qu'ils sont : une bande corrompue, pervertie, avare de banksters et destructeurs des cultures, des traditions et des identit¨¦s. Alors, laissez-nous ¨¦goutter le Marais europ¨¦en. Assez avec Hollande, Merkel et Bruxelles ! L¡¯Europe pour les europ¨¦ens. Soros et sa secte doivent ¨ºtre publiquement condamn¨¦s ! 
Dor¨¦navant, le Marais est un ph¨¦nom¨¨ne extraterritorial, exactement comme un r¨¦seau terroriste international. Le Marais est partout et nulle part. Hier, le centre du Marais, son noyau, ¨¦tait situ¨¦ aux ¨¦tats-Unis, mais plus maintenant. C'est une chance pour nous tous de commencer ¨¤ les chasser. Le Marais ne se manifeste plus sous une forme fix¨¦e au niveau r¨¦gional. N¨¦anmoins, il existe et a toujours une puissance extr¨ºmement grande. Mais son caract¨¨re antinational est maintenant explicitement ¨¦vident. Le Marais ne peut plus se cacher derri¨¨re l'Am¨¦rique. Il est parti en exil. Mais o¨´ ? Au Canada ? En Europe ? En Ukraine ? Pour d'autres plan¨¨tes o¨´ divers acteurs et actrices dop¨¦s promettaient d'¨¦migrer dans le cas de la victoire de Trump ? Maintenant, il est temps pour eux de tenir leur promesse. Tout cela semble ¨ºtre l'ascension des globalistes. Ils sont maintenant absorb¨¦s dans un non-lieu, une utopie, dans la terre de l'utopie lib¨¦rale - un ? no man's land ?. Nous sommes maintenant t¨¦moins de la d¨¦territorialisation du Marais, de l'¨¦lite mondialiste et du gouvernement mondial. 
Quelle est la structure du Marais ? 
Premi¨¨rement, le Marais est une id¨¦ologie - le lib¨¦ralisme. Nous avons besoin d'un proc¨¨s de Nuremberg pour le lib¨¦ralisme, la derni¨¨re id¨¦ologie politique totalitaire de la Modernit¨¦. Fermons cette page d'histoire. 
Deuxi¨¨mement, le Marais est une culture sp¨¦ciale postmoderniste. Elle est bas¨¦e sur la d¨¦composition de toute entit¨¦ par digitalisation, schizomorphisme obligatoire, et ainsi de suite. Le drainer signifie de r¨¦tablir l'unit¨¦ de l'art apollinien. L'art doit revenir au holisme. 
Troisi¨¨mement, c¡¯est le capitalisme mondial transnational. Ceci est le moteur mat¨¦riel du Marais. C¡¯est des emprunts et la R¨¦serve f¨¦d¨¦rale qui imprime des billets verts virulents. Nous devons mettre fin ¨¤ tout cela et revenir au secteur productif r¨¦el et ¨¤ l¡¯approche mercantiliste. 
Je propose de red¨¦couvrir les id¨¦es de Pitirim Sorokin. Il a not¨¦ que la dynamique sociale de l'histoire est une cha?ne de paradigmes sociaux qu'il appelait id¨¦ationnelle, id¨¦aliste, et sensualiste. L'id¨¦ation est la domination absolue de l'esprit sur la mati¨¨re, l'asc¨¦tisme et la soumission vigoureuse du monde mat¨¦riel ¨¤ l'aspiration spirituelle et religieuse. Le type id¨¦aliste est ¨¦quilibr¨¦ et fond¨¦ sur la coexistence harmonieuse de l'esprit et de la mati¨¨re, o¨´ la partie spirituelle est l¨¦g¨¨rement dominante, mais non exclusive (comme dans le type id¨¦ationnel). Le type sensualiste de la soci¨¦t¨¦ est la domination de la mati¨¨re sur l'esprit, le corps sur l'ame. Le Marais est le type sensualiste de la soci¨¦t¨¦. Jusqu'¨¤ r¨¦cemment, il semblait que ? sensualiste ? et ? am¨¦ricain ? ¨¦taient synonymes. Mais apr¨¨s le triomphe de Trump, tout est diff¨¦rent. Maintenant sensualiste signifie global et excentrique. Il y a une sorte de ""translatio imperii"" nulle part et partout. 
Sorokin a soulign¨¦ que la nature cyclique de la soci¨¦t¨¦ suit l¡¯unique cha?ne de succession : de l'id¨¦ationnel ¨¤ l'id¨¦aliste, puis sensualiste. L'id¨¦aliste ne peut pas succ¨¦der au sensualiste, comme il est impossible pour le Marais de se retransformer en semi-Marais. Apr¨¨s le Marais vient le Soleil, c'est-¨¤-dire le Feu, l'Esprit - l'Esprit dans sa forme radicale et id¨¦ationnelle. Pour dess¨¦cher le Marais, nous avons besoin du Feu Solaire, un Grand Feu qui devrait ¨ºtre en abondance. 
Le Marais et le Feu sont deux ¨¦l¨¦ments oppos¨¦s r¨¦partis ¨¤ travers la terre. La g¨¦opolitique devient alors verticale. Les deux peuvent ¨ºtre trouv¨¦s ¨¤ tout endroit. Le sens du lieu maintenant est l'¨¦lan du processus de drainage du Marais. O¨´ ? Ici et maintenant. 
Le Marais n'est plus l'h¨¦g¨¦monie am¨¦ricaine car le Pr¨¦sident de l'Am¨¦rique lui-m¨ºme rejette une telle h¨¦g¨¦monie. C'est donc l'h¨¦g¨¦monie ? tout court ?, l'h¨¦g¨¦monie comme telle avec un vide purement postmoderniste au centre. 
Les Etats-Unis sont l'Extr¨ºme Occident du monde. C'est l'espace de Minuit. Et l¨¤, le dernier point de la Chute est atteint. Le moment qui se d¨¦roule est celui du changement de p?les. L'Occident se transforme en Orient. Poutine et Trump sont dans les deux coins oppos¨¦s de la plan¨¨te. Au XX¨¨me si¨¨cle, ces deux extr¨ºmes ¨¦taient incarn¨¦s par les formes les plus radicales de la Modernit¨¦ - le capitalisme et le communisme - deux monstres apocalyptiques - le L¨¦viathan et l¡¯Hippopotame. Maintenant, ils se sont transform¨¦s en deux promesses eschatologiques : la Grande Russie de Poutine et l'Am¨¦rique qui se lib¨¦re sous Trump. Le XXI¨¨me si¨¨cle a enfin commenc¨¦. 
Donc tout ce dont nous avons besoin maintenant, c'est le Feu.

Hi everybody. As you may know, I¡¯m an American who was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, although I made a life decision four years ago to permanently leave the US and move to the Russian Federation. If you¡¯re interested in my specific background and what motivated me to take that step, I suggest that you check out the interview that I gave to Serbian-American journalist Stephen Karganovic about this last spring when I visited him in Belgrade. 
I¡¯m addressing you all directly in a form which I never use in my articles, and that¡¯s the first-person. I know that so many of you guys are confused and struggling to understand why Trump won, and I totally understand what you¡¯re feeling because it¡¯s very difficult for any foreigner to truly comprehend what just happened in the US. The best way for me to convey this to you all is to talk on a personal level in the hopes that my delivery will get through to you. I¡¯m not expecting anyone to agree with the points that I make, but just to understand what motivated Trump supporters to get out to the polls and shake up The Establishment. 
Although I don¡¯t live in the US anymore, I was born and raised in one of the most quintessential representations of what constitutes modern-day ¡°average America¡±, and that¡¯s Cleveland, Ohio. Despite being nearly halfway across the world, I never lost touch with where I came from and will always remember the formative experiences which shaped my worldview. I still stay in contact with my American family and several close friends so I remain up to date on what¡¯s going on ¡°back home¡±, and as they say, ¡°you can take someone out of their homeland, but you can¡¯t take the homeland out of the person¡±. 
For better or for worse, I¡¯ll always embody certain ¡°American¡± characteristics forged from my upbringing in Cleveland, and given that these idiosyncrasies are now representative of the prevailing political zeitgeist in the US as evidenced by Trump¡¯s Triumph, I want to share some of them with you all in the hopes that everyone can get a better grasp on the fundamental changes that are taking place in the US today. A man who I call ¡°Uncle Vinny¡± once inspiringly advised me when I was younger that ¡°the difference between genius and crazy is in getting others to understand you¡±, so with that wisdom in mind, here¡¯s the best that I can do in trying to help all my foreign friends understand the mentality of the typical Trump supporter. 
So many toxic individuals said that I and tens of millions of other people were ¡°racists¡±, ¡°fascists¡±, and ¡°white supremacists¡± just because we¡¯ve been publicly sharing our observations over the past year and a half that Trump¡¯s rhetoric and platform represent the desires of many Americans, but we held our ground and doubled down because we knew that we were right and that the American People would ultimately choose Donald J. Trump to be the next President of the United States. 
This is why ¡°outsiders¡± such as myself and everyone else who rallied behind Trump are so valuable to the larger conversations taking place because we consistently break through the narrow-minded groupthink of The Establishment and express what¡¯s really going on, ¡°political correctness¡± be damned. No foreigner can ever fully understand what happened yesterday, not even if they lived in the US for years unless they experienced what the middle class (not the academic-governmental-business class) experienced for their entire lives. 
Michael Moore, who¡¯s also a native of the ¡°Rust Belt¡± like myself and understands the mentality of the millions of Americans who revolted against The Establishment and historically broke through Hillary¡¯s Midwest ¡°firewall¡±, conveyed the reason why voters in this dilapidated and socio-economically ¡°backward/forgotten¡± corner of the US would flock towards Trump in an address which was ironically supposed to be against the future President-elect. Trump supporters, however, decided to turn the most relevant and motivational part of Moore¡¯s speech into a YouTube video filled with dramatic images and music, and I strongly suggest that everyone take five minutes out of their day to listen to what he had to say. 
When you live a life surrounded by drugs, poverty, crime, potholes, and hopelessness, the only thing that you feel that you have going for you are the sexual, alcoholic, and musical distractions that The Establishment shoves down everyone¡¯s throat each and every day in order to placate the masses by ¡°making it all better¡± just for a little bit of (¡°fun¡±) time. Turn off the TV or go to sleep after the party, and the same problems that people sought to escape from are still there the very next morning and not a damned thing has tangibly changed for the better, except that some people have now found a socially acceptable ¡°go-to medicine¡± for dealing with the repulsive reality that they feel they have to put up with each and every day for the rest of their lives. 
A lot of Americans where I¡¯m from don¡¯t know what a ¡°real vacation¡± is, in that they don¡¯t go globetrotting around the world like the Europeans do on what they call their ¡°holidays¡±. Many Midwesterners even have a hard time going from one part of the country to another just for fun because it¡¯s a huge financial burden for the average Clevelander in our cheap and low-wage economy to gather up the funds necessary to jet set out to costly California just to take in some sunshine, for example. Another thing that most foreigners don¡¯t realize is that people from my part of the country don¡¯t even have the vacation/holiday days like the rest of the world does. If you¡¯re working a low-wage service-sector job or are in a low-level office position, then you might never receive two back-to-back weeks of vacation in your life. If you get married, the best that you can dream for is a honeymoon to Niagara Falls for a week and that¡¯s it, just because it¡¯s conveniently nearby and not overly expensive. 
We grew up our whole lives hearing from The Establishment and its media shills how ¡°great¡± and ¡°powerful¡± the US is, how it¡¯s the ¡°best country in the history of the world¡±, yet all that we see around us is socio-economic devastation and we can¡¯t imagine how it could ever be any different. So many factories have closed up shop and moved to Mexico, China, and countries that the average American in my part of the US never heard of or can even pronounce, and it¡¯s all because of the post-Cold War globalization that started under Bill Clinton and NAFTA. But at the same time, however, we see that there are indeed some people around us who seem to be living a pretty good life but haven¡¯t had to do much to achieve it. 

You foreigners might be shocked to hear this, but a lot of Clevelanders can¡¯t believe that ¡°refugees¡±, some minorities, and illegal immigrants are able to live ¡®high off the hog¡¯ as we say just because of the huge amounts of tax-payer-provided government assistance that they receive for not really doing a lot of anything other than being the ¡°politically correct¡± category of people that they are. I don¡¯t expect people outside of the US to understand this, and even many Americans who don¡¯t live in the ¡°Rust Belt¡± (and even some who do) will probably find this to be inconceivable, but so many of these types of folks who I just mentioned ¨C and including a lot of whites, too ¨C abuse the ¡°benefits¡± system just so that they can get the most amount of free stuff as they can for the absolute least amount of work and effort. 
In the ¡°politically correct¡± dystopian society that the ¡°liberal-progressives¡± and Cultural Marxists of the Democratic Party have strove to create for decades, the state will house, feed, and pay people just because of their race and class, and while this might have been ¡°originally intended¡± to temporarily help those who fell on hard times and couldn¡¯t properly help themselves, it has been abused by so many people and turned into a slush fund for paying off loyal leftists who willingly choose to remain indefinitely dependent on The Establishment. These people have made a conscious choice to ¡°settle for less¡± than they could ever hope to achieve if they worked hard and stayed focused because ¡°The American Dream¡± is out of reach for many of them in this part of the country and they figured out how easy it is to scheme the system and have other Americans subsidize the less-than-ideal lifestyles that they¡¯ve settled for. 
Remember, I¡¯m not asking you guys to agree with any of what I¡¯ve written, but I¡¯m just telling you as a ¡°voice from the inside¡± about why so many people in Ohio and the ¡°Rust Belt¡± support Trump and are drawn to his promises to smash The Establishment that they¡¯ve spent their whole lives seeing steal from them, neglect them, and unjustly help others who pledge their loyalty to the existing state of affairs. Don¡¯t forget that it was people who think the way that I just described who decisively changed the course of American history on Election Day, and they take pride in being ¡°politically incorrect¡± and rebelling against the system that they feel has held them down their entire lives. Be it through the abovementioned examples of unfairness and injustice, or through the incessant attempts to dismantle their identity by suppressing and trashing their religious liberties and traditions, people in the ¡°Rust Belt¡± have had enough. 
See, that¡¯s the thing that foreigners don¡¯t realize, and it¡¯s that Americans in this part of the country feel that they¡¯re living under the boot of a tyrannical and totalitarian ideology which censors their dissent with ¡°racist¡±, ¡°fascist¡±, and ¡°white supremacist¡± reputation-killing accusations and works 24/7/365 to brainwash them into thinking that they ¨C and not the system ¨C are the problem. Imagine George Orwell¡¯s 1984 and you¡¯ll have an idea about how a lot people view the ideology of ¡°political correctness¡±. It is so pervasive, so controlling, that those who are suffering under it were bound to eventually revolt once the time was ripe. All of these anti-¡°political correctness¡± dissidents thought that they were alone and were the ¡°crazy outlier¡± amongst their brainwashed compatriots, but then Donald Trump came along and gave them all the signal that this was the historic moment that they had been waiting their entire lives for to finally rebel against this totalitarian ideology. If there was no ¡°political correctness¡±, then there would never have risen a Donald Trump to save the hard-working blue collar folks of the USA. 
The majority-blue collar inhabitants of the ¡°Rust Belt¡± have been voiceless for decades and were seething with rage this whole time. They couldn¡¯t speak out against the majority-black crime that ravages their neighborhoods because otherwise they¡¯d be tarred and feathered as ¡°racists¡±. They couldn¡¯t condemn globalization and the outsourcing of their livelihoods to Mexico, China, and other countries or else they¡¯d be mercilessly attacked as ¡°fascists¡±. God forbid these people ever spoke publicly about building a wall with Mexico to stop the tens of millions of illegal immigrants and uncountable tons of deadly narcotics that have flooded the US since NAFTA, since then they¡¯d be called the ultimate insult and accused of being ¡°white supremacists¡±. These people thought that they were largely alone with their feelings because the system did such an effective job of self-censoring them and thus separating them from the silent majority of likeminded Americans, but then Donald Trump emerged on the scene and millions of people were finally united via his rallies and social-alternative medias to finally muster up the courage to collectively resist The Establishment and its allied social-pop culture-academic-political elite¡¯s intimidation. 
When Election Day came, these dispossessed Americans didn¡¯t back down and buy into The Establishment¡¯s propaganda that Hillary was going to trounce Trump with an historic landslide but instead went to vote anyhow, knowing that this was the only hope left for them to ever possibly change their inescapably dismal life situations. 
The most intense psychological warfare operation ever conducted against Americans was a complete failure. The Establishment¡¯s War on the People sought to convince them that Trump didn¡¯t stand a chance to win and that voting for him just showed how ¡°racist¡±, ¡°fascist¡±, and ¡°white supremacist¡± you were. ¡°Political correctness¡±, globalization, and the unfettered illegal immigration and unvetted ¡°refugee¡± resettlement of millions of people who staunchly refuse to assimilate and integrate into American Society or even speak English is just a fact of life that these ¡°deplorable¡± citizens will be forced to put up and deal with until they die (or are killed by some of the ¡°new arrivals¡± who flocked into their hometowns). But The Establishment and its social-pop culture-academic-political shills were wrong and Trump supporters knew it because they had finally connected with one another and were convinced that they truly embodied the silent majority, and the frustration, hopelessness, and pain that comes every single day living in a ¡°politically correct¡± system is what sent millions of Americans into a rage against the system which was so widespread that it became impossible for Hillary to steal the election. 
The War on the People was waged by Americans, on Americans, and against everything that the silent majority believes that America stands for, which is why it was totally unprecedented in American history. Not even the divide-and-rule Color Revolution tactics that The Establishment dangerously and irresponsibly relied on with the help of George Soros and his ¡°Black Lives Matter¡± urban extremists could succeed in intimidating the Trump Movement and compelling them to stop, which testifies to the deep conviction that Trump supporters have in their beliefs and the hope that they have that their candidate of choice will finally free them from the misery that has come to define their lives. 
Dear foreign friends, forget everything that you may have ever thought about the US system, national ideology, and the American People ¨C from here on out, you and 99% of all other non-American observers begin at Day 1 in working to understand the inner nuances of Trump Country and Trump¡¯s America. My state of Ohio had the highest honor of being the biggest upset to Hillary Clinton by 9%, something which has shocked The Establishment. We, the people of Ohio, are the heart of Trumpland. He didn¡¯t win by a few percentage points like in every other swing state, but by almost double digits. This should be more than enough proof that everything that I, as a born-and-raised Clevelander, am revealing to you about how and why Trump won the ¡°Rust Belt¡± and broke through Hillary¡¯s firewall. Where I¡¯m from, people don¡¯t just have 1 or 2 Trump signs in their yard ¨C they have 5, 10, or 20 of them, especially if they live in the farmland right outside of the city. 
I¡¯m not expecting you to understand everything that I wrote, let alone to agree with it, but I felt obligated to do the best that I can to inform you all about why Trump won and the reasons behind the ¡°Rust Belt¡± revolt against The Establishment which handed him the Presidency. For all of what you might think are their personal and ideological faults, Trump supporters feel validated by this election because it proved that the system and all of its shills were lying about Hillary¡¯s ¡°imminent landslide¡± this entire time. What had been derided for over a year and a half as the ¡°conspiratorial thinking¡± of a ¡°vast right-wing conspiracy¡± (one with phantasmal and invented links to the Russian secret services) was exposed as a fact ¨C The Establishment was indeed lying this entire time and desperately waged what amounts to the most intense psychological operation against Americans ever conducted in history, and that¡¯s the War on the People. Nobody can deny it any longer, the facts are the facts and all the ¡°official¡± ¡°thinkers¡±, pundits, and ¡°experts¡± were wrong because they either deliberately refused to recognize the reality that was before their eyes or were complicit in siding with the system out of the self-interested expectation that they¡¯ll somehow end up benefiting from its perpetuation. 
Tough times are ahead, and the nation is more divided and polarized than ever before, though this is largely due to the lingering psychological effects of The Establishment¡¯s War on the People than anything else. The Second American Revolution was indeed a victory of the American People over The Establishment, but it¡¯s now under threat from the Clintonian Counter-Revolution that¡¯s broken out in the streets of many pro-Democrat American cities. It¡¯s the height of irony that the people who just a few days ago criticized Trump for not pledging to blindly respect the results of the vote are now the ones who don¡¯t recognize its outcome and are poised to tear America¡¯s inner cities apart just because they couldn¡¯t pull off stealing the election of our lifetime. 
I don¡¯t think anybody knows how far the rioters will be directed/misled by their Hillary-Soros-neoconservative handlers to go, nor how President-elect Trump will respond to their unrest once he takes office in mid-January, but what I can in fact tell each and every one of you without an inkling of doubt in my mind is that the Trump supporters of the Midwestern ¡°Rust Belt¡± who helped hand him his victory in the first place will form the vanguard Second Amendment-wielding citizens leading the Reverse-Color Revolution movement to legally safeguard the 45th President¡¯s constitutional legitimacy if things disastrously get out of control.

In the aftermath of what is being called the ¡°greatest upset in political history,¡± Donald Trump has been elected the next president of the United States and this has markets in shock across the globe. What Trump Promised In His Speech Is Extremely Important In Trump¡¯s speech he discussed ¡°rebuilding America¡¯s infrastructure¡± and making it ¡°second to none.¡± The reason this is so important is because Trump has essentially confirmed the recent proposal for the Fed to print trillions of dollars, which will then be given to the U.S. Treasury to spend on rebuilding America¡¯s crumbling infrastructure. This will not only juice the American economy and create a great many jobs, but it will also be extremely bullish for the gold market over the long-term¡­ A GREAT OPPORTUNITY: To find out which company is set to become one of the highest grade producing gold mines on the planet and is one of the greatest precious metals investment opportunities in the world CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored At one point the price of gold surged over $60 as it became clear that Donal Trump would be the next president of the United States. Although it has now pulled back and the dollar has bounced a bit, this has clearly not been a good result for the gold bears, who were heavily short the metal before the election results were announced. Silver also surged nearly 70 cents, breaking above $19 before pulling back. With regards to the trillions of dollars that will be injected into the U.S. economy, former Soros associate Victor Sperandeo, who oversees more than $3 billion, told KWN: ¡°Eric, this is pure printing of money, but the theory is that because people don¡¯t directly get that money, it won¡¯t create hyperinflation. But when this begins, this will be the beginning of when serious inflation will come back. If this does happen you will get a huge amount of government spending that is going to juice the economy. But it will be the prelude to hyperinflation. So that is going to be the coming world event that will be the beginning of the end for the U.S. dollar.¡± Sperandeo then issued this bone-chilling warning: And as the hyperinflation unfolds, it will send the world into total chaos and people need to be prepared for that.¡± One thing is clear, a Donald Trump America will look very different than what the U.S. has looked like for the past 8 years. The question is, how much of a difference can a president make with the United States¡¯ fiscal state in such a desperate situation? Regardless, like Brexit, this was definitely not what the elite had planned and it really was the greatest upsets in political history.

Today former U.S. Treasury Secretary just warned that Trump could be assassinated. 
(King World News) Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Dr. Paul Craig Roberts: The US presidential election is historic, because the American people were able to defeat the oligarchs. Hillary Clinton, an agent for the Oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that the media and the political establishments of the political parties no longer have credibility with the American people¡­ SPEAKING OF GOLD¡­ To find out which company is set to become one of the highest grade producing gold mines on the planet and is one of the greatest precious metals investment opportunities in the world CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored 
Dr. Paul Craig Roberts continues: It remains to be seen whether Trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore American jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with Russia, China, Syria, and Iran. 
Will The Elite Make A Move Against Trump? It also remains to be seen how the Oligarchy will respond to Trump¡¯s victory. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve can cause an economic crisis in order to put Trump on the defensive, and they can use the crisis to force Trump to appoint one of their own as Secretary of the Treasury. Rogue agents in the CIA and Pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt friendly relations with Russia. Trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government. 
With Trump there is at least hope. Unless Trump is obstructed by bad judgment in his appointments and by obstacles put in his way, we should expect an end to Washington¡¯s orchestrated conflict with Russia, the removal of the US missiles on Russia¡¯s border with Poland and Romania, the end of the conflict in Ukraine, and the end of Washington¡¯s effort to overthrow the Syrian government. However, achievements such as these imply the defeat of the US Oligarchy. Although Trump defeated Hillary, the Oligarchy still exists and is still powerful. 
Trump said that he no longer sees the point of NATO 25 years after the Soviet collapse. If he sticks to his view, it means a big political change in Washington¡¯s EU vassals. The hostility toward Russia of the current EU and NATO officials would have to cease. German Chancellor Merkel would have to change her spots or be replaced. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg would have to be dismissed. 
We do not know who Trump will select to serve in his government. It is likely that Trump is unfamiliar with the various possibilities and their positions on issues. It really depends on who is advising Trump and what advice they give him. Once we see his government, we will know whether we can be hopeful for the changes that now have a chance. 
Trump Could Be Assassinated If the oligarchy is unable to control Trump and he is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military/security complex and in holding the financial sector politically accountable, Trump could be assassinated. 
Trump said that he will put Hillary in prison. He should first put her on trial for treason and war crimes along with all of the neoconservatives. That would clear the decks for peace with the other two major nuclear powers over whom the neoconservatives seek hegemony. Although the neoconservatives would still have contacts in the hidden deep state, it would make it difficult for the vermin to organize false flag operations or an assassination. Rogue elements in the military/security complex could still bring off an assassination, but without neocons in the government a coverup would be more difficult. 
Trump has more understanding and insight than his opponents realize. For a man such as Trump to risk acquiring so many powerful enemies and to risk his wealth and reputation, he had to have known that the people¡¯s dissatisfaction with the ruling establishment meant he could be elected president. 
We won¡¯t know what to expect until we see who are the Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries. If it is the usual crowd, we will know Trump has been captured. 
The Discredited Mainstream Media A happy lasting result of the election is the complete discrediting of the US media. The media predicted an easy Hillary victory and even Democratic Party control of the US Senate. Even more important to the media¡¯s loss of influence and credibility, despite the vicious media attack on Trump throughout the presidential primaries and presidential campaign, the media had no effect outside the Northeast and West coasts, the stomping grounds of the One Percent. The rest of the country ignored the media. 
I did not think the Oligarchy would allow Trump to win. However, it seems that the oligarchs were deceived by their own media propaganda. Assured that Hillary was the sure winner, they were unprepared to put into effect plans to steal the election. 
Hillary is down, but not the Oligarchs. If Trump is advised to be conciliatory, to hold out his hand, and to take the establishment into his government, the American people will again be disappointed. In a country whose institutions have been so completely corrupted by the Oligarchy, it is difficult to achieve real change without bloodshed. ***ALSO JUST RELEASED: After Trump Shocker, One Market Is In Freefall!

As the bond market continues to melt down, interest rates rise and the Dollar Index surges above 100, legend Art Cashin gave one of his most important interviews ever to King World News about a Trump presidency, the New World Order, gold, Brexit, the Great Depression, and why we will see panic before the end of the year. 
Eric King: ¡°In Trump¡¯s acceptance speech he said that we are going to have massive infrastructure spending. Is that bearish for gold? I don¡¯t think so.¡± 
Gold Market Hit As Druckenmiller Sells Art Cashin: ¡°No. That on the face of it would not be a reason to sell gold. One of the things that may have concerned Druckenmiller was not so much your scenario of fiscal spending and building roads and highways, but the fact that despite what the Fed has been doing, the money supply has not been showing any velocity. That¡¯s a topic you and I have discussed time and time again and it¡¯s one of the holdups to gold because if it gets no velocity that¡¯s deflationary. 
In fact, the largest growth in money stock is in cash ¡ª green pictures of dead presidents ¡ª and that is deflationary because that does not have a lending factor that money in a bank would have. So those are two deflationary trends in money and that tends to weigh a little bit on gold and doesn¡¯t allow it to fulfill its promise that you would expect in a somewhat inflationary period.¡± 
Eric King: ¡°Victor Sperandeo, a former associate of George Sorors, said to me this will be ¡®pure money printing.¡¯ That we are going to print trillions of dollars and build infrastructure ¡ª talk about how you view that. Obviously there are going to be jobs created and it will be great for infrastructure, so it will juice the economy, but what are the longer-term ramifications?¡± 
Art Cashin: ¡°On the face of it, it looks good. As you said, there will be jobs created and there will be improvements in roads and airports and so on. However, the other shoe to fall is that Mr. Trump is also committed to revamping the tax code. And those two things should lead to a massive increase in the deficit. And we are already deeply in debt, so people like Rosenberg and others feel like it will have virtually no impact. 
On the face of it the stimulus program should be great for the economy, but because you are in such a high level of debt it might not work out that way. He and others point out that if fiscal stimulus were the answer then Japan would be the king of the world with all of those bridges to nowhere that they built. Japan spent a lot of money, built up their deficit, and their economy never really turned around.¡± 
Eric King: ¡°Going back even further than that and looking at the Great Depression, the United States was struggling and then FDR devalued the dollar by revaluing the price of gold higher. Those public works projects then got underway, the massive public works projects that built so much of the infrastructure here in the United States, Art. And that did turn the stock market around. It turned many things around ¡ª commodities, etc ¡ª but then it rolled over by 1937-1938 and then the war came. Is this infrastructure spending program something that can look good for a little while and then it will just roll over like we saw in 1937-1938?¡± 
Art Cashin: ¡°It can. And the problem (during the Great Depression) was that the thing didn¡¯t click, as it were. It didn¡¯t lead to the next step. You hire people, you do the road projects, you do whatever, and then you want to see them go out and spend and business begin to borrow and banks to lend. And in ¡¯37 and ¡¯38 that never fully kicked in. U.S. Experiences Second Stock Market Collapse From 1937 To 1938 
You had high government officials, in frustration, go to Congress and testify: ¡°We couldn¡¯t get it started. We just couldn¡¯t get it started.¡± 
For all of the deficit spending, for all of the government programs, it never fully worked. That¡¯s the fear. Again, if you go back to Japan, clearly they spent trillions of Japanese yen in massive building projects and it never kicked in, it never took over. The people continued to worry and hold onto their money. 
A Worried Public Is Hoarding Cash As I¡¯ve told you before, this whole thing about helicopter money and whatnot, if Bernanke flew over your house and dropped a million dollars in brand new money, and you were so worried that you got up and hid it in the garage until you figured out what the economy was going to do¡­And that is virtually what has happened to us for the past seven years. 
They have tried all kinds of increases in money supply but it has never kicked in and people are so terrified that they are not spending, and basically, as I said, the large amount of growth was in cash. So they are putting it in the mattress, not even in the bank.¡± 
Eric King: ¡°Art, for so many years on King World News you have been talking about this lending and spending not kicking in, and you have used that Bernanke analogy over and over again. It¡¯s not normal for you to beat up on a point as much as you have. But earlier you brought up Japan, and then when we covered the Great Depression you discussed 1937-1938, and the the testimonies before Congress from people saying, ¡®We just couldn¡¯t get it started.¡¯ Did you know all along that it was going to unfold this way to some degree with the lack of lending and spending? Did you know that from history?¡± 
Art Cashin: ¡°I had a fear of it and it became pretty evident after some of the first things they (central planners) did. It is not a very difficult game. Every week the Federal Reserve reports the Money Supply and the Federal Reserve of St. Louis reports the Monetary Stock, which is the amount of raw money that the Fed adds in. ¡°We Just Couldn¡¯t Get It Started¡± ¨C Monetary Stock Plunging 
¡°That Shouldn¡¯t Be¡± For a year now, despite all the things you have heard, despite all the programs and ¡®pump-priming¡¯ and Yellen and all the doves, the Monetary Stock has not increased all year. That shouldn¡¯t be. 60-Year Velocity Of Money Stock Hitting New Lows 
If money has velocity, then you can see the economy begin to move up. If it gets too much velocity, then you get to see inflation. But so far we are not getting a high dose of either. Although, if you ask somebody standing in the supermarket if they have inflation they might give you a bit of an argument. But by government standards it¡¯s not quite there yet.¡± 
Eric King: ¡°Along those same lines, Art, you¡¯ve warned repeatedly about Weimar Germany and the experience of the 1920s. This idea that there can be no inflation and then suddenly it just kicks in and then all hell breaks loose. You¡¯ve warned so many time about that. Is that what¡¯s in front of us?¡± 
Art Cashin: ¡°You will begin to know it. Everybody talks about the Weimar Republic where they actually printed cash money and flooded the system. It wasn¡¯t just the bank reserves ¡ª they actually flooded the system with paper money. And amazingly, amazingly, it was a while before that actually kicked in in an inflationary manner. And as you alluded to, I¡¯ve said this time and time again, it¡¯s one of those things like spontaneous combustion ¡ª it¡¯s there and it¡¯s there and it¡¯s there and suddenly it bursts into flames. And when it bursts into flames it consumes everything about it. And that¡¯s when you can have a runaway inflation. 
But so far it has not burst into flames. And that is why to even some degree the Fed is frustrated, hoping to get inflation up above 2 percent. And they may be in a position where, be careful what you wish for. Because if they get 2 percent and above it could suddenly combust and things could begin to move rather rapidly.¡± 
Eric King: ¡°Art, let me ask you this about the Trump presidency. It seems like for those people out there who, as he said, felt lost, the lost Americans, and for those out there who really felt like they were having globalism shoved down their throats in Europe and in the United States, this seemed to be a moment in time where there was going to be some backtracking. The borders were going to be closed, there would be some protectionism ¡ª we all know the plusses and minuses of that ¡ª but how did you view this Trump election and him becoming president, the idea that the elite got sand kicked in their face and that this New World Order would be slowed down, if only for a moment?¡± 
Donald Trump¡¯s Shocker And Why Brexit Is Nowhere Near Over Art Cashin: ¡°I view it as yet one more extension of what looks to be a populist revolt that is sweeping the world. You saw the beginning of it with Brexit, and you have too many pundits on TV saying, ¡®Well, that ended quickly in reverse.¡¯ Brexit is nowhere near over. But the reason that markets didn¡¯t continue to spiral (downward) is that they realized that Brexit has basically been postponed. They haven¡¯t gone in and declared Article 50. Once they start the process in motion, the consequences of Brexit are going to be there and they are going to be drastic. 
Now, if you take Trump¡¯s election as the second leg of populism, the next thing you look for is the December 4th referendum in Italy. And there¡¯s a good chance that will cause the government to fail and Italy will be right back in the middle of a major European crisis, and we¡¯ll be right back where we were with Greece (only much larger in scale). So this game is far from over and we could see further panic as we head into the end of the year.¡± 
Eric King: ¡°Ahead of what¡¯s going to happen in Italy, because I think that will unfold as you just predicted, Art, a Trump America going forward and this idea that the elites have been pushing globalism down everybody¡¯s throats with NAFTA and so many things that have happened around the world. The globalism and the push to eliminate national boundaries, we¡¯ve seen that in Europe and of course they had talked about combining Canada, the United States and Mexico into one regional unit. This idea that globalism has taken a huge blow here, is that true? Or did it just slow it down? What will a Trump presidency mean in that sense?¡± 
¡°You¡¯re Fired!¡± Art Cashin: ¡°We¡¯ve got a lot of things to see. Over the next week or two you are going to see whom he appoints to the cabinet and who holds him under their sway. It would appear, however, because of the size of his commitment, he¡¯s got to address globalization and global trade. He¡¯s got to go back and revisit even NAFTA. 
I think some of his early attempts will be reasonably good. He will do some fiscal stimulus, some building and repairing, hopefully getting the tax structure in better order. But that will not be the end of it. He can pivot a bit but he can¡¯t completely abandon it (his campaign promises). People will have to watch what he does. 
Now, he may cleverly hire some people and put burdens on their shoulders. If after six months things don¡¯t work out, he can revert to his TV personality and say, ¡®You¡¯re fired,¡¯ to show the American people that he¡¯s staying on top.

As we kick off the third week of trading in November, today James Turk spoke with King World News about why what Donald Trump faces is very different from what Ronald Reagan face, but here is the good news¡­ 
James Turk: ¡° Congratulations to Mr Trump. If his presidency is as remarkable as his election, Eric, he could go down in history as a great president. I expect that a lot of things will change because of Trump. That¡¯s what voters want¡­ Sponsored 
I¡¯ve seen polls showing that 70% or more of the electorate believes the country is headed in the wrong direction. A result like that cuts across party lines. 
The last time I felt like this about the potential for major systemic change was when Reagan became president in 1981. Coincidentally, a lot of people back then were shocked that Reagan would be president, just like the shock we are seeing today with Trump¡¯s victory. I hope that with his performance that Trump confounds his cynics just like Reagan did. 
With Reagan the coming systemic changes were pretty obvious because Paul Volcker had already been appointed as Fed chairman and had unsettled the markets by increasing interest rates. That signaled a major inflationary cycle was ending. 
The Reagan presidency began a new disinflationary cycle, which lasted until Bush No. 2 took office. Annual increases in monetary debasement once again became measurable, and the gold price began rising in response. 
I am not convinced at this time that we are at the end of any cycle, but I nevertheless expect circumstances will indeed be different going forward. My thinking is that the present cycle of monetary debasement is not going to end or even just abate as occurred with Reagan. 
The change I expect is the trend of purchasing power erosion will accelerate. Trump of course could change that trend. He is so far making the right statements. Lower taxes and less regulation will indeed improve the economy. A stronger economy will increase tax revenues, which will be needed to fund the infrastructure spending that Trump is promising. 
But so far he seems to be ignoring a key issue. The federal government¡¯s debt has become so big it is now unmanageable. To illustrate my point, let¡¯s take Trump at his word that he is going to control government spending so it doesn¡¯t increase the deficit, even though he is going to increase spending for defense and infrastructure. Let¡¯s assume that the increased spending in these two areas is covered by higher tax revenue from economic growth, and is therefore neutral to the deficit. 
But what if interest rates rise to a more normal 5% as some are predicting? 
Let¡¯s assume Mr Trump saves money by completely eliminating the Departments of Commerce, Education, Housing and Labor. Then he also eliminates the Environmental Protection Agency, and throws in some other savings by completely eliminating International Assistance Programs, NASA and the National Science Foundation. 
Add it all up and Trump saves about $200 billion each year. That¡¯s about equal to the additional annual interest expense on the $20 trillion federal government debt if rates rise 1%. So if interest rates rise to 5%, the federal deficits are going to soar. To fund those deficits, the Federal Reserve is going to have to do a lot of money printing, which of course will debase the dollar by eroding its purchasing power. 
The important point is that if the Fed hikes rates, then rising interest rates will   borrow even more just to pay interest on its debt, which creates a vicious cycle that will ultimately destroy the dollar. But if interest rates stay low, the Fed destroys savers and capitalism because it is eliminating the incentive to save any national currency, which lowers the demand for that currency and in this way too the Fed ultimately destroys the dollar. 
So in either scenario, the dollar is toast, but there is a solution¡­This will be continued tomorrow in part two of James Turk¡¯s powerful interview. In the meantime, for those who are interested in hearing more about the gold market and the Trump shocker, KWN has just released   gold,   more. and you can listen to this extraordinary interview   Legend Art Cashin On A Trump Presidency, The New World Order, Gold, Brexit, The Great Depression And Why We Will See Panic  ",english,2016-11-15T10:00:12.670+02:00,kingworldnews.com,US,53149,"James Turk ¨C What Donald Trump Faces Is Very Different From What Ronald Reagan Faced, Expect Major Market Moves¡­",0,http://kingworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/King-World-News-James-Turk-What-Donald-Trump-Faces-Is-Very-Different-Than-Ronald-Reagan-.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

After the election chaos of last week, is President Trump really going to revalue gold to this jaw-dropping price? 
Part II of James Turk¡¯s KWN interview: ¡°When I say that the dollar is toast, Eric, I am of course referring to the Federal Reserve dollar (F$), which circulates as a money substitute in place of the Constitutional dollar (C$). The C$ is 11.369 grains of gold ($42.22 per ounce)¡­ Sponsored 
President Nixon ¡°temporarily¡± ¨C to use his word ¨C suspended the conversion of F$s into C$s back in 1971. 
Trump¡¯s only option to end the clear divisions in the country is to increase prosperity with a level playing field for everyone. And the way to do that is to take away the advantages the 1%ers enjoy as a result of an unconstitutional monetary system. 
The Need To Build A Sound Monetary System So President Trump has to build a sound monetary system. To do this he must end Nixon¡¯s temporary suspension of dollar redeemability into gold. Restoring a Constitutional dollar will provide a solid the foundation for building a new monetary system. The best way to do that is to follow the precepts of the Coinage Act of 1792, which is America¡¯s first and best time-tested law concerning money. 
Back in June, when asked about the gold standard Trump replied: ¡°Bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do, but boy, would it be wonderful.¡± 
The ¡°hard¡± task he is of course referring to is making the gold standard credible after decades of monetary debasement. Rebuilding credibility will indeed be a difficult task, but can be accomplished over time. Initially all that is needed is to make sure that gold flows into the Treasury ¨C and not out from it ¨C when redemption of the dollar into gold is restored. 
Will Trump Revalue Gold To $10,000? To do that Trump will need to make the new monetary system credible by accounting for all the monetary debasement of the F$ since 1971. That means the Treasury will need to be ready to act as required under a gold standard to buy gold and redeem dollars for gold at a credible price, which I calculate to be $10,000 per ounce. 
Some may find $10,000 to be eye-watering, but this amount is based on historical experience. It would simply be repeating what happened in 1934. When President Roosevelt devalued the dollar by 41% from 23.222 grains of gold ($20.67) to 13.714 grains ($35), gold flowed into the Treasury in exchange for dollars. The resulting increase of sound money flowing into the economy enabled it to begin the process of recovering from the depths of the Great Depression. 
So to make a new gold standard credible by getting gold to flow into the Treasury, we need to repeat what FDR did. It is easy to calculate. 
After the 1934 devaluation, the weight of gold in the Treasury was 15% of the total quantity of dollars in M3. Today M3 is $17.6 trillion, and supposedly there are 261.5 million ounces of gold in Treasury vaults. Which equates to $67,304 per ounce. So 15% of that is $10,095. For simplicity, let¡¯s round it to $10,000, meaning that one C$ would be defined as 0.048 of one grain of gold. At that $10,000 rate of exchange, gold will flow into the Treasury from the far reaches of the planet, benefitting global economies as well as the US economy. 
We need to ask ourselves, won¡¯t this resulting increase in the money supply be inflationary? Answer: No more than it was during the Great Depression. In one year after FDR¡¯s devaluation, M3 increased by 10.2%, but there was little inflation. The bulk of the new money was not put into speculation, but rather, used in productive purposes that began rebuilding the US economy. 
What¡¯s more, commodities and other goods that were being hoarded as an alternative to bank deposits flowed into circulation, helping keep inflation under control. The same thing will happen today. But let¡¯s not forget, what happens to the federal government¡¯s debt mountain? I suspect some government promises will be broken ¨C like changing Social Security to reduce payouts ¨C to enable the debt to be brought back under control, which brings up one last point. 
A credible national currency and creditworthy government are different things. They do go hand-in-hand, but you need the former to achieve the latter. The reason of course is that governments cannot create gold out of thin air, like they do paper dollars. That is the wisdom the framers enshrined in the Constitution. Let¡¯s hope Mr Trump values their wisdom and re-establishes the monetary legacy they left for us. A sound dollar helped build a great country where everybody was given the opportunity for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
As president with a Republican controlled Congress, Trump can change everything. America¡¯s best hope is he rescinds Nixon¡¯s ¡°temporary¡± suspension of the dollar¡¯s redeemability into gold and puts the dollar back on a credible gold standard at $10,000 per ounce.¡± For those who are interested in hearing more about the gold market and the Trump shocker, KWN has just released   gold,   more. and you can listen to this extraordinary interview   Legend Art Cashin On A Trump Presidency, The New World Order, Gold, Brexit, The Great Depression And Why We Will See Panic  ",english,2016-11-16T00:07:38.365+02:00,kingworldnews.com,US,53149,Is President Trump Really Going To Revalue Gold To This Jaw-Dropping Price?,0,http://kingworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KWN-Ing-I-942016.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Trump shares have gained sharply in the IEM prediction market, rising from under 10 cents to about 29 cents. Ordinary polls also are showing the race tightening. Clinton leads, but the suddenly much higher volatility of prices means that Trump¡¯s prospects have improved. 
Trump released his contract with America 6 days ago. The biased media ignored it. 
The failures of Obamacare made headlines coincident with Trump¡¯s shares rising. 
Donna Brazile¡¯s passing debate questions to Clinton is also coincident with Clinton falling and Trump rising. 
The continuous Wikileaks revelations about Clinton are also coincident with the Trump comeback. My guess is that a good many voters who (naively) respect the integrity of the FBI are dismayed as they learn how Clinton interfered with the investigation and how the FBI was corrupted. (These are voters, and there are many, who think J. Edgar Hoover is a hero and who have never heard of entrapment.) Others are bound to be affected by the huge sums of money handed over to the Clintons where quid pro quos are evident. Charitable giving cannot explain these transfers. Yet others who support the Second Amendment are being solidified against Clinton by revelations that she intends to use executive orders to get her way. 
Clinton and Trump have taken opposite positions on the integrity of America¡¯s voting methods. Trump¡¯s position has been helped by recent complaints of machines that switched votes from one candidate to the opposition. Clinton¡¯s position has been hurt by (a) her own manipulations during the Democratic primaries, and (b) her attempts to link Trump¡¯s position with the bogeyman Russians. 
Furthermore, Clinton accused him of treason when she said ¡°We also know from the former head of our Counterterrorism Center, Matt Olsen, that the kinds of rhetoric and language that Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries.¡± Her extremism in this charge signals her fear of Trump¡¯s challenge. It could only cause Trump supporters to close ranks behind him and assure greater voter turnout for him. 
Clinton¡¯s many baseless charges and wild exaggerations show yet again her fondness for character assassination and attacks on anyone she perceives as an obstacle to her ambitions. 11:52 am on October 28, 2016",english,2016-10-28T21:15:06.549+03:00,lewrockwell.com,US,26413,Trump¡¯s Prospects Improve,0,https://www.lewrockwell.com//wp-content/themes/lrc/images/logo-med.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Sex advice columnist Dan Savage is often outspoken about his concerns with how politicians treat minorities, women, and the LGBT community. In a recent interview, Savage took a break from giving relationship advice and revealed a theory he has about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. 
Speaking with host Mike Pesca on Slate ¡®s The Gist podcast, Savage tried his hand at figuring out the root of Trump¡¯s misogynistic comments and alleged sexual assault : ¡°I¡¯ve never really said this out loud before, so forgive me if I say this in an inarticulate way, but I¡¯ve encountered over my life straight guys who hated women so much that you could almost sense that if gay was a choice, they would make it.¡± 
Trump has an almost pathological need to be seen as powerful and in control, and Savage thinks that need, as well as fear of the power of female sexuality, is the root of his misogynistic behavior: ¡°They¡¯re condemned to sit with both their hatred and disgust with women and their fear of women¡¯s bodies and their insecurity and their need for them, their desire for them, because they are who they are sexually attracted to, and the cognitive dissonance that can produce ¡ª you see those guys who are much more comfortable in the company of men, but they need this thing¡­ They need this woman, and they need her as an object. They can¡¯t see her as a human being, or see them as human beings.¡± 
Savage states that he does not think Trump is actually gay, but that he would probably be happier if he was, since he would never have to interact with women in that case. 
Savage¡¯s biggest concern with the Trump campaign is not the actual candidate, however. He is more concerned with the hatred and vitriol that the Republican party has adopted because of him: ¡°I¡¯m more concerned that, like climate change, assault is now a partisan issue, and that¡¯s going to play out for 30 years¡­ You¡¯ve got the Giulianis and the Gingriches from their moral high grounds defending this. You¡¯ve got rank-and-file Republican knuckle-draggers ¡ª including Republican women ¡ª defending this.¡± 
It should be noted that both former New York City mayor Rudy Guiliani and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich adamantly defend Trump in the face of sexual assault allegations. It should also be noted that both have been married multiple times and engaged in very public affairs. 
It will be up to those ¡°rank-and-file¡± Republicans to put the ugly, misogynist rhetoric of Donald Trump behind them after election day. Hopefully Savage is wrong when he says that he expects this to be a partisan issue for 30 years. 
Check out another interview from Savage here , where he refers to Trump as the ¡°enemy of the LGBT community.¡±

It¡¯s been over 71 years since nuclear weapons were used in anger but Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump believes that the next atomic war is just around the corner. Speaking to Reuters yesterday he said : ¡°What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria. You¡¯re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.¡± Unclear Fusion Of Ideas 
You might have noticed that Trump is a little obsessed with the idea of nuclear war. He talks about it a lot . He seems to be attracted to the idea of simply smiting his enemies, in much the same way the God of the Old Testament used to deal with those who failed to show the proper respect. It¡¯s more than a little disturbing. 
Especially when you realize how little he understands geopolitical reality. His grasp of such things are so facile that they border on criminal levels of ignorance. If anyone is likely to fire off a couple of nukes, it¡¯s Trump. 
When told by CNN¡¯s Chris Matthews that world leaders didn¡¯t want to hear that a man running for president wanted to use nuclear weapons on his enemies, Trump asked simply : ¡°Then why are we making them?¡± 
The answer to that question dates back to 1957 when Horrace Gaither presented President Eisenhower with the controversial Deterrence & Survival in the Nuclear Age report. The report was commissioned in order to research how best the United States might provide fallout shelters for its citizens. It soon reached a chilling and unexpected conclusion. The best a fallout shelter could achieve was to allow Americans the agony of a slow painful death. 
Indeed, the only way to survive a nuclear war was to ensure that one never happened. Plans to build mass civilian shelters were sidelined in favor of a policy that was given the most aptly chosen acronym of all times: Mutually Assured Destruction. M.A.D. 
That Trump has failed to master even a high school level understanding of geopolitics is kind of a big deal. 
He seems to believe that foreign policy actions are something that can be intuited, rather than studied. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , for example has been in force since 1970. The whole reason for its existence is to limit access to nuclear weapons. 
With a few notable exceptions, the treaty has been a success. 
Not so, says Trump. 
In March , he suggested that Japan, a country constitutionally forbidden from the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes, should create its own nuclear weapons. Citing America¡¯s inability to pay for Japan¡¯s protection, he felt that they might benefit from their very own atomic security blanket. 
President Barack Obama was concise in his assessment of Trump¡¯s plan. Speaking at a press conference during the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit in Washington DC, he said : ¡°The person who made the statements doesn¡¯t know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean peninsula or the world generally ¡­ We don¡¯t want somebody in the Oval Office who doesn¡¯t recognize how important that is.¡± Nuclear Bore 
The 71 years that have passed without any nation using devastating WMD on one another did not happen by accident. At the close of World War II, statesmen were forced to tackle the realities of modern warfare. World War I killed 5 million people and wounded 12 million more. WWII killed ten times that number. An atomic war might kill us all. 
In fact, it almost certainly would. 
Their plans, treaties, and compromises were far from perfect, but they worked, and they continue to work. We can be thankful for that. 
Because if there were to be such a war in 2017, it wouldn¡¯t be Clinton pressing the button. 
It would be the satsuma-like hand of a volatile, narcissistic amateur deciding to rage-quit a world that just doesn¡¯t seem to understand what a wonderful, tremendous guy he is. 
Watch Trump refuse to rule out the use of nuclear weapons:

There was a battle royale this morning on CNN, and when it was over with, host Chris Cuomo made sure Rudy Giuliani was reduced to rubble. 
The interview began with Cuomo telling the former New York City mayor that he didn¡¯t smile very much at last week¡¯s Al Smith charity dinner when Hillary Clinton took a few comedic jabs at him: ¡°You looked like Grumpy Cat.¡± 
Sullen and sour, Giuliani said Clinton should be in prison and wearing an orange jumpsuit. But when Rudy began trying to filibuster, Cuomo interrupted him and said he while he might not agree with the decision the FBI made to not charge Clinton with any wrongdoing when it came to her email server, Giuliani wasn¡¯t entitled to make things up: 
Next, Giuliani began ranting about some ¡°bribe¡± that predated the email controversy, and that was when Cuomo shut him down with one line : ¡°My entire life because you¡¯re so accurate and all of a sudden, you¡¯re in Trumpland and the facts are all over the place.¡± 
As if he hadn¡¯t been embarrassed enough, Giuliani then attempted to start talking about the recent announcement that Obamacare premiums will rise by as much as 25 percent in 2017: ¡°As a result, because the Democrats forced this down the Republicans¡¯ throat, the ACA, they decided to punish them. And they won¡¯t work with the Democrats to fix any of the problems that they could fix.¡± 
Cuomo was ready for that line, too, and again lit into his guest : ¡°Oh, that¡¯s a bunch of nonsense. They created it themselves. They cut out bipartisan support.¡± 
When it was over with, you could tell by the look on Rudy¡¯s face that he knew he had just been bested. Maybe Trump should rethink letting the unhinged Giuliani be one of his main surrogates. He really stinks at it. 
Here¡¯s both parts of the interview:

Samantha Bee, decked out in a ¡°Nasty Woman¡± shirt, wasted no time getting the jabs in at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on her Monday night show.

It¡¯s like you spotted Hillary painting a tunnel entrance onto a mountain, called her on it, and then ran at it anyway.¡± 
Bee pivoted to Trump¡¯s controversial statement from the last debate, in which he said he may not accept the election results.

Just after the Republican National Convention, I told you that a number of Donald Trump¡¯s top surrogates have known for some time that the Donald¡¯s signature policy proposal¨Ca massive wall along the Mexican border¨C only exists in Trump¡¯s mind . They have all but admitted what we already know¨Ca 2,000-mile physical wall is simply not feasible. 
Well, we got more confirmation earlier this week from another prominent Trump surrogate. Specifically, his chief foreign policy adviser admitted what we have long suspected¨Cwhen Trump declares, ¡°I¡¯m building a wall,¡± he¡¯s just engaging in campaign hype. 
People for the American Way¡¯s Right Wing Watch noticed that on Monday, veteran foreign policy and terrorism expert Walid Phares sat down with France 24¡¯s Surabhi Tandon to discuss Trump¡¯s approach to foreign policy. Phares served as a top foreign policy adviser to the Mitt Romney campaign, and took up the same role with Trump. He is best known as an ardent Islamophobe who had close ties to extremist militia groups during the civil war in his native Lebanon. 
The conversation soon turned to Trump¡¯s wall. Right Wing Watch got a clip. 
Tandon asked Phares how Trump¡¯s planned wall would affect the United States¡¯ relationship with Mexico; Trump has let it be known that one way or another, Mexico will foot the bill for the wall. Phares replied that Trump plans to build the wall along the American side of the border. However, as far as he knows, it won¡¯t be a brick-and-mortar wall. ¡°Now, will we see a physical wall on hundreds and hundreds of miles of border? I don¡¯t know, and I don¡¯t think so.¡± 
According to Phares, what Trump has in mind is something like what exists in Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves in north Africa. He claimed that there was a simple concept in place in those cities for anyone who wanted to cross into Spain via Morocco¨C¡°you come, you knock on the door, you have your paper, and you come in.¡± 
Tandon pounced, reminding Phares that Trump has been clamoring for a physical wall for the entire campaign. But this major Trump surrogate apparently didn¡¯t get the memo. Phares claimed that Trump only talked about building a wall ¡°to raise the attention.¡± However, since then, Phares has said that Trump has ¡°evolved the concept¡± of a wall. How so? ¡°Meaning, ¡®If nothing is done, I¡¯m going to go back to square one and build a wall. But if I can start talking with the Mexicans, I may not have to do all the wall everywhere because the Mexican government is going to finally send troops to stop these cartels.'¡± 
But wait a minute. Trump himself has declared the wall will stretch along the entire border. And he even managed to get the wall into the Republican platform. See for yourself , on page 26: ¡°(W)e support building a wall along our southern border and protecting all ports of entry. The border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.¡± 
And yet, a major Trump surrogate¨Cindeed, his top surrogate on foreign policy¨Chas effectively left his candidate on an island. 
Watch the whole thing here ; the exchange about the wall begins at the 6:30 mark. As I write this on Wednesday night, I can find no evidence that either Trump or the RNC has spoken up to correct the record. And I can find no evidence that Phares himself has tried to clarify his remarks. I can only conclude one thing¨CTrump himself knows he¡¯s not building a wall. About Darrell Lucus

Oh, ha,ha,ha! 
That silly old Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is so, so funny! 
He doesn¡¯t seem to remember anything. He doesn¡¯t remember what he has done , or what he has said , or what he believed or didn¡¯t believe in the recent past. 
Now we have another example of Trump insisting that he said what he didn¡¯t say, that he didn¡¯t say what he said, and that he never believed what he said he believed. 
Confused? 
Yup. We are, too. 
Mediate reports that Trump¡¯s memory about Obamacare is very murky, too. The candidate has been hitting the stump hard claiming that he will overturn the ¡°disaster¡± of Obamacare. 
In fact, Trump has been claiming to anyone who will listen that he has always been against Obama¡¯s health care plan. To listen to him, you would think that the man had taken to the airwaves as soon as the Affordable Care Act was passed, proclaiming that it would be the end of civilization as we know it. 
Except that he didn¡¯t. 
After it was announced the other day that insurance premiums are going to be increasing this year, Trump pumped his fists and congratulated himself with his usual fervor. He crowed to Fox News: ¡°I think it¡¯s a disaster, and I¡¯ve been saying it from the time before they even voted for it. I said this is a plan can¡¯t work, it¡¯s going to be a disaster.¡± He told Rush Limbaugh that : ¡°Obamacare is a disaster. And you remember, I called that from before it was approved. I said, ¡®This can¡¯t work, because it¡¯s just ¡­ the plan is no good. The concept is no good.¡¯¡± 
Once again, though, the truth seems to have nothing in common with Trump¡¯s faulty memory. In reality, back when the law was passed, Trump had not yet declared for the Presidency. He went on the air with Joy Behar on the day in 2010 when the law was passed. She asked him what he thought about the Act, and he replied that he had mixed feelings. 
Trump said that he hated to think about people being unable to get health care, but he worried about the cost to businesses. Then he commented on the President, saying: ¡°It¡¯s a pretty tough thing, but yeah, right now, he¡¯s certainly looking like a hero.¡± So. Um. Mr. Trump¡¯s memory is pretty damn shaky if you ask me. It seems that he is either trying to desperately to revise reality in order to put himself in a better light, or he is suffering from a very serious memory disorder.

At the third presidential debate last week, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made the mistake of calling Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton a ¡°nasty woman.¡± 
Just a couple of weeks ago, Trump was caught in some hot audio from an Access Hollywood bus in 2005. He famously said that he can ¡°grab them by the p***y¡± because he is a star. 
The Russian band, Pussy Riot, has released a new song in response to Trump¡¯s comment. It is called ¡°Straight Outta Vagina.¡± It is a very feminist and body-positive song. As women, we should all be proud of our bodies. Perverts like Donald Trump love to abuse us, but we can be stronger. 
Pussy Riot¡¯s Nadya Tolokonnikova told The Guardian : ¡°This song could be considered an answer to Trump. But I believe the idea of powerful female sexuality is much bigger than any populist megalomaniac man ¡­ Vagina is bigger than Trump.¡± 
NSFW: Graphic content. 
Here are some of the lyrics: ¡°Does your vagina have a brand? / Let your vagina start a band / If your vagina lands in prison / Then the world is gonna listen ¡°My vagina is tough and dangerous / Shaking up the major labels / Vagina gonna take the stage / Cuz vagina¡¯s got a lot to say ¡°My pussy my pussy / Is sweet just like a cookie / It goes to work / It makes the beats / It¡¯s CEO, no rookie / From senator to bookie / We run this shit, go lookie / ¡°Y ou can turn any page, any race, any age / From Russia to the states / We tearing up the place.¡± 
I¡¯ll warn you, the song is very catchy. Just watch who you sing it around. Rapists and abusers like Trump don¡¯t realize just how strong we women are. This song is a great way to celebrate our bodies.

Donald Trump held a rally Wednesday night in the crucial battleground state of North Carolina, and as he spoke, one of his supporters held up a Hillary Clinton doll with a noose around its neck. 
The woman who hung the Democratic nominee in effigy said her name was Ginger Glover. Glover said she decided to hang the ¡°Lyin¡¯ Hillary¡± doll to show that Clinton should be ¡°incarcerated, at the very least.¡± 
So does Glover wish harm on the former Secretary of State? She insisted she didn¡¯t: ¡°It¡¯s just for effect.¡± 
One is left wondering why, if Glover thinks Clinton should be imprisoned, she didn¡¯t dress the doll in an orange jumpsuit or prison stripes. Perhaps she¡¯s simply not bright enough to have thought of doing so. 
In recent weeks, various disturbing and violent displays have shown up at Trump rallies: Earlier this week at a rally in Virginia Beach, Trump supporters took a model of Clinton¡¯s head and mounted it on a stake. 
Also, at that same rally, reporters saw a poster which depicted a bull¡¯s-eye superimposed over Clinton¡¯s face. 
It should also be noted that a frequent chant heard at Trump rallies is the oft-repeated ¡°Lock her up¡± refrain which was a feature of the GOP convention in Cleveland. Yet the Trump campaign always denies that their supporters are are the least bit violent or seeking confrontations with those who disagree with them. 
Actions speak louder than words, and clearly the Trumpkins are a hate-filled basket of deplorables.

It¡¯s so much fun to watch as various right-wing morons and evangelical Christians attempt rationalize and even excuse the words and behavior of Donald Trump, who freely admitted that he enjoys sexually assaulting women by kissing them and grabbing their crotches against their will. Had a Democratic candidate done the same, they would be standing atop every high hill they could find and shouting that it was the end of the world and human morality. 
Now we have wackobird conspiracy theorist Wayne Allyn Root weighing in on the matter, and the reason he gives Trump a pass on the sexual assault is because he says there¡¯s just no way it could have happened because Trump is too handsome to have committed such an act. 
Appearing on the ¡°The Real Side¡± radio show, Root laid out this line of bullcrap : ¡°If you¡¯re a Christian, you just can¡¯t spend your life worrying about the words of Donald Trump from 11 years ago or what women he groped 30 years ago. I don¡¯t believe any of it anyway. I believe Donald Trump is one of the handsomest billionaires that¡¯s ever lived; I don¡¯t think he ever had to grope a single woman ever. I think they threw themselves at him, so it¡¯s all a lie.¡± 
Yeah, because a handsome man would never ever force himself on a woman. Are you kidding me?! Root then went on to add : ¡°The man isn¡¯t a perfect Christian, but he¡¯s the perfect guy sent from God and from central casting to be the vicious guy we needed to save America, save capitalism, fight the Clinton crime cartel and save Christianity from these vicious, vicious people. They¡¯re terrible, dirty people and a nice guy could have never won this war. Only a dirty player could win the war, so I think Donald¡¯s the perfect guy, sent by God to fill the perfect role and save us all.¡± 
There actually are no perfect Christians; that¡¯s kinda the point of that whole Jesus died for your sins thing, Wayne. And if you think a person as vile and perverted as Donald Trump was sent by God, then clearly you don¡¯t know this line from the Bible: ¡°And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.¡± ( Matthew 19:24 ) 
Here¡¯s Root proving his own ignorance:

Arrogance is defined as ¡°an insulting way of thinking or behaving that comes from believing that you are better, smarter, or more important than other people.¡± In other words, Donald Trump perfectly exemplifies arrogance, and he just proved that fact yet again. 
Appearing on Good Morning America Thursday morning, the GOP nominee readily defended the insulting posts he¡¯s made on Twitter: ¡°It¡¯s ok, most of them deserved it.¡± 
Trump then declared : ¡°I believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes I¡¯ll use that. And I agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it doesn¡¯t come out ¡ª you have to be careful with it.¡± 
When exactly has Trump been careful with what he posts on social media? Try never.

Does that mean she¡¯ll take away Donald¡¯s cell phone and duct tape his hands to his sides so he can¡¯t tweet out hateful and hurtful shit the way he normally does? Yeah, good luck with that, Melania! 
Earlier this week, the New York Times ran a two-page spread listing all of the insults and unkind postings Trump has made on Twitter since he announced he would be running for President in 2015. If you want to see a completely unhinged, uninformed, and unfiltered mind at work, just take a look at the Times article and recall what Hillary Clinton said regarding the Donald: ¡°A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.¡± 
Donald Trump cannot be trusted with a smart phone, let alone the reins of power for the most important nation in the world.

The famously thin-skinned Republican candidate Donald Trump will be feeling even more sensitive if he sees this hilarious ad that pokes fun at him. It takes its rightful place among the very wittiest political campaign ads. 
Produced in Denmark for the country¡¯s Socialist People¡¯s Party ( SF ), the bus-side ad is aimed at American expats, urging them to vote in the upcoming election. It¡¯s fairly obvious who they want those people to vote for. 
Like most of the best ads, it¡¯s as clever as it is simple. 
It shows Trump¡¯s unforgettably distinctive quiff and forehead but, just below it, a pair of big, googly eyes have been attached to the wheels. As the bus moves, Donald¡¯s eyes roll. 
Talking to a local broadcaster, the SF leader Pia Olsen said : ¡°It is meant to be a bit funny. One can¡¯t be in doubt that it was done tongue in cheek. We want to tell American citizens: Remember to vote, it has consequences.¡± 
As the election draws near, both parties can be expected to increase their efforts to attract votes from the large number of U.S. citizens abroad, which amount to as many as 8.7 million. 
Turnout among this sector is traditionally low, but it has also been proven that their input can be absolutely crucial. 
Al Gore would have won the 2000 election by 202 votes, if the 2,490 overseas ballots had been counted in time. 
Let¡¯s hope Americans in Denmark ¨C and everywhere else overseas ¨C see the serious side as well as the funny side, and make sure to get their vote in. 
Talking of clever ads, here¡¯s one for Audi , which was deliberately planned to air during the Trump-Clinton presidential debates. It¡¯s beautifully shot and directed, but it¡¯s the line at the very end that makes it especially relevant.

Ivana Trump, the first wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, confirmed what many of us have been thinking for a long time now: Trump is a childish buffoon. Her story of a young Donald Trump on the ski slopes is telling of the temperament we see in the nominee now. Ivana Trump: ¡®He Could Not Take It¡¯ 
Trump biographer Michael D¡¯Antonio spoke with Ivana Trump about her marriage to The Donald, and she remembered a time he took her skiing. This was early on, before they married, and one would think Donald would want to show his best side, right? 
No. 
You see, Ivana neglected to tell the young Donald Trump that she was a very accomplished skier. According to Ivana Trump, Donald skied down the slope first, and then: ¡°¡­ He goes and stops, and he says, ¡®Come on, baby. Come on, baby.¡¯ I went up. I went two flips up in the air, two flips in front of him. I disappeared. Donald was so angry, he took off his skis, his ski boots, and walked up to the restaurant. He could not take it. He could not take it.¡± 
She said he stormed off, saying: ¡°I¡¯m not going to do this for anybody, including Ivana.¡± 
We all know by now that Donald Trump is a man who doesn¡¯t like to lose. Ever. He is a man easily baited, easily goaded, and he has the temper of a petulant child. His outbursts have sparked the hashtag #trumpertantrum . 
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was correct when she said, in her speech at the Democratic National Convention: ¡°A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.¡± 
Nor is a man who storms off in a huff when bested by his girlfriend on the ski slopes. Donald Trump: ¡®I Loved To Fight¡¯ 
D¡¯Antonio also said that Donald told him how he loved a good fight. ¡°I loved to fight. I always loved to fight. All types of fights. Any kind of fight, I loved it, including physical.¡± 
There¡¯s a word for people who act like that: Bully. 
Of course, Trump has put his childish, bullying ways on display for the world during this election cycle. Ivana just happened to be one of his earlier victims. 
Watch their appearance on Oprah in 1988, when Trump said she does what he tells her to do:

See that wedge of people cheering behind the podium at political rallies? The ones who just so happen to sit nicely within the camera frame? They are always something of a fantasy construct. If a candidate has a problem with women voters, then the podium behind will be packed tightly with women. If some number cruncher decides that Black men would rather vote for someone else, then they too get press-ganged into the formation of a human canvas. A little bit of demographic sleight of hand if you will. 
It¡¯s no big deal. They all do it. It¡¯s a talking point, a visual cue for the doubters and a psychological nudge for the undecided. Any Color You Want So Long As It¡¯s White 
Of course, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has a problem with pretty much every non-white male demographic you can think of. And when it comes to Black voters, his poll numbers are so low that misrepresenting his demographic base is all but impossible. No matter how large your crowd is, a statistical zero still leaves you with a chronic shortage of Black people. And that means they cannot be used as props that detract from the massively racist campaign he¡¯s been running. Which must make him sad. 
Time for plan B. 
And no, that¡¯s not a racially insensitive name or a typo. That¡¯s his name, or at least, that¡¯s the one he is using right now. The Cultist Formerly Known As¡­ 
You might have seen Michael before. Back in 2012, during the Republican primary race, Rick Santorum asked him to front his campaign rally. Attendants were treated to an excruciatingly awful jazz set , followed by rabid claims that Democrats are all closet Nazis. He told the crowd : ¡°The Democrats, they¡¯re the worst thing that ever happened to the Black man. They¡¯re the slave masters.¡± 
So, right off the bat, we know we¡¯re dealing with someone who has some legitimate political arguments to make. That¡¯s good to know. 
The ¡°Blacks for Trump¡± placards that wafted in the torrid zephyr sliding past Trump¡¯s rally in Sanford, Florida last Tuesday were hard to miss. The inane grin of a middle-aged white woman, holding one of the signs at arm¡¯s length as if afraid the word ¡®black¡¯ might come and get her, was particularly memorable. 
The man stood next to her, wearing a T-shirt that read ¡°Republicans Aren¡¯t Racist¡± was less conspicuous but keen-eyed observers recognized his familiar brand of crazy from past GOP events. It was none other than our man Michael. 
You know, the Black Man. Trump¡¯s Cult Following 
He wasn¡¯t born with that name of course. Previous names include Maurice Woodside and Michael Symonette while his website lists it as Michel Nicholson. Go figure. 
As a former high-ranking member of the Nation of Yahweh ¡ª a violent black supremacist organization ¡ª he has good reason to keep his true name secret. The cult disintegrated in the 1980s shortly after its leader, Yahweh ben Yahweh , was arrested on conspiracy charges relating to 14 murders committed in Miami. Yahweh was convicted and eventually served 11 years of an 18-year sentence before his death in 2007. 
Michael has had his share of legal problems too. 
Implicated, but never convicted of two separate murders, he has since been charged with ¡ª though again, never convicted ¡ª of four separate felonies since the cult crashed and burned. 
And according to the New Miami Times , Michael still cuts something of a radical figure. They describes him as being : ¡°An anti-gay, anti-liberal preacher with a golden instinct for getting on TV at GOP events.¡± 
And just like that, all of a sudden, his support for Trump begins to make a lot of sense.

New video from a Cub Scout meeting in Kansas shows Representative Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) pledging to support his party¡¯s presidential candidate, Donald Trump ¨C no matter what. ¡°I¡¯m going to be supporting the Republican nominee, no matter what crazy things he says.¡± 
Yoder¡¯s admission is shameful enough on its own. But the worst part is his audience ¨C a group of Cub Scouts, aged 7-10. 
The video, taken October 11, was recorded shortly after the release of the now-infamous ¡° Pussy Tape ¡± in which Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. Yoder even made a joke about Trump¡¯s scandalous comments: ¡°A-ha! Which parent put him up to that? Is there a hot mic in here? Well, I¡¯m a Republican, so I¡¯m going to be supporting the Republican nominee, no matter what crazy things he says.¡± A Lesson On ¡®Spin¡¯¨C For the Kids! 
Yoder dishonestly suggested that the child was not curious enough to ask the question on his own. But in fact, kids are quite aware of the impending election. An informal survey of teachers found high levels of youth anxiety ¨C especially among racial and ethnic minorities ¨C due to Donald Trump¡¯s inflammatory rhetoric. 
His reply also dishonestly implies that he¡¯s somehow obligated to vote along party lines. But the many Republican defections from the Donald Trump camp prove that is untrue. Yoder could have used the opportunity to teach the Scouts that they should always do the right thing, even if it means refusing to do what is easy and expected of you. Instead, he towed the party line. 
Perhaps Yoder needs a reminder from the Cub Scouts about where his loyalty should lie. According to the Scout Oath , decent citizens should pledge: ¡°On my honor I will do my best, to do my duty to God and my country¡­¡± Damage Control 
Yoder is running for a fourth term in a suburban Kansas City district. His team is already running damage control on the tape. Yoder spokesperson, C.J. Grover, played the remarks off as evidence of Yoder¡¯s ¡°quick wit.¡± ¡°Anyone who knows Kevin knows that he utilizes his quick wit to connect with voters. All this video shows is Kevin continues to be out in the community taking all questions from anyone who wants to ask them, whereas his opponent has been hiding in his basement hoping his financial backers in D.C. can steal him a victory.¡±

The Republican presidential candidate continues to prove himself too uninformed to be President of these United States. 
In his latest attack on the facts, Republican hopeful Donald Trump went on a rant against renewable energy. As is so typical for the shallow conservative, he seized the handiest and easiest idea to sell his argument. 
In essence, Donald Trump says that we can¡¯t have wind power because it kills all the birds. 
All the birds. Killed by wind turbines. 
Trump was particularly worried about the fate of the eagles. Of course he was. The eagle, the symbol of America. The easiest way to tug on the heartstrings on the uninformed is to threaten the very symbol of our nation. So he did. He claimed that ¡°thousands¡± of eagles are killed in California by wind energy. 
Trump appeared on a radio show the other day with Republican has-been Herman Cain. He said : ¡°[Wind power] kills all the birds. Thousands of birds are lying on the ground. And the eagle. You know, certain parts of California ¡ª they¡¯ve killed so many eagles. You know, they put you in jail if you kill an eagle. And yet these windmills [kill] them by the hundreds.¡± 
What an image! Hundreds of dead American eagles, all slaughtered by wind turbines. 
And in keeping with the unapologetic shallowness of his position, Trump went on to complain that wind turbines are unattractive. There is no insult in Trump world more powerful than ¡°ugly¡±. Here are Donald Trump's views on wind power, and Disneyland: https://t.co/mphn1qSbGU pic.twitter.com/ja1j6wltBx 
¡ª Daniel Dale (@ddale8) October 26, 2016 
So wind energy is ugly, inefficient and it kills all of those wonderful noble eagles. 
Except that NONE of that is true. None of it. 
Here is the truth, not that it will matter to the fact averse Donald Trump. 
While it is true that many birds are killed by wind turbines (up to 368,000 annually), that figure looks low when compared to the number of birds killed by cell towers each year (6.8 million). 
The biggest killer of birds is¡­.are you ready? Cats. Cats kill up to 3.7 billion birds a year. 
As for those eagles? The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says that two eagles were killed by wind turbines in Palm Springs since 1997. 
Trump¡¯s rant seems even more deceitful when we consider the fact that climate change is the greatest threat to birds in the world. The Audubon Society says that up to half of the bird species on earth are threatened by rising global temperatures. 
Donald Trump appears to be incapable of understanding or accepting reality. He says that climate change is a hoax created by China. He claims that wind turbines are killing ¡°all the birds.¡± He mourns the loss of hundreds of eagles who haven¡¯t died. 
Whatever it is that he wants to be true is what he believes to be true. 
He is delusional. He is dangerous. He has to be stopped.

Why is that only the Blacks for Trump crowd can see it? 
The crime ridden streets. The sense of hopelessness. Black men loitering outside buildings, taking causal pot shots at each other across barely-lit streets strewn with human refuse. Black women sobbing quietly to themselves, their fingers raw from the caustic touch of the White-folk laundry they labor over. Dark-hued children scampering through the streets barefoot, clutching prizes grubbed from garbage that ooze like the bloated carcasses of animals lost to the summer heat. A half-eaten apple, a burger entombed in the husk of a once-edible bun. 
Such treats. 
Or rather, to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump¡¯s version of certain parts of America. Africa-America 
Donald Trump has lived in a bubble his entire life. His has been a life of privilege and of entitlement. He has never ventured out into the Black communities he is so quick to criticize; he¡¯s never had to experience any of the hardships he pretends to lament. 
Which helps explain a few things, I guess. Like why he refused to rent property to non-whites back in the 1970s. The answer is simple. 
Because the man is fixated on a view of the lives of Black Americans so painfully anachronistic that it¡¯s just plain racist. 
To listen to him, you¡¯d think that we were still living in plantation-era America. Speaking to Fox News ¡® Jeanine Pirro last August, he described the lives of Black people in U.S. as a: ¡°Total catastrophe, the unemployment rates, everything is bad ¡ª no health care, no education, no anything, no anything.¡± 
He went on to make the kind of pitch to the Black demographic that was as inept as it was inappropriate. ¡°Then, I said, ¡®Hey, wait a minute, vote for me. What have you got to lose? You can¡¯t do worse, you can¡¯t do any worse than what these people have been doing and I will do better.'¡± 
It¡¯s not that his observations are entirely without merit. Serious inequality absolutely does exist in the United States. RE: Reality Check 
Income inequality between Black people and White people is worse today that it was in 1979. That¡¯s on both parties. Gaps in household incomes persist and home ownership is divided along ethnic lines. That¡¯s on both major parties too. 
And that¡¯s just the tip of the iceberg. Five times as many White people are using drugs as Black, yet Black people are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of White people. And then there are the shootings , the mistrust, the blatant prejudice. 
So yes, there is a lot of work to be done. But to say that ¡®they¡¯ have nothing is yet one more reason why this man is unfit to be president. To dismiss their gains, to dismiss the vibrancy of their communities, the impact they have had on popular culture, and even the very fact that a Black man is in the White House. To do that is to demean those very same achievements. 
It seems that somebody in the Trump camp agrees. Trump 2.0 
On Wednesday, in Charlotte, North Carolina, speaking to an overwhelmingly White crowd, Donald Trump laid out his ¡®new¡¯ new deal for Black people, taking aim at those people who were, in his eyes, living in the very worst kind of Dickensian squalor. 
As you might expect for a man whose hands are too tiny to pull a trigger, he missed the mark by quite some margin. 
Gone was his insistence that the unconstitutional stop-and-frisk policy had been a rousing success. Gone was his blundering critique of the ongoing tension between the Black community and law enforcement. 
Instead, he treated us to a new tactic. Sure it was a rehash of the lines that helped him exploit the post-truth delusional mindset of disaffected White people across the country but so what? It¡¯s not like his approval rating with Black people could get any lower, right? He said : ¡°Illegal immigration violates the civil rights of African-Americans.¡± 
Sticking to his usual modus operandi , he offered no evidence whatsoever to back this claim. Instead he forged ahead with yet more unsubstantiated bullshit : ¡°No group has been more economically harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African-American workers.¡± 
Ever the defender of the underdog, Trump proceeded to rail against Wall Street, Clinton, and tax laws for a few minutes before admitting, almost as an afterthought, that he wanted to pass legislation that would prioritize helping Black people with businesses : ¡°Get the credit they need.¡± 
Incredibly, this close to the election, he did not feel the need to tell the crowd what the legislation would be. Maybe he doesn¡¯t know. Maybe he just said it for fun. 
Who the hell knows anymore? Comic Relief 
Although some attempt at softening his stance seems to have been made, the old rhetoric was still there. He pointed to slow growth of what he called ¡°blighted communities,¡± and promised to : ¡°¡­ Seek a federal disaster designation ¡­ in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties and the increased presence of law enforcement.¡± 
Presumably with the intention of doing the rebuilding himself. Or rather, getting someone else to do the work, slapping his name on it and then politely asking all the Black people to get the fuck out of the way because, you know, they kind of spoil his view.

Today, in an ABC News interview with George Stephanopoulos, Trump sounded off about Mosul. ¡°So you can tell your military expert that I¡¯ll sit down and I¡¯ll teach him a couple of things.¡± 
In Trump¡¯s experience-free opinion, Mosul is a ¡°total disaster¡± because we gave too much notice of the attack. The attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months of notice. U.S. is looking so dumb. VOTE TRUMP and WIN AGAIN! 
¡ª Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2016 
Trump made similar comments during the last presidential debate . ¡°The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.¡± 
Unfortunately for Trump, real military experts disagree. The next day, the New York Times reported that such warnings reduce civilian casualties and instill fear within the enemy, among other benefits. Then there was this quote: ¡°¡®What this shows is Trump doesn¡¯t know a damn thing about military strategy,¡¯ said Jeff McCausland, a retired Army colonel and former dean at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa.¡± 
Today, Stephanopoulos asked Trump about his tweet and McCausland¡¯s comment. Trump doubled down . Oh, and check out how he first referred to General George Patton: ¡°The Army War College ¨C let me tell you, the element of surprise. I¡¯ve been hearing about Mosul now for three months, ¡®We¡¯re going to attack. We¡¯re going to attack.¡¯ Meaning Iraq¡¯s going to attack but with us, OK? We¡¯re going to attack. Why do they have to talk about it? Don¡¯t talk about it. Element of surprise. General George Patent [sic].¡± 
Trump subsequently correctly referred to Patton. But his later comments probably did nothing to reassure anyone about his suitability as commander in chief. Besides his desire to lecture McCausland, Trump brushed aside a challenge to his dire assessment of the Mosul operation. 
When Stephanopoulos noted that Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said 35 ISIS leaders have been killed, Trump insisted : ¡°Excuse me: The resistance is much greater now because they knew about the attack. Why can¡¯t they win first and talk later? Why do they have to say, three months before the attack, we¡¯re going in?¡± 
Of course, Trump provided no evidence to support his argument that a surprise attack would have worked better. But why would he? In Trump¡¯s mind, he knows better than anyone about fighting ISIS, as he said last year that: ¡°I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.¡± 
Fortunately, it looks like most Americans don¡¯t believe him.

Pretty cool! This restores my faith in Americans, for sure. 
It seems that there are a lot of people who are disgusted with Trump¡¯s constant threats to sue. USA Today reports that Trump has been involved in over 3, 500 lawsuits. He routinely uses the law to badger and intimidate his opponents. 
Trump has famously refused to pay contractors who have worked on his multi-million dollar projects. When those small companies ask for payment, Trump glibly tells them to take him to court, knowing that the costs would stop them from going forward. They end up settling for cents on the dollar, every time. 
He has also threatened to sue various media outlets when they report information that he doesn¡¯t like. Donald Trump threatens legal action against NBC over 'Access Hollywood' tape https://t.co/IWhwwHcHjz via @CNNMoney

That threat, as well as his threats to sue the media, prompted the famous lawyer to send his original tweet offering a pro bono defense. The response to his offer has been excellent. Boutrous said : ¡°Ever since I sent that tweet, the outpouring from other lawyers and people who want to help is just incredible. It was so offensive to fundamental First Amendment values and democratic principles to have someone threaten to sue people who are criticizing him. The First Amendment is designed to protect exactly that kind of speech.¡± 
This is the part that Donald Trump seems incapable of understanding. It is a violation of the U.S. Constitution to deny people the right to speak freely, even if they criticize you.

Donald Trump has tried to deny that he is the person most responsible for keeping alive claims that President Obama wasn¡¯t born in the United States and is therefore not eligible to serve as President. The GOP nominee has been the chief proponent of what is now known as ¡°birtherism.¡± And yet when asked about the matter, Trump tries to shift the blame to Hillary Clinton and her campaign staff in the 2008 Democratic race. 
Now, however, we have proof that Trump was indeed the driving force of birtherism, and that proof comes from the mouth of his son, Eric. 
NBC news found audio of Eric Trump talking to biographer Michael D¡¯Antonio, author of The Truth About Trump . In that audio, the Trump son admits: ¡°I think with the birthers it¡¯s, ¡®Okay, well, then, just prove it. Meaning these people are going out saying that which a lot of people were at the time. ¡®Then just show us. Just be transparent. You¡¯re the leader of the free world, be transparent.¡¯ There are underlying themes to this, and in fact, he has done his best to start the conversation that was unwilling to be had before. Now that conversation might flush itself out in one of several different ways. But at least the conversation is being had.¡± 
Yes, at least we are trying to question the nationality of the first African-American President in the history of the United States. Nothing nefarious or the least bit racist about that, is there? Bullshit! Donald Trump knew exactly what he was doing when he repeatedly called for President Obama to release his birth certificate, and he did so to garner media attention as he considered running for the GOP nomination years before he finally did. 
Donald Trump is a lying weasel and racist asshat who needs to be defeated soundly on November 8. He and his hateful ideas must be resoundingly rejected by the American people, who deserve better than the division he offers.

Maybe you¡¯ve noticed that in recent weeks the people who advise and speak on behalf of the Donald Trump campaign seem to be more angry and defensive than usual. No doubt that has something to do with the fact that they realize their candidate is about to lose badly on Election Day. 
The perfect example of this was provided last night by Trump senior advisor AJ Delgado, who was appearing with GOP strategist Rick Wilson, who is supporting third-party candidate Evan McMullin. When host Chris Hayes mentioned Trump¡¯s ties to white supremacists, Delgado got very agitated and said she was offended by the accusation. Hayes replied : ¡°I just want to distinguish between two claims. If you¡¯re a Trump supporter you¡¯re there for a racist or white supremacist which I would never say and don¡¯t think Rick would say. The people out there that are racist and white supremacist, they¡¯re overwhelmingly and publicly supporting Donald Trump.¡± 
Delgado yelled: ¡°That¡¯s not true!¡± 
Wilson then joined the conversation, telling Delgado: ¡°AJ, it is true. The people on the white supremacists alt-right movement in this country flock to Donald Trump.¡± 
Later in the debate, Delgado claimed that the average voter doesn¡¯t care about Trump¡¯s support from white supremacists such as David Duke, former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Wilson let Delgado have it for that comment: ¡°This is a guy who is feeding these people with a nod and a wink every single day. A guy who constantly denigrates women, Muslims, minorities in a host of different ways. I¡¯m not saying every person who supports Donald Trump is a racist, that¡¯s absurd. Every racist you turn over ¡ª every time you turn over a rock and find a racist, they have a red MAGA hat on. There is not a ¡ª there¡¯s not a coincidence here.¡± 
Exactly! Trump has been playing footsie with neo-Nazis, the KKK, and other white supremacist/white nationalist groups since he started his campaign. For him or anyone who supports him to now appear offended when someone makes that connection is not only disingenuous, it¡¯s downright ludicrous. As the old saying goes, If you lie down with dogs, you wake up with fleas.

Donald Trump has spent most of the campaign blowing dog whistles to his supporters. For instance, he¡¯s gone as far as to claim that Hillary Clinton is in cahoots with ¡°international banks¡± ¨Ca ¡°polite¡± term for ¡°Jews.¡± Well, Bill Clinton told a crowd in North Carolina that Trump¡¯s campaign slogan may be the biggest dog whistle of all. 
The Big Dog was on the stump with state attorney general and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Roy Cooper in Cooper¡¯s hometown of Rocky Mount. While pushing his wife¡¯s economic and education plans, Clinton said that when Trump says he wants to ¡°make America great again,¡± he¡¯s all but announcing that he wants to stick it to the poor and minorities. ¡°I¡¯m a white southerner ¨C I know what ¡®Make America Great Again¡¯ means, and all of you of a certain age know exactly what it means. I didn¡¯t fall off this truck yesterday, I¡¯ve heard this song a long time. It means first, I¡¯ll give you the economy you had 50 years ago, and second, I¡¯ll give you the society you had 50 years ago: I¡¯ll move you up and move somebody else down.¡± 
Bill actually used the slogan himself during his 1992 campaign. However, he¡¯s not at all fond of Trump¡¯s idea of greatness. 
This largely continues a theme Hillary has kept up for the entire campaign¨Ctrolling Trump¡¯s faux-populist slogans. If you¡¯ll remember, when Trump tried to counter the popular Hillary hashtag ¡°#ImWithHer¡± with one of his own, ¡°#ImWithYou,¡± Hillary¡¯s campaign team called it out for the dog whistle that it was. You* 
¡ª Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 22, 2016 
At least one Trump supporter has already admitted that ¡°Make America Great Again¡± is a dog whistle. Earlier, when one of Trump¡¯s delegates from California, William Johnson, was outed as a white supremacist, he said that Trump wants to roll things back to the days when women were expected to stay in the kitchen. 
Despite the retrograde vision Trump has for the country, Clinton urged the crowd in Rocky Mount not to return the hate Trump and his supporters have displayed with hate of their own. ¡°Do not treat them with the anger they often display toward us ¨C love them to death. Look at them and say, ¡®we need you.'¡± 
That, ladies and gentlemen, is why America is already great. Perhaps someone needs to remind Trump of that. After all, he¡¯s going to get a very sobering reminder of this on Election Day.

Evangelical Christians have been major players in the 2016 elections with their unrelenting support of Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, but Alan Noble, Ph.D., is putting his foot down and letting the Religious Right know what they are doing is wrong. 
In a current op-ed for Vox , Noble takes to history, the Bible, and the way of the conservative to point out that somewhere in the recent past, Evangelicals have lost their sense of priority in the character of a man. When discussing the release of tapes where Trump was caught admitting to sexually assaulting women Noble stated: ¡°Evangelicalism has been sharply divided over Trump, and so my hope was that this tape would finally persuade the remaining evangelical defenders of Trump to abandon him. But for the most part, that¡¯s not what happened.¡± 
Just as we have seen numerous times in the media, while many Trump supporters were running in the other direction, there were still an enormous amount of influential conservatives battening down the hatches and riding through this storm, still defending the man. 
Men like Jerry Falwell Jr., Ben Carson, Tony Perkins, Mike Huckabee, and more , have either stayed steady with their support or have come back to the ¡°Trump Side,¡± shortly after jumping ship, all taking the stance that America should focus less on character and more on policy. Noble discusses the Christian Conservative view this election season by saying : ¡°Jalsevac makes explicit the logic of so many leaders on the religious right: Character is fundamentally private and only tangentially related the public work of policymaking and politics. Sin is still bad, but since we are all sinners, and since we are not electing a ¡°pastor in chief,¡± what matters most is what kind of president the candidates would be. The real is the political. Everything else is just style.¡± 
Here is the kicker, though, the pushing off of character and focusing on policy way of thinking for the Christian Conservative was the complete opposite when former President Bill Clinton confessed to his indiscretions while in office. In fact, the Southern Baptist Convention passed a ¡° Resolution on the Moral Characters of Public Officials ,¡± after Clinton¡¯s incident stating: ¡°WHEREAS, Some journalists report that many Americans are willing to excuse or overlook immoral or illegal conduct by unrepentant public officials so long as economic prosperity prevails; and WHEREAS, Tolerance of serious wrong by leaders sears the conscience of the culture, spawns unrestrained immorality and lawlessness in the society, and surely results in God¡¯s judgment (1 Kings 16:30; Isaiah 5:18-25); and ¡­ Therefore, be it RESOLVED, That we, the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting June 9-11, 1998, in Salt Lake City, Utah, affirm that moral character matters to God and should matter to all citizens, especially God¡¯s people when choosing public leaders; and ¡­ Be it finally RESOLVED, That we urge all Americans to embrace and act on the conviction that character does count in public office, and to elect those officials and candidates who, although imperfect, demonstrate consistent honesty, moral purity, and the highest character.¡± 
Ultimately what this is saying is that if someone is placed in office with a severe lack of personal conviction, it can ultimately harm everyone involved; an entirely different viewpoint than the rhetoric they are putting forth about support for Donald Trump. And don¡¯t be mistaken, this position was held and represented as late as 2015 when Mike Huckabee responded during an interview to the millennial viewpoint of Bill Clinton¡¯s indiscretions by saying : ¡°Probably not, for two reasons. One, they were infants when it all happened. And the second reason is that growing up in a moral climate in which people just don¡¯t seem to care that much about other people¡¯s lives. They don¡¯t make the connection between personal character and public character. They don¡¯t seem to think that there is a correlation. I think there is. I think if a person will lie to an individual, they will lie to a country. I think if a person is not honest with themselves, they¡¯ll be dishonest with the voters. And so I do think character matters, I believe it always had. It doesn¡¯t mean we elect perfect people. We don¡¯t, we never have, we never will, but I do think that it matters that a person represents himself or herself with a level of authenticity and that doesn¡¯t always happen Hugh, and I do think it¡¯s one of the pitfalls of our current political environment.¡± Via Vox 
So while public figures like James Dobson endorse Trump with the, ¡°We are electing a commander-in-chief not a theologian-in-chief,¡± he was damning the idea of not holding Bill Clinton responsible for his moral character. In 1998, while President of Focus on the Family , Dobson wrote : ¡°As it turns out, character DOES matter. You can¡¯t run a family, let alone a country, without it. How foolish to believe that a person who lacks honesty and moral integrity is qualified to lead a nation and the world! Nevertheless, our people continue to say that the President is doing a good job even if they don¡¯t respect him personally. Those two positions are fundamentally incompatible. In the Book of James the question is posed, ¡°Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring¡± (James 3:11 NIV). The answer is no.¡± 
It seems to me the winds of the religious, political race have changed drastically and not to fit the idea that the Bible represents, but to satisfy lead religious bodies in their political views. As we are condemned for our lack of character in our everyday lives, Trump¡¯s character is swept to the side as nothing more than a luxury for a political candidate.

The Donald Trump for President campaign is filled with liars. From the candidate himself to the people who attempt to defend him on television, the default position for anyone who gets a paycheck from Trump is dishonesty. And perhaps no one better personifies this than spokesperson Katrina Pierson, who went so far on CNN this morning that she was threatened with a lawsuit. 
Pierson appeared, along with Democratic strategist Angela Rye, and Pierson began her lies by saying the American middle class is in trouble due to the economic policies of the Obama administration. Rye countered with facts : ¡°I would like to go back to something Katrina mentioned, which was the middle class is hurting. Well I would go to what we¡¯ve learned from the census bureau last year which is the middle class, and poor people, had the best year they¡¯ve had ever since ¡ª in 2015. In quite some time rather. I won¡¯t say ever. It says that real median household income was $56,500 in 2015. That is an increase from $53,700 the year prior. I would also point to you the fact that the unemployment rate is much lower than when President Obama started.¡± 
Then host Carol Costello played a video clip of Trump referring to ¡°ghettos,¡± and that led Rye to comment: ¡°People like Donald Trump actually take for granted the fact that they have readily available access to capital.¡± 
Pierson began spitting and sputtering, so Rye told her: ¡°I know you don¡¯t want to hear this because the truth burns.¡± 
Unable to come up with a reasoned defense, Pierson went personal, alleging that when Rye worked for the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), she ¡°ran (it) into the ground.¡± 
Rye replied: ¡°I ran the CBC into the ground? That¡¯s laughable.¡± 
When Carol Costello asked Pierson exactly what she was referring to, Pierson told her : ¡°The record is out there. Look at where the finances were.¡± 
Rye: ¡°Let me just help you. Good luck with that lie. That¡¯s crazy, what you¡¯re talking about. That¡¯s slander. I could sue you, Katrina.¡± 
Only problem is, if she did sue Pierson, she might not get much money. Pierson, you may recall, was arrested in 1997 for shoplifting and was also accused of illegally collecting unemployment benefits. Those who live in glass houses should never ever throw rocks at others, Katrina.

There¡¯s nothing wrong with being passionate when it comes to your political beliefs and the candidate you support. In an electorate as deeply divided as we currently see in this country, you expect no less. But ask yourself this question: If your candidate loses, are you ready to take up arms and try to overthrow the government? For some who ardently support GOP nominee Donald Trump, the answer is a resounding yes. 
Take for example Jared Halbrook, who lives in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and told the New York Times : ¡°People are going to march on the capitols. They¡¯re going to do whatever needs to be done to get her out of office, because she does not belong there. ¡°If push comes to shove, (Clinton) has to go by any means necessary, it will be done.¡± 
Roger Pillath said he also sees violence on the horizon if Clinton is elected: ¡°It¡¯s not what I¡¯m going to do, but I¡¯m scared that the country is going to go into a riot. I¡¯ve never seen the country so divided, just black and white ¡ª there¡¯s no compromise whatsoever. The Clinton campaign says together we are stronger, but there¡¯s no together. The country has never been so divided. I¡¯m looking at revolution right now.¡± 
As Trump continues to talk of the election being ¡°rigged,¡± his words are having an effect on people like Paul Swick, who had this ominous warning: ¡°If she comes after the guns, it¡¯s going to be a rough, bumpy road. I hope to God I never have to fire a round, but I won¡¯t hesitate to. As a Christian, I want reformation. But sometimes reformation comes through bloodshed.¡± 
Retired truck driver Alan Weegens envisions a very dark future for the United States and says he¡¯s ready to do whatever is necessary: ¡°I am not going to take my weapon to go out into the streets to protest an election I did not win. But I think that if certain events came about, a person would need to protect themselves, depending on where they lived, when your neighborhood goes up in flames.¡± 
See if you can recall the last time we heard this kind of violent talk which led to actions by far right nuts who were inspired to be ¡°heroes¡± in their own minds. The year was 1995 and Bill Clinton was President. Timothy McVeigh parked a rental truck loaded with explosives outside the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and killed 168 innocent Americans, including children. Words can have consequences.

For much of the summer and fall, there¡¯s been talk that if Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton, he will launch a right-leaning cable news channel. Well, it turns out someone may have just axed this latest Trump deal before it even got off the ground. The trademark for the network¡¯s most likely name has already been snapped up ¨Cby of all people, a Democrat. 
Earlier this week, the Trump campaign launched a live newscast on Trump¡¯s Facebook page, complete with guests. The campaign branded it as ¡°TrumpTV,¡± leading to speculation that it was a test for a Trump-branded network. The Trump campaign has been mulling such a venture since the primaries . 
However, they may have reckoned without Mark Grabowsky, a public health doctor from Manhattan and a lifelong Democrat. Grabowsky told Fortune magazine that he was watching on the debates when, purely at random, he did a search for ¡°Trump TV¡±¨Cand discovered that the trademark was still available. He filed copyright protection for it, jokingly describing it as a chance to ¡°get Russian investment money, go bankrupt, take a big claim and not pay taxes.¡± 
Grabowsky says he has no plans to actually launch a network, leading trademark expert Ann Ford to suggest that his claim could get axed by the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. But this could still have the effect of pulling the plug on Trump¡¯s planned network. If the trademark office decides not to award the trademark to Grabowsky, he would have six months to respond¨Cpossibly longer than that, if he strings out the process. 
Ford says that on paper, Trump would have an advantage in any trademark dispute given his fame, which gives him ¡°a kind of superpower.¡± But if others file for the trademark before Trump can do so, it will make it that much more difficult for Trump to claim it. That could cost Trump valuable time spent on promoting his new network, as well as getting cable and satellite providers to carry it. 
So when all is said and done, one of the richest men in the world may have had his latest venture axed because he was slow on the draw to get the trademark locked up. That would be more than fitting, given how anemic Trump¡¯s campaign has been at actually selling itself to voters. The cratering of Trump¡¯s brand may have already started.

It is amazing how Trump Jr., known for his rich boy attitude, would suddenly feel the need to get out and help push a stalled car while campaigning in, the now swing state, Arizona . 
Of course, he didn¡¯t leave without a photo op or video footage being recorded. Tyler Bower, the Maricopa County Republican Party Chairman, posted the footage on Twitter and told the Arizona Republic : ¡°She was just stunned. She was taken aback.¡± This is why I'm voting Trump! @DonaldJTrumpJr helping push a ladies car off the road in 101 degree heat in Arizona after a rally today #MAGA pic.twitter.com/ngp1ZhS8Wm

Even the woman who Trump Jr. helped was extremely surprised that any politician would stop to push a car to the side of the road. And seeing as Arizona has been stampeded by Republican rallies this season, it¡¯s a little hard to believe this just happened to take place in Arizona. AZCentral talked about Trump¡¯s presence in the swing state stating : ¡°Donald Trump, whose grip on Arizona¡¯s 11 electoral votes appears to be in jeopardy, will appear in downtown Phoenix for a Saturday rally, his seventh Arizona event this election season.¡± 
Arizona, a historically red state through and through, has now been determined as a swing state for the 2016 election season. Arizona residents began evening out their party preference when Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, started making insane remarks about building walls to keep out immigrants and having Mexico pay for it. We are sure his tasteless conversations and sexual assault allegations didn¡¯t help the situation at all. 
Arizona being a border state is no stranger to immigrant issues, but even with Trump¡¯s hardcore attack on border patrol, Arizona residents still think he is a little hard to swallow. A collaborated effort between The Arizona Republic , Morrison Institute For Public Policy , and The Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication resulted in a poll showing Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton pulling ahead of Trump in the election. Data from Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News poll from Oct.10-15,2016 
If Arizona votes for Hillary Clinton it will be the second non-red candidate that Arizona has ever voted for, the last being Mrs. Clinton¡¯s husband, Bill Clinton in 1996. 
Though Trump Jr. made an interesting choice when showing his caring side, we still don¡¯t think it will help his dad win over, what should have been, one of the easiest states for the Trump campaign to snag.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has a few problems when it comes to Black voters. To look at the polls, you¡¯d wonder if there is a single Black person in the entire country who is willing to give him the time of the day. They do show up, of course. Sure, sometimes they turn out to be ex-cult members turned jazz singing GOP fanatics . Sure, sometimes they are faded celebrities who accidentally use the ¡®N¡¯ word on stage. But you know, sometimes it¡¯s a Marine or Navy serviceman who has somehow managed to look past the debase insults , juvenile tantrums , and transparent lies of the GOP¡¯s great orange hope. 
It¡¯s such a damn shame that Trump can¡¯t tell one group from another. They All Look The Same To Trump 
His recent attempts at rebooting his campaign¡¯s standing with Black people was something of a fiasco . It failed in part because it¡¯s way too late for Trump to distance himself from close ties to White supremacy and antisemitism . 
But it also failed because his image of the lives of Black people is that it is one of nasty, brutish, Dickensian squalor. Indeed, it¡¯s so out of touch-offensive that even his plans to help struggling Black communities come across as being unforgivably racist. 
It¡¯s little wonder, then, that when Trump saw a black face at his rally in Kinston, North Carolina, his razor-sharp mind kicked in. He jumped to the kind of conclusion you¡¯d expect from a man with less racial sensitivity than a 19th century British naval officer. 
He assumed the man was a protester. Different Strokes Of The Pen 
Sixty-three-year-old ex-Marine C.J. Cary was on a mission. Though a die-hard Republican, he had been deeply shocked by some of the things Trump has said. In an effort to reason with him, he penned a letter that, according to the Charlette Observer : ¡°¡­ [Urged] Trump to be less offensive and more inclusive to four demographic groups: black people, women, people with disabilities and college students.¡± 
He never got to deliver the note. 
He made his way toward the front rows shouting ¡°Donald¡± and waving his document, trying to attract the nominees attention. It worked. Sort of. ¡°We have a protester!¡± Trump told the crowd, adding : ¡°By the way,were you paid $1,500 to be a thug?¡± Trump calls black supporter a ""thug,"" has him kicked out of a rally in North Carolina. https://t.co/b4gkI6qx9v pic.twitter.com/eJKuu0CLRi

As the long time Republican voter was escorted from the venue he made one final attempt to get his note to the man who would be king : ¡°I said, ¡®I was trying to get to this doc to Mr. Donald ¡­ will you get this to Donald?¡¯¡± 
The official promised he would pass along the note. Having been treated to some common courtesy at last, Cary set off back home to watch the election coverage with that same horrified expression that we¡¯ve all become so accustomed to. 
By the way, this wasn¡¯t the first time a Trump supporter has been mistaken for a protester simply because he wasn¡¯t the right color:

It is absolutely incredible that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is still trying to deny his sexual misconduct. 
First the man brags about grabbing women and kissing them without consent, then he acts completely outraged that anyone would ever accuse him of doing just that. As a literal parade of women have come forward, one after another, to accuse the candidate of grabbing them, he has responded by threatening to sue them. 
It is hard to believe that anyone would believe Trump¡¯s shallow denials, but if there is anyone out there who still needs convincing, here you go . 
A video has surfaced from 2011 showing Donald J. Trump publicly humiliating a beauty pageant contestant with sexual jokes at her expense and an unwanted grope in front of thousands of corporate audience members. 
Not only did Trump embarrass the woman and grab her in public, he did it out of a very twisted desire for revenge. 
The need for revenge moves Trump¡¯s misogyny out of the realm of the creepy and into the realm of the truly sick. 
Here¡¯s what happened, according to reports . 
Trump was speaking to a corporate audience in Sydney, Australia in 2011. As he often does in his corporate speeches, Trump talked about getting revenge on those who have slighted him. He said: ¡°Get even with people. If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that.¡± 
What a prince. 
He went on to give the crowd an example of how he gets even. He decided to single out a woman named Jennifer Hawkins. She was the 2004 winner of the Miss Universe Pageant, which Trump owned. He had asked the beauty queen, who is Australian, to introduce him at the corporate event, but there had been some type of miscommunication. 
Either that, or she had simply declined to do so. 
Either way, Trump was furious at Ms. Hawkins. He wanted the crowd to see how he handled his anger at a perceived snub. As he talked about getting revenge, he said : ¡°I¡¯ll give you an example: Jennifer Hawkins. Where¡¯s Jennifer? Where¡¯s she sitting? Get over here, Jennifer. First of all, how beautiful is Jennifer? This is about getting even.¡± Trump pulled Hawkins up on the stage, telling the crowd how angry he had been at her. When she tried to explain herself, Trump pulled the mic away from her and told the crowd how she had ¡°dissed¡± him after he had made her a ¡°big star¡± through his pageant. He disregarded her attempts to explain, instead choosing to make a sexual joke of her. ¡°So what happens is ¨D and you know what? She came tonight, she came ¨D came, she came, she came.¡± When the audience dutifully laughed at Ms. Hawkins¡¯ expense, Trump added: ¡°See, so they have the same filthy minds in Australia.¡± Oh, ha,ha. What a sick adolescent mind. What an ass. It got worse, though. Trump grabbed the embarrassed woman and pulled her in for a clearly unwanted kiss. She managed to get an arm in between them, but Trump still managed to kiss her cheek. This is all on video, folks. This is right there for everyone to see. The disgusting sexual pervert who wants to be our next President can¡¯t dismiss this one with a threat to sue. He can¡¯t pretend that it didn¡¯t happen. Because we can all watch it. Right here .

For weeks,   nominee Donald Trump has been whining that the election is being ¡°rigged¡± against him. He even called the presidential debates ¡°rigged.¡± 
Now, I guess his ego is so YUGE because he wants the election cancelled, and the presidency awarded to him without voting. 
He said at a rally in Toledo, Ohio Thursday: ¡°And just thinking to myself right now, we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right? What are we even having it for? What are we having it for? ¡®Her policies are so bad. Boy, do we have a big difference.¡± 
He¡¯s against voter fraud, but he¡¯s OK with just yanking the election away from us? That is insane. That is not how a democratic election works, Trumpy. Taking the vote away from the people like that would make Trump our first dictator. 
Trump may have been trying to make a joke out of it, but with his talk of rigged elections, that comment is just plain scary. 
On Thursday, Trump appeared on Bill O¡¯ Reilly¡¯s show. When asked if the polls would be rigged on election day, Trump said he believes they will be. When asked about his trailing in the national polls, Trump said : ¡°I¡¯m winning in certain polls and then in other polls, the dirty polls we call them, I was losing by numbers that were ridiculous. I think we¡¯re winning, but Bill, you look at some of these polls it¡¯s absolutely ridiculous.¡± 
Just last week, Trump¡¯s poor Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway was faced with the undesirable job of defending Trump¡¯s idiocy. After one of the other times he whined about the election being rigged, she said : ¡°His entire campaign is built about the little guy being the victim, the forgotten man and forgotten woman being the victim of the rigged corrupt system. Let¡¯s keep the focus there. That¡¯s who he¡¯s fighting for. I know so many in the media like to just dismiss the crowd sizes. Let me tell you something, you go out on the road with Donald Trump, this election doesn¡¯t feel over.¡± 
When he refers to himself in the third person, it makes him sound even creepier.

Donald Trump doesn¡¯t have a sense of humor. While he may smile from time to time, it always seems forced, as if he¡¯s afraid his face will crack if he smiles too broadly. And now he¡¯s whining yet again about Alec Baldwin¡¯s brilliant portrayal of him on Saturday Night Live. 
As part of an interview with AJ Calloway of Extra , Trump had this to say about the way Baldwin plays him: ¡°Well, I think I¡¯m a much nicer guy than he¡¯s portraying. He¡¯s portraying someone who¡¯s very mean and nasty, and I¡¯m not mean and nasty. I think I¡¯m a much nicer person than he¡¯s portraying, so I think it¡¯s an inaccurate portrayal of me.¡± 
Clearly, in addition to Trump not having a sense of humor, he also is deficient in the self-awareness department. 
Would the Donald ever do SNL again? Not a chance, he declared: ¡°They want me to go back. No, I¡¯m not interested in going back¡­They¡¯re making me out to be a very mean, bad kind of a guy and that¡¯s not me.¡± 
Trump was also asked about the fact that NBC had fired Billy Bush due to the leaked videotape in which Trump said he likes to grab women ¡°by the pussy¡± and kiss them against their will. The GOP nominee cryptically responded that ¡°they did it to him,¡± but would not elaborate on who ¡°they¡± might be. He then added : ¡°I have always liked Billy, but I have not [spoken to him]¡­but I always found Billy to be a good guy.¡± 
Yeah, a good guy who laughed when you brazenly talked about how you get off on sexually assaulting women because you happen to be wealthy and famous. 
Face it, Donald, you¡¯re a pig. And to make matters worse, you can¡¯t even laugh at yourself.

Ever since the public opinion polls began showing him behind in the 2016 race for the White House, GOP nominee Donald Trump has alleged that the political system and election is ¡°rigged.¡± He has even recommended that his supporters show up at polling places to observe what is taking place and assure the election isn¡¯t ¡°stolen¡± via voter fraud. 
Which brings us to Thursday in Des Moines, Iowa. Terri Lynn Rote voted early at an election office in her hometown. A few hours later, Rote then went to another polling location and attempted to vote a second time. She was arrested and charged with first-degree election fraud, a Class D felony. 
The irony is almost too much to stomach, isn¡¯t it? 
Polk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald said it¡¯s the first time in 12 years he can remember ever having to report potential voter fraud to the authorities. 
What Trump and other Republicans fail to say when they warn of voter fraud on the left is that based on the demographics of the American electorate, there is no need for Democrats to try and commit fraud when it comes to a national election. In fact, it is far more likely that the GOP will have to try to cheat or intimidate voters (with restrictive voter ID provisions and by cutting back the number of polling places or early voting days) in order to remain competitive. 
It should also be noted that when Trump was winning in the Republican primaries, you never once heard him scream about anyone trying to cheat or rig an election. It was only after his own numbers began to slip and he found himself behind by as much at 14 points to Hillary Clinton that such talk began. 
So, Donald, what say you about the election being rigged in light of Terri Rote? Donald? Hmm¡­guess that silence tells us all we need to know. 
Here¡¯s the Donald alleging that the election is rigged against him:

At this point in the election run-up, we know an awful lot about Republican candidate Donald Trump ¨C probably more than we want to. 
But there¡¯s one thing about him that has puzzled a lot of people ¨C his use of the word ¡®bigly.¡¯ 
What the heck does it mean? Is he trying to use it as you¡¯d use a word such as ¡®largely¡¯ or ¡®finally¡¯? Would the opposite of ¡®bigly¡¯ be ¡®littlely¡¯? Is his grasp of the English language really that bad? 
He has used it a lot in his campaign speeches, and it has even been transcribed and reported at times as ¡®bigly.¡¯ Some people have decided he¡¯s actually saying ¡®big league.¡¯ Others aren¡¯t so sure. 
It turns out that it¡¯s not his vocabulary that¡¯s at fault, it¡¯s his pronunciation. 
Raymond Navarro of Catholic broadcaster EWTN asked him directly in an interview this week if he¡¯s saying ¡®bigly¡¯ or ¡®big league.¡¯ Trump responded : ¡°I use big league.¡± 
You can see the exchange on 25:05 in this video clip from the interview. 
The fact that he¡¯s saying ¡®big league¡¯ was also affirmed by his son Donald Trump Jr. who was asked about it after the September 26 presidential debate. 
So now the mystery is over. But not before broadcast and social media had a lot of bigly fun with it. Watch this funny clip from Bloomberg, which was made before the truth was revealed. It contains all the bigly/big league confusion you can handle.

The latest ¡°revelation¡± from the FBI just gets more and more curious by the hour. Now we have audio of Lara Trump, wife of Eric Trump and daughter-in-law of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, saying she believes her father-in-law was behind the latest letter from FBI Director James Comey. Lara Trump: ¡®My Father-In-Law Forced Their Hand¡¯ 
In an interview on WABC Radio with Rita Cosby, Lara Trump came right out and said, proudly, that she believes Donald Trump was one of the people behind this whole thing: ¡°I think my father-in-law forced their hand in this. You know, he has been the one since the beginning saying that she shouldn¡¯t be able to run for president, and I commend him on that.¡± 
Anyone who has been paying attention over the past 12 hours or so knows that this ¡°scandal¡± died before it even had a chance to really breathe. The conservative media has, of course, attempted to spin this into something real, given the fact that their candidate¡¯s chances of winning are less than 10 percent. But the emails are not from Clinton nor are they from Clinton¡¯s server. Not only that, but Comey¡¯s motivations behind sending the letter seem more and more likely to be politically motivated. Former DOJ Official: ¡®You Don¡¯t Do This¡¯ 
Comey¡¯s actions are unprecedented for an FBI Director. In a piece discussing that very fact, Jane Mayer wrote for The New Yorker : ¡°¡­ His latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities, who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the Presidential and congressional elections. ¡®You don¡¯t do this,¡¯ one former senior Justice Department official exclaimed. ¡®It¡¯s aberrational. It violates decades of practice.¡¯ The reason, according to the former official, who asked not to be identified because of ongoing cases involving the department, ¡®is because it impugns the integrity and reputation of the candidate, even though there¡¯s no finding by a court, or in this instance even an indictment.'¡± There was also the tweetstorm from former DOJ spokesperson Matthew Miller, in which he eviscerated Comey¡¯s actions. He also wrote a more cohesive piece for the Washington Post , in which he said : ¡°With each step, Comey moved further away from department guidelines and precedents, culminating in Friday¡¯s letter to Congress. This letter not only violated Justice rules on commenting on ongoing investigations but also flew in the face of years of precedent about how to handle sensitive cases as Election Day nears.¡± All of this makes one wonder ¨C what is Comey¡¯s motivation here? Comey, a Republican appointed by President Obama, is breaking rules of tradition left and right. And Trump¡¯s own daughter-in-law is on record saying that she believes the Republican nominee ¡°forced their hand.¡± No matter the motivation, the ¡°scandal¡± is dead in the water, no matter how much the Republicans and the Trump campaign wish it were truly the ¡°October surprise¡± they¡¯ve been waiting for ¡­ rather than another woman coming forward and accusing their nominee of sexual assault. That number stands at 12 and counting. The Clinton campaign, to their credit, is calling for complete transparency from the FBI in the matter.

In an interview with POLITICO, Gingrich said : ¡°The challenge for everybody¡¯s going to be, ¡®What if he gets 48 or 49 percent?¡¯ And what if he says: ¡®You know, I like this campaign and stuff. I ain¡¯t leaving¡¯? There will then be a Trump Party.¡± 
It looks like the Republicans are already planning to obstruct Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton if she gets elected. Gingrich said : ¡°I think it¡¯ll be very difficult for the country ¡­ I think their message to the Republican leadership will be, ¡®You had better prepare to fight her every single day.¡¯¡± 
Trump broached the subject at a rally in Sanford, Florida. He said that this election is the party¡¯s ¡°last chance.¡± 
The Trumpkin proclaimed : ¡°Republicans have to finally get smart and come together. This is our last chance. This is bigger than me or any of us. It¡¯s about our country. This is about ending Obamacare. This is about the Supreme Court. This is about rebuilding our military and taking care of our vets, strengthening our borders and keeping our companies and jobs from leaving our beloved country. This is about restoring the rule of law, saving our Constitution and keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.¡± 
It¡¯s funny that he¡¯s talking about party unity when he spreads divisive, hateful rhetoric, and has for the last year-and-a-half that has split the Republican Party. It became especially bad after the infamous Access Hollywood audio leaked. He has done his best to alienate just about every group out there over the course of his campaign. Hopefully, he will lose to a Hillary Clinton landslide on November 8. Vote Blue!

But do his claims stand up to reality? Trump Charitable Donations? Almost Nothing 
The Washington Post published a piece this afternoon stating that they¡¯ve been researching Trump¡¯s claims for months and have come up nearly empty-handed. 
According to the Post : ¡°After calling 420-plus charities with some connection to Trump, The Post found only one personal gift from Trump between 2008 and the spring of this year. That was a gift to the Police Athletic League of New York City , in 2009. It was worth less than $10,000.¡± 
The article goes on to mention Trump¡¯s self-inflating talk and random appearances at charitable events with which he has no monetary connection. Many of those involved with the charities have felt swindled in one way or another by the Republican nominee over the years. 
It tells the story of a woman, employed by Trump, who asked him to help sponsor a gala for the Professional Women in Construction, where she was being honored. He didn¡¯t, spent $100 on a single ticket, and then took over the microphone at the event for 15 minutes to make himself look like a big donor. 
There¡¯s the story of the time when he was ¡°principal for a day¡± at a poor school in the Bronx. He gave them a phony $1 million bill. He did manage to fork over $200 before taking off in his limo. 
Or the time when he decided to take the stage at an event to benefit children suffering from AIDS. He took the chair designated for someone who actually made a charitable donation (unlike Trump), and then posed for pictures as though he was a donor. The executive director of the charity, Gretchen Buchenholz, sent an email to the person whose chair Trump had commandeered, Steven Fisher, apologizing for Trump¡¯s transgression: ¡°I immediately said ¡®no,¡¯ but Rudy Giuliani said ¡®yes¡¯ and I felt I had to accede to him. I hope you can forgive me.¡± 
Steven Fisher¡¯s chair happened to be right next to Giuliani¡¯s, too. Go figure. Some Things Never Change 
The instances above are only a tiny handful of the stories laid out in the Post article. All the evidence together points to a man who talks a big game about all his various charitable donations, but who, in reality, is as miserly as Ebenezer Scrooge. 
Trump, however, continues to try to portray the image of generosity. 
An archived page for Trump¡¯s corporate website ends his biography with these words: ¡°He is the archetypal businessman ¡ª a deal maker without peer and an ardent philanthropist.¡± 
On October 20, 2016, Trump appeared as a featured speaker at the Al Smith charity dinner alongside his rival, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Despite all that we know now, despite all the questions that have been raised since he began his campaign about his charitable donations (or lack thereof), his biography in the program at the dinner contained those exact same words. 
Trump lives in a bubble. And that bubble needs to burst.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made a fool out of himself at and after the Democratic National Convention. Trump got into a feud with the Khan family, a Gold Star family who spoke about him. 
Trump apparently didn¡¯t know what a Gold Star family is. This term is generally used to describe families who have lost a loved one in the military. 
Paul Manafort, former advisor to George H.W. Bush¡¯s, Gerald Ford¡¯s, and Bob Dole¡¯s presidential campaigns, became an advisor for the Donald Trump campaign during the general election season. His plan was for Trump to go low profile, so the media would then focus on his rival, Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. 
Manafort was mad when Trump went after the Khan family instead of focusing on the issues. He said: ¡°The election is about the American people, it¡¯s not about you.¡± 
Now that we have less than two weeks until the election, Trump wants to rehash some of his craziest feuds. Trump said that if he were president Humayun Khan would still be alive. Khizr said : ¡°This is the most cruel thing you can say to grieving parents, that if I was there this would not have happened. There¡¯s no sincerity in those remarks ¡­ This is one character that a leader must have to be the leader of a great country, to be the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the United States: empathy. And this person totally lacks that.¡± 
Khan is now joining Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail. 
Check out the campaign ad he made for the Clinton campaign:

Trump has made it clear that not even committing sexual assault would make him withdraw from the election. 
This latest video is one of many being unearthed, including one in which he said he¡¯d be dating a ten-year-old girl in another ten years. But this isn¡¯t the first time he¡¯s made sexual comments about Ivanka: ¡°If I weren¡¯t happily married and, ya know, her father¡­¡± 
The latest tape shows the father and daughter duo appearing on an episode of the Wendy Williams Show back in 2013. During a segment called Fave 5, Wendy asked what their favorite thing to bond over was. 
Ivanka gave an eloquent response: ¡°Either real estate and golf.¡± 
Her father¡¯s, who is currently holding rallies in swing states while continuing to claim the election is rigged, had less to do with career and sports and more to do with his objectification of women: ¡°Well I was gonna say sex, but¡­¡± 
There¡¯s also a video from 1994 in which Trump sexualized his other daughter, Tiffany Trump , when she was a one-year-old. Tiffany is the only child between him and his second wife, Marla Maples . ¡°Well, I think that she¡¯s got a lot of Marla, she¡¯s a really beautiful baby, and she¡¯s got Marla¡¯s legs. We don¡¯t know yet if she¡¯s got this part yet.¡± 
As he said that, Trump then held his hands to his chest and suggested breasts. That wasn¡¯t the only cringe-worthy moment pertaining to him and Tiffany, though.

For months, Donald Trump has assuring his supporters that he is going to win on November 8. This is despite nearly every poll showing him behind by as much as 12 points. And now we have an inside look at the Trump campaign which would seem to indicate that the entire campaign apparatus is on the verge of collapsing on itself. 
New York magazine has just published an article by Gabriel Sherman in which one Trump staffer commented: ¡°Think of the bunker right before Hitler killed himself. Donald¡¯s in denial. They¡¯re all in denial.¡± 
Overall, the mood of the staff working out of Trump Tower goes from gloom, denial, rage, and glee on Friday when the FBI reported it would review new materials in the investigation of Hillary Clinton¡¯s use of a private email server while she was still Secretary of State. 
While the Trump camp should be able to make hay of the announcement from FBI Director James Comey, one problem remains: The candidate is so undisciplined that any progress made is quickly undone by Trump himself. As a top donor told Sherman : ¡°Trump has the following personality: NIH-NFW, meaning ¡®If it¡¯s not invented here, not invented behind these eyes, then it¡¯s no fucking way.'¡± 
Sherman¡¯s report echoes another article from the New York Times in which an advisor to the GOP nominee commented: ¡°In Trumpworld as Hitler¡¯s Bunker terms (it¡¯s) like when Goebbels thought FDR¡¯s death would save the Nazi regime.¡± 
And plans for what comes after the election¨Crumors of a new Trump TV network¨Calso seem unlikely some inside the inner circle reveal. One prominent member of the GOP told Sherman: ¡°It¡¯s too expensive. Trump won¡¯t put his own money in.¡± 
Disgraced former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes has parted ways with Trump, reportedly because the candidate refused to stay on message and follow direction from campaign staff. Others are also positioning themselves for what happens after the election is over with. One former Mitt Romney staffer says the lifeboats are out early: ¡°It¡¯s a window into a campaign in a downward spiral when the positioning begins, but I¡¯ve never seen it begin this early.¡± 
So was the entire Trump campaign nothing more than ego fulfillment and an attempt to gain endless media attention for the Donald? With nine days left, that explanation seems to be the most likely reason Trump embarked on this suicide mission in the first place.

Dear GOP Presidential Candidate Donald Trump, 
I just watched a portion of your interview from Sunday night and I was appalled. You seriously need to be put over someone¡¯s knee. 
You are running for the highest leadership position in this country and you are carrying on like a spoiled little toddler, stomping your feet and throwing temper tantrums and hollering all over social media. Hollering things like ¡°Stop calling me names!¡±¡°I hate you!¡±¡°You¡¯re being mean to me!¡±¡°I¡¯m telling my mommy!¡± are not things that an adult man does ¨C those are things that a toddler does. 
Here is a prime example : ¡°In what is now a familiar pattern, Donald Trump took to Twitter following his interview in order to trash the interviewer and whine about how the questions were supposedly stacked against him.¡± 
Guess what? Running this country is HARD. It isn¡¯t for whiners. Not once have I heard President Obama whine about you running him through the ringer about his birth certificate. Not once have I heard him whine when people in public office have disrespected him. Not once have I heard him whine when Congress has voted against his programs simply because he is a black man and they don¡¯t like him. Not once in almost seven years has that man whined that Fox News has said something bad about him. Not once. Let that sink in. 
I ain¡¯t your mommy, but I am a mom. Nothing more ¨C Just A Mom. I have a normal kid. But for a few minutes here I¡¯m going to pretend you¡¯re my son because you really seem to need a mom¡¯s advice. When my kid has a temper tantrum, she gets sent to her room. When she can talk calmly to adults, she is allowed to come out and we discuss what she did wrong. 
I¡¯m thinking that maybe no one ever did that for you. No one ever said ¡°No¡± to you. You never got a spanking, literally or figuratively. 
You are acting like an insufferable ass. The United States is not a dictatorship. It is not a corporation that you can run into the ground and file bankruptcy on. It is a democratic government that is set up with three distinct branches of government. Those three branches of government are designed to act with a series of checks and balances to ensure that no one person has the authority or the ability to make horrid decisions, treat people in a sucky way, and waste our tax dollars on frivolities. 
Here is a link to a children¡¯s website , where they spell it out at a level that even you should be able to comprehend. 
By saying ¡° We¡¯ll see ¡° every time the interviewer reminded you of this system of checks and balances you displayed your ignorance of how our government works. My 12-year-old knows more about government than you appear to. 
This is not a media circus for you to use to continue pumping hot air into the atmosphere. Global climate change is already a problem and your constant bloviating is causing more detrimental effects than the farting cows. Stop treating this campaign like your very own little playground. It isn¡¯t. Our government is a democracy ¨C that means that if hell freezes over and you do somehow manage to gain the presidency you work for us, the people of this country. 
Here¡¯s a thought ¨C instead of building a wall that will cost billions, why don¡¯t you propose an amnesty program that could be enacted for a couple million? The sheer cost of deporting millions of people, only to turn around and let them back in ¡®legally¡¯ is an astronomical burden to place on already over-burdened tax payers. It is also the DUMBEST idea I have ever heard. Does having all that money remove any shred of common sense? Do you possess any ability to think reasonably? 
You would be amazed at how many cost-cutting things can be enacted if you think about them and come up with common sense solutions. The end goal is what you want to accomplish. 
Since your fellow Republicans are going to be the biggest stopping block on any type of an amnesty program ¨C sell them on what they stand to GAIN from doing this as opposed to booting everyone out and building an asinine wall. 
You can¡¯t just think about ¡°The Donald¡± and how he feels about things. You have to consider each and every person in this country. You have to take our tax dollars and use them in the best way possible to make life better for us. This isn¡¯t all about you. You¡¯re just a potty-mouthed little boy that needs a bar of soap to wash your mouth out and a time-out to reflect on your actions lately. 
You can¡¯t act like a spoiled little toddler if you expect to be taken seriously as a GOP presidential candidate. You need to stop that silliness right now. Get your head out of your ass and look around. You have no clue how to run a government. If you want to continue acting like a toddler, no one will ever take you seriously. The voters in this country will not subject themselves to being ruled by a spoiled brat. 
Grow up, Donald.",english,2016-10-30T19:22:16.129+02:00,liberalamerica.org,US,30230,Comment on GOP Presidential Candidate Trump ¨C You Need A Spanking! by para kazanmak,0,http://portal.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/images-12.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Allow me to be the voice of reason and sanity amidst a storm of doubt, recrimination, and uncertainty. Yes, Donald Trump has narrowed the margin since the news from FBI Director James Comey on Friday that information ¡°pertinent¡± to the matter of Hillary Clinton¡¯s email server had been found on a device belonging to disgraced Congressman and sexting freak Anthony Weiner, but it¡¯s time to look beyond the superficial statistics and dive a bit deeper into the real math which wins Presidential elections. 
The ABC News/Washington Post national tracking poll shows Trump within 1 point of Hillary Clinton in a four-way race that includes Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein. Last week, that same poll had Clinton up nationally by 12 points. Oh my gosh! She lost 11 points in a single week? No. That¡¯s nearly impossible to have happened, which means there is a better than 99 percent chance it hasn¡¯t. 
Also, one does not win a Presidential election on the national level. Such races are won on a state-by-state basis and then electoral votes are awarded to whatever candidate wins a particular state. In other words, the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is 50 individual state races which will determine who the next occupant of the Oval Office will be. 
So, if we look at the aggregate polling data¨Ci.e. data from many polls¨Cwe see that based on that information the HuffPost Pollster model shows Clinton leading by 7 points in a two-way race and 6 points when third party candidates are included . 
OK, you can breathe now. 
Also, despite the recent fluctuations in national polls, there remains virtually no discernible path by which Trump can get the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. Now this isn¡¯t to say that we can all just sit back and expect others to do our voting for us. All of us¨Cliberals, progressives, moderates, the rational and sane who do not want to give a psychopath nuclear weapons¨Chave to get out and vote for Clinton if we value our future and those of our families. 
Thanks once again to the good folks at the Huffington Post, we can clearly see that Hillary Clinton now has a 98 percent chance of being the next President of the United States. 
Whew! Feeling much better now. 
Are you kidding me?! Get up off your duff and go vote! This is no time for complacency! The fate of this country and the entire world is at stake. 
So don¡¯t fret, but DO VOTE!

Even though the Trump campaign tries desperately to deny that many of their supporters are racist jackasses, the actions of some acolytes who support the GOP nominee continue to prove otherwise. 
Take for example a man at a Trump campaign rally held in Phoenix on Saturday. This enraged man began taunting members of the media with chants of ¡°Jew S. A.¡± in place of USA. This same rabid moron also accused members of the press who were simply doing their jobs of being ¡°the enemy¡± and ¡°working for the devil.¡± So this just happened near the press pen at Trump's Phoenix rally.

¡ª Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) October 29, 2016 
For his part, Trump riled up his rally filled with deplorables by telling them : ¡°When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope. They stop dreaming. They stop trying. Hillary Clinton¡¯s corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation and it must be stopped.¡± 
What is both maddening and simultaneously pathetic is that many of these enraged Trump voters are losers who need someone to blame their own inadequacies on. They are often poorly educated and have low-paying jobs. But then again, if you fail to educate yourself or prepare for the job market by learning a trade or getting a degree, that is at least in part your own fault. But to try and direct your anger at others¨Cbe they African-Americans, Hispanics, or women¨Conly proves your own impotence. Rather than facing their failures and trying to better themselves, these narcissistic simpletons choose to hate those who set goals and accomplish them. 
The type of Trump supporter who shouted at members of the media in Phoenix cannot face one simple fact: He or she has a made a mess of their life and the pain is too much to take. Therefore they lash out at others with hatred and bile. They cannot face one simple fact: Their time has passed and the future has caught up with them, just as it will catch up with Donald Trump on November 8.

When historians write accounts of the 2016 race for the White House, it¡¯s very likely that one of the things which will get special attention is the level of violence¨Cboth physical and verbal¨Cwhich has emanated from those who slavishly support GOP nominee Donald Trump. 
If you doubt this fact, consider what was said earlier today at a Trump rally being held in Las Vegas. Author and self-described ¡°capitalist evangelist¡± Wayne Allyn Root was giving a rambling speech as a warm-up before Der Fuhrer Donald took the stage, and while portions of it were comparable to the rantings of Charles Manson after too much caffeine, it was the language Root used (highly militaristic and warlike) that you cannot help but notice. At various points in his unhinged diatribe, Root used the following phrases : ¡°Trump warriors¡± ¡°Trump army¡± ¡°Trump revolution¡± 
Then, in full psychotic rant, Root attempted to mix together plot elements from the O.J. Simpson case with the movies Driving Miss Daisy and Thelma and Louise , telling the ecstatic crowd : ¡°It¡¯s Hillary in a White Ford Bronco. She¡¯s got Huma driving and they¡¯re headed for the Mexican border. I have a name for the future TV movie. It¡¯s called Driving Miss Hillary. And the ending, if we all get our wish, is like Thelma and Louise!¡± 
Finally, Root ended his echo of Nuremberg by declaring: ¡°I will give you my country when you pry it from my cold dead hands.¡± 
When I listen to Wayne Allyn Root (or any of the other fanatical Trumpkins), the movie that comes to mind for me is One Flew Over the Cuckoo¡¯s Nest.

Did Walsh mean to imply violence? That is certainly how the media is portraying it, as his comments spark controversy and fuel fire to the debate over the nearing election.
The irony that his commentary drew from the imagery of founding-era patriots who stood up to tyranny was deeply lost on the left, who see opponents to Hillary in black and white terms ¨C racist, xenophobic, utterly deplorable and inherently violent.
CNN followed up, asking Walsh what he meant by statement.
via CNN :
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
[¡­] Walsh ¡­ did respond to CNN¡¯s Jake Tapper via Twitter when he asked: ¡°What exactly does that mean?¡±
¡°It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back,¡± he responded to Tapper. 
@jaketapper It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back.

After a firestorm on social media, Walsh doubled down, stating on Twitter:
I¡¯m serious. I don¡¯t think a musket would do much good these days, but it¡¯s time for civil disobedience on the right. https://t.co/ThJPEbALWZ 
¡ª Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 

His heated rhetoric is a response to the endless episodes of fraud, dirty trick and foul play by the Hillary campaign, as it seems that she will stop at nothing to become the first female POTUS ¨C just the sort of abuse of power that the founders warned about.
1775-76 erupted in response to a long train of abuses ¨C acts of oppression and hostility listed in the Declaration of Independence that is being largely repeated in modern day America.
Could Hillary¡¯s reported election victory ¨C or Donald Trump¡¯s defeat ¨C signal civil unrest and a new wave of resistance, particularly if the results are widely viewed as fraudulent or ¡°rigged¡±? Trump, for one, has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election.
The scenario is plausible enough that the Pentagon and Homeland Security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest.
As SHTF detailed in an exclusive report, a whistleblower has come forward on the ominous contingency plan to keep and/or restore order if the populace revolt against the establishment¡¯s ¡°selection¡± for president:
If there is any truth to it, the 2016 election could be a kick-off for total tyranny.
According to an unnamed source ¨C who has provided accurate intel in the past ¨C an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after.
Date: October 30th ¨C 30 days after the election
Suspected Region: Northeast, specifically New York
1st Phase: NROL (No Rule of Law) ¨C drill involving combat arms in metro areas (active and reserve). Source says active duty and reserve service members are being vaccinated as if they are being deployed in theatre.
2nd Phase: LROL (Limited Rule of Law) ¨C Military/FEMA consolidating resources, controlling water supply, handing out to public as needed.
3rd Phase: AROL (Authoritarian Rule of Law) ¨C Possible new acronym or term for ¡°Martial Law¡±. Curfew, restricted movements, basically martial law scenario.
Source said exercise involves FEMA/DHS/Military
At this point, no one can say for certain what will happen in the aftermath of November 8, but it is clear that millions and millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the status quo, troubled about the economic realities perpetuated by the Fed and angry that Hillary may be put in the Oval Office rather than a jail cell, despite a trail of corruption with virtually no end.
How far will things go?
And will things ever be reset without a new American Revolution?

That depends on what the definition of ¡°is¡± is ¨C and whether or not you count blatant media bias, operatives and instigators, shady quasi-voters, bizarre electronic voting ¡°errors¡± and a heavy-handed advantage in the electoral college and the shifting demographics of a socialist state that promises much to certain groups.
With the GOP leadership turning its back on Trump, and the Democratic machine dedicated solely to providing for Her, it will be a difficult win for Trump, despite overwhelming enthusiasm at rallies across the entire country and lop-sided pro-Trump crowds that literally dwarf pro-Hillary gatherings of very few.
But as most everyone knows by now, it isn¡¯t the popular vote that counts ¨C but only the delegates awarded state-by-state to the electoral college¡­ and that is a game that Hillary¡¯s operatives are very good at playing.
Daily News Brief: The 2016 Election Is In The Process Of Being Stolen With Rigged Voting Machines 

There are several states ¨C in particular ¨C that are being surprisingly maneuvered for her advantage¡­ and if successful, will block Trump from even coming close the presidency.
Texas Could Turn ¡°Blue¡± For the First Time In 20 Years
This is the big enchilada, so to speak. For the first time in many decades, Texas is in play for Hillary and the Democrats. Texas has been as solidly ¡°red¡± as any state in the union, but 2016 could be different.
With 38 electoral votes, the Lone Star State is the biggest prize on the map next to California, whose 55 electoral votes have gone to the Democrats since before history began. Since at least 2008, the Dems have been massaging their electioneering strategy to capitalize on shifting demographics ¨C with plenty of Hispanics in the next generation of voters. On paper, Hillary should be able to play well to Hispanics with all the controversy over Trump¡¯s immigration stances and talk of a border wall. Rumors of illegal immigrants be encouraged to vote could be a crucial factor, with polls in Texas close to neck and neck¡­ it could go either way.

Of course, there is every reason to think that Team Hillary is not taking any chances.
As Michael Snyder and many others have reported , electronic voting machines have been mysteriously flipping votes for Hillary in several counties in Texas¡­ and that doesn¡¯t bode well for a massive electoral prize that is within range for her campaign:
Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning.
At least one county is making an emergency switch to paper ballots after irregularities were found with the electronic machines during early voting.
Meanwhile, Infowars confronted the head of Texas¡¯ elections about his decision to violate voter laws and abandon a manual count of a random sampling of 1-3% of votes (which should theoretically reflect the larger voting trend, unless something is fishy). Without that count, there is less accountability than ever:

This is major issue, and Texas isn¡¯t the only state¡­ just the biggest.
2. Utah¡¯s Independent Republican Could Actually Beat Trump 
OK, so Utah only has a grand total of 6 electoral college votes¡­ and has never been a decisive swing state in a presidential election. But that is because the state has been so solidly ¡°red.¡± However, this election is totally different.
A little known independent candidate named Evan McMullin has actually taken the lead in several recent polls in Utah, and is neck-and-neck with both Trump and Hillary in several other polls (at or around 30% apiece). Libertarian Gary Johnson is also playing (relatively) well at about 5% ¨C possibly enough to swing further momentum away form Trump.
But Evan McMullin is the real surprise hit ¨C in a state that is suddenly considered an important battleground in the election.

McMullin is a Mormon, which gives him a significant boost. He is officially tied to Better for America, which is basically a #NeverTrump operation ¨C backed by neocons like William Kristol. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Evan McMullin has a pretty colorful and telling background : on top of being a former policy director for House Republicans, he¡¯s also a former CIA operations officer; a member of the elite think tank Council on Foreign Relations (CFR); a former Goldman Sachs investment banker and a volunteer refugee resettlement officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Jordan.
Wow! I wonder if there could be an agenda there. Hillary probably won¡¯t win Utah, but Trump may not either ¨C and it could make a crucial difference if he is within striking distance of 270 electoral votes.
3. Florida Is a Must Win Swing State for Trump¡­ But Current Polls Show Possible Hillary Win 
Oh boy¡­ Florida all over again. With 29 electoral votes, it remains a major contender that is so often on the fence and swinging in the wind. It is considered essential for a Trump victory, and indeed for just about any successful Republican bid for the presidency.
Sure, we all know the polls are rigged, and may be oversampling Dems to look better for Hillary on paper ¨C but nonetheless, that perception drives expectations.
If She can create a convincing win there, it could change the course of the election once again. Florida has consistently been the closest outcome ¨C in 2008 and 2012 it went blue for Obama; in 2000 and 2004 it went red for Bush (and not without major controversy and some very shady recounting).
Her team is pushing heavily for early voting in Florida, and so far they claim an early voting advantage.
But campaign surrogate Roger Stone is now reporting that Hillary has met secretly with Broward County officials in Florida, and there is speculation that problems with the voting machines may soon be happening all over again.

Pay very close to what happens there, because of course, Florida could be THE deciding state (again). Right now polls are within 2 points , currently in favor of Trump by a very narrow margin.
4. Colorado Has Known Voting Fraud Issues ¨C With Dead People on the Voter Rolls 
With 9 electoral votes, Colorado is currently swinging ¡°blue¡± but could go either way. CBS4 and the Washington Times reported that an investigation was started by Colorado¡¯s Secretary of State after multiple examples were found of deceased people registered and in the voter rolls:
¡°This is the kind of thing you hear rumored, joked about in Chicago, that kind of thing,¡± Mr. Maasssaid during a Thursday evening broadcast. ¡°Tonight, that changes. We did find voter fraud in Colorado that essentially waters down your vote.¡± 
[¡­] 
¡°This is the kind of thing you hear rumored, joked about in Chicago, that kind of thing,¡± Mr. Maasssaid during a Thursday evening broadcast. ¡°Tonight, that changes. We did find voter fraud in Colorado that essentially waters down your vote.¡± 
It¡¯s not clear whether or not Colorado could make a difference in the outcome, but the results could prove suspect.
5. Hillary Is ¡°Leading¡± In These Key Swing States 
While Trump is expected to win the crucial state of Ohio, and also North Carolina, Hillary is projected to take key states including Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa, Virginia and Arizona.
According to the Washington Post :
if Clinton can hold Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Colorado, then she only needs one more out of many swing states ¡ª New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina, or Florida ¡ª barring any surprise Trump win in a blue-leaning state like Wisconsin. That is currently looking very plausible. 
While any of these could change in the actual outcome, it shows that Hillary has definitely maneuvered to win where it counts ¨C not with the people, but with the electoral college.
The details are too numerous to follow here, and anything could happen.
6. You Know Voter Fraud Is Happening If the Media Claim It Isn¡¯t 
What should be very telling to everyone is how loudly the major media ¨C in concert ¨C are trying to debunk Trump¡¯s claims of voter fraud and insist that all is well when it is quite clear that there are major issues.

This is one claim that the system is very afraid of, because quite frankly, they have a great deal to hide.
There is more reason than ever for accountability, reporting on any irregularities and an insistence that the will of the people be respected ¨C because the system is desperate to hold onto control at any cost.

Today¡¯s update includes several state category changes that benefit Trump should they play out as projected on election day next Tuesday. 
The following changes are reflected in the new projections. Utah moves from toss up to Trump New Hampshire moves from Clinton to toss up Virginia moves from Clinton to toss up Michigan moves from Clinton to toss up Ohio moves from toss up to Trump 
UTAH 
While long shot candidate Evan McMullin has proven to be a thorn in Trump¡¯s side in Utah, all polls now indicate Trump will end up triumphant on election day. The media is hyping Utah in an attempt to cast a negative light on Trump¡¯s overall standing with more conservative GOP voters, but there is no solid evidence McMullin will actually pull off a win. 
We strongly believe Trump will ultimately win Utah and have moved this state into the Trump corner accordingly. 
NEW HAMPSHIRE 
New polling out of New Hampshire has Trump and Clinton tied, with the latest poll showing Trump at +3. There is no early voting in New Hampshire so we don¡¯t have a sense of where things stand in terms of turnout. 
With no early turnout data and tightening polls we¡¯ve decided to move New Hampshire back into toss up territory. 
VIRGINIA 
Perhaps the most surprising move is Virginia. Of all the states we¡¯re watching in the toss up column, Virginia is probably the toughest pick up for Trump. The big government vote in northern Virginia is a mountain not easily climbed for a Republican candidate. 
Clinton has a lot of advantages in Virginia. There are wide spread reports of voter fraud in favor of Clinton, the northern Virginia blue vote will be a huge benefit and her running mate Tim Kaine has deep organization across the state. 
That said, Clinton should be dominating in the polls and instead they¡¯re tightening across Virginia in ways they shouldn¡¯t all things considered. On October 19th Clinton lead in the average by nearly 10%. That lead has been cut to just 4.7%, nearly within the margin of error. 
MICHIGAN 
Our sources in Michigan are telling us Trump is gaining massive steam in the state. It¡¯s all about turnout and according to FiveThirtyEight if the popular vote is within 2 points Donald Trump has a 40% chance of picking off Michigan. 
On October 18th the Fox 2 Detroit poll had Clinton up by 13%. Two days ago that same poll had Clinton up by 3%, a lead that sits within the margin of error. 
OHIO 
In pretty much all polls for Ohio over the past several weeks Donald Trump has consistently held a 5% advantage. This plus the fact that there has not been a major poll released after the bombshell FBI news has us confident Ohio is now in Trump¡¯s favor. 
If our projection holds, Trump only needs 11 electoral votes for victory at the 270 mark. And as you can see below, there are a plethora of ways he can accomplish that. All of them, however, are very challenging. 
That challenge exists for Clinton as well. 
Note : Our projection is based on corrected sample weight for a broad variety of polling combined with early voting statistics. CURRENT PROJECTED ELECTORAL VOTE STANDINGS HILLARY CLINTON DONALD TRUMP 259 ELECTORAL VOTES

While the mainstream media has been working day and night promoting Hillary Clinton¡¯s candidacy, it has largely ignored or downplayed violent attacks against supporters of Donald Trump.

Who knew The Donald had those kinds of magical powers? 
Mainstream media bias took a bizarre turn Tuesday when the pro-Hillary New York Times published a report that Donald Trump is now invading the dreams of Muslim children. To illustrate that point, author Samantha Schmidt used anecdotal evidence of a child who said she had a scary dream involving the GOP nominee. 
Schmidt wrote: 
Bilal Elcharfa was pouring cereal for his children before school this month when his 7-year-old daughter, Maaria, walked into the kitchen, calling for him. 
¡°Baba, I had a scary dream,¡± she said, hugging him tight. ¡°About Donald Trump .¡± 
It was the morning after the second presidential debate, which the Elcharfa family¡¯s two youngest daughters watched in the basement of their Staten Island home with their parents. In the middle of the night, Maaria went to her parents¡¯ room twice, unable to sleep, and walked to the living room and checked her family¡¯s security camera. 
That morning, Mr. Elcharfa, 52, asked his daughter what she saw in the nightmare. 
¡°He was so mean to us,¡± she said. ¡°He had a scary face, like a zombie or something.¡± In the dream, Maaria later said, Mr. Trump came to the home of every Muslim family in the country and put each one in jail. 
¡°Many Muslim parents fear that the tensions could push their children away from the faith entirely. ¡°We don¡¯t know how to handle it sometimes,¡± Elcharfa is further quoted. ¡°Maybe someday they won¡¯t believe in anything,¡± Schmidt added. 
But how is this Trump¡¯s fault? Isn¡¯t it the parents¡¯ job to raise their children? 
A post at the American Thinker observed: 
Here we have an article blaming Donald Trump for terrorizing children for something he has never said or even intimated. He doesn¡¯t want to put all Muslims in jail; he just wants to reduce immigration from countries that are un-vettable in the Middle East. One does not translate into the other. 
But that assumes one deals in facts, logic, and reason. As we¡¯ve seen this election season, the so-called ¡°mainstream media,¡± known here as the Democrat-media complex, have decided to toss facts, logic and reason out the window in a concerted effort to elect Democrat Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most evil person ever nominated to the White House by a major party, by any means necessary ¡ª even using propaganda the likes of which would make Josef Goebbels smile. 
There¡¯s no question ¡ª if Democrats nominated Satan, the media would worship him and call you a bigot for opposing him.

Media ratings magnet / Likely to steal all the thunder 
Since Trump¡¯s June 2015 announcement speech, every word or phrase listed above describes what the American electorate witnessed or felt during the campaign because, as I said, Trump¡¯s consistency has been uncanny. 
Now, let¡¯s now examine three quotes from the speech and then refer back to the list. All three reinforce the premise in my headline. But it was the following statement that haunted Trump¡¯s campaign from the second the words left his mouth: 
When Mexico sends its people, they¡¯re not sending their best. They¡¯re not sending you. They¡¯re not sending you. They¡¯re sending people that have lots of problems, and they¡¯re bringing those problems with us. They¡¯re bringing drugs, they¡¯re bringing crime, they¡¯re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people. 
Watching Trump say that on live television, I immediately thought, ¡°There goes the Hispanic vote!¡± The fact is demographic voter data shows that for a Republican to be elected president, he or she must win at least 47% of the national Hispanic vote. Then poof, in one 20-second rant, Trump destroyed all the Republican Party¡¯s Hispanic outreach rendered since Romney won only 27% of the Hispanic vote in 2012. 
From the ¡°impression list,¡± Trump¡¯s inartful Mexican statement branded him with ¡°lacks a political filter,¡± and ¡°lacks presidential demeanor¡± to put it mildly. These two major negative ¡°branding phrases¡± may have begun with his much-maligned Mexican comments, but later applied to numerous Trump-isms which popped up over the last year slowly undermining and unraveling his chances of ever winning 270 electoral votes. 
Next is a Trump foreign policy gem about terrorism: 
Islamic terrorism is eating large portions of the Mideast. They¡¯ve become rich. I¡¯m in competition with them. 
What the #@& does that mean? Let¡¯s go to the ¡°impression list¡± where we apply incoherent, inarticulate, uninformed, and desperately in need of a speech writer , to name just a few. And once again, repeat after me: ¡°Aall we need to know we learned¡­.¡± 
For my last selection, I chose an example of how Trump, right out of the starting gate, tried to antagonize and denigrate other Republican presidential candidates (and later high-ranking party leaders.) It is important to note that Trump made the following statement within the first minute of his announcement speech: 
The other candidates ¡ª they went in, they didn¡¯t know the air conditioning didn¡¯t work. They sweated like dogs. They didn¡¯t know the room was too big because they didn¡¯t have anybody there. How are they gonna beat ISIS? I don¡¯t think it¡¯s gonna happen. 
Yikes! That nonsensical statement exploded the ¡°impression list.¡± It was the opening act of an obstinate candidate who, we found out too late, is totally resistant to change even after his campaign began its slow-motion meltdown. 
Sadly, Trump¡¯s announcement speech stands as living proof that he flunked kindergarten etiquette. Circling back to Flughum¡¯s theory, during his campaign, Trump never learned to clean up his own mess and has never said he was sorry after hurting someone (or a group of someones.) 
In the end, Trump¡¯s likely defeat will be written off as an historical fluke. He will be viewed as a charismatic, untested, one-time outsider candidate who spearheaded a successful movement of fed-up voters. Through his celebrity status, he managed to parlay mass frustration into winning the Republican presidential nomination but, along the way neglected to learn the basics of kindergarten-level political behavior.

The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint Friday against FBI Director James Comey with the Department of Justice, alleging interference with the 2016 presidential election. 
The coalition, an arm of the Keep America Great PAC, filed the complaint with the DOJ¡¯s Office of Professional Responsibility, after Comey announced to Congress that because of new emails discovered on Huma Abedin¡¯s electronic devices relevant to the Hillary Clinton email investigation, the agency would review those emails and assess their relevancy to the investigation . 
For Scott Dworkin, senior advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, the announcement is evidence that Comey, a registered Republican, is attempting to undermine Clinton¡¯s chances of taking the White House. 
In a statement, Dworkin submitted: 
It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election. It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton. 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump has filed numerous complaints with federal agencies about figures connected to the 2016 election. 
On Monday, the group filed a complaint with the FBI against Donald Trump himself for allegedly violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In other words, the group thinks Trump has called for voter intimidation and suppression on a national level. 
Earlier in October, the group also filed a complaint against the Trump campaign and political strategist Roger Stone, saying both were involved with WikiLeaks and also a ¡°foreign government¡± behind the hacks that lead to the release of emails from John Podesta, Clinton¡¯s campaign chair. 
Podesta referred to the FBI¡¯s Friday announcement as ¡°extraordinary.¡± 
¡°It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,¡± Podesta said . ¡°The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining.¡± 
In July, after the FBI came to a conclusion on Clinton¡¯s private email server and said that no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with criminal charges, the Clinton campaign praised Comey as a ¡°well-respected Republican who served as George W. Bush¡¯s Deputy Attorney General.¡± 
Brian Fallon, press secretary for the Clinton campaign, shamed Republicans in September , particularly GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley , for ¡°trying to bully the FBI into serving partisan interests.¡±

According to CBS News , a Des Moines woman has been charged a woman with election misconduct, a Class D felony, after officials said she voted twice. 
Des Moines police Sgt. Paul Parizek says officers charged 55-year-old Terri Rote with first-degree election misconduct on Thursday after being notified by elections officials that she had submitted two absentee ballots.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both oppose the TPP and it would make up 40% of the world¡¯s economy. We simply cannot let this deal go through, patriots! According to Canadian press the US ambassador to Canada has stated that Obama will push for #TPP to passed before Trump takes power. 
This is a corporate money grab. This will not bridge the wealth gap in this country. It will increase it.

Donald Trump has finally done it! Less than a week after his presidential nomination, Trump has kept his word on ¡°Draining the Swamp¡± in Washington DC with a new ruling that has lobbyists p*ssing all over themselves!! 
In a historic move never before seen by a US President, Trump declared that ALL officials working with his campaign, on his transition team, and in his cabinet will be BANNED from working as DC lobbyists for 5 years to prevent them from abusing their connections for self-gain! Image From Gawker 
Not only that, but ANYONE who wants to work for Trump is now required to immediately end ALL of their current connections to lobbying groups or be FIRED instantly. 
But the Donald was not done yet. To put icing on the cake, he has also moved to officially have the term lobbyist apply to ALL DC insiders working as ¡°consultants¡± or ¡°advisors¡± when in reality, ¡°we all know they are lobbyists.¡± Video by CNN ¨C Trump Drain the Swamp!!

Social media is buzzing about Donald Trump¡¯s Hollywood star being destroyed in California. However, it seems that the man responsible just came forward by making a video ¨C but his stupid stunt turned around and slapped him big time when he got bad news just a short time later. 
Since the beginning of his campaign, Trump¡¯s Hollywood star in Los Angeles, California has sustained it¡¯s fair share of vandalism. From people spray painting a Nazi swastika on it to literally taking a crap on it, the most recent stunt was far worse than all the rest. 
Seemingly trying to destroy the star for good, a man, who has since been identified as James Otis, used a sledgehammer and pickaxe in order to help him vandalize the well-known emblem. All caught on video by shocked onlookers, Otis could be seen hitting the star with a pickaxe resulting two plates breaking free. 
As it turns out, those plates depicted both the Hollywood star television emblem and the presidential hopeful¡¯s name. Since that point in time, Otis has come forward in order to claim his fame ¨C but it took mere seconds for him to realize that not everything is exactly going according to his poorly thought out plan when he promptly got some bad news. Donald Trump¡¯s star before (left) and after (right) (Source: TMZ ) 
Although the man states that he¡¯s willing to go to jail for his crimes, he may not have actually known what he was getting himself into. According to The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, the plaque is (or was) worth a whopping $30,000, meaning that Otis admitted to a felony. 
Felony vandalism (damaging over $10,000 worth of property) can result in imprisonment for up to three years in state prison and a fine of up to $50,000. Otis stated that he does intend to turn himself in and has already hired a lawyer, but we¡¯ll see just how tough he is when he has to face a judge. 
The tough guy wannabe later added that he ¡°wanted to face Trump in court,¡± but the idiot must have forgotten that he didn¡¯t destroy Trump¡¯s property, but rather, the state of California¡¯s. Making matters worse for himself, Otis states that he intends to sell the plaques taken from the star on election day, claiming he will donate all the money to Trump¡¯s so-called sexual assault victims. 
Unfortunately for him, the more he talked, the more trouble he got himself into. After all, most people know that selling or buying stolen property is a criminal offense as well. We all know that Hillary Clinton¡¯s voters aren¡¯t the smartest in society, but this guy may just take the cake. Then again, he¡¯ll have plenty of time to think about how dumb he is while he¡¯s pissing his life away behind bars.",english,2016-10-26T23:53:56.256+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,"VIDEO: Idiot Destroys Trump¡¯s Hollywood Star, Gets BAD NEWS Seconds Later",0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/composite_14775128488885.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Liberal news host Dana Bash is evidently no fan of Donald Trump, which she¡¯s not afraid to show in her biased reporting. Her arrogance backfired when she was in front of him at the grand opening of his hotel, thinking she could get away with a public attempt to insult him, but she got rightfully put in her place by the blunt candidate. 
Trump¡¯s schedule is jam packed with as many campaign stops as he can cram into these final weeks of the election, taking advantage of every waking moment to earn Americans¡¯ votes. Somehow in the middle of his traveling to every corner of the country, he managed to squeeze in a stop at his hotel¡¯s grand opening where he created countless jobs and a structure he should be proud of. However, Bash didn¡¯t see it this way in her attempt to slam him for this 90-minute ¡°time off¡± he was taking from campaigning. 
During her live interview at the opening, the nasty CNN reporter had the audacity to sneak in this question: ¡°For people who say youa??re taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?¡± She painted this pit stop as an irresponsible thing to do while Hillary Clinton is working hard.

¡ª Deplorable AJ (@asamjulian) October 26, 2016 
Trump wasn¡¯t going to allow her to get away with asking such a disgusting thing, given the vast difference in effort between him and his opponent and didn¡¯t mince a single word in his priceless answer. 
¡°I say the following. You have been covering me for the last, long time. I did yesterday 8 stops and 3 major speeches. And Ia??ve been doing this for weeks straight. I left for here for an hour-and-a-half. Ia??m leaving here and going to North Carolina, then Ia??m going to Florida, then Ia??m going up to New Hampshire. For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then goes home and sleeps. And yet you ask me that question. I think ita??s a very rude question .¡± 
Bash didn¡¯t see that coming, and Trump proved once again why America needs an unapologetic leader like him. He tells it how it is and backs up what he says with real action, unlike his competition who puts in a couple of days of campaigning and calls it good since it¡¯s all for show anyway. 
Trump is putting in ten times the effort with genuine work ethic on his own dime to honestly earn the votes, and if he wants to take a couple of minutes to make an appearance at an opening, he¡¯s more than entitled to do it. It pales in comparison to the weeks Hillary has had off relaxing and recovering.

Three liberal women were so upset over Donald Trump¡¯s rising poll numbers that they decided to go around stealing the Republican candidate¡¯s campaign signs off of citizens¡¯ lawns. However, just as they were celebrating their bounty on the side of the road, they were instantly smacked with a perfect dose of American justice. 
Liberals are all for free speech unless you disagree with them. In that case, they¡¯ll instantly shut down the conversation by labeling you a racist bigot who hates women. If they¡¯re feeling especially unpatriotic, they¡¯ll let you know that your opinion is hate speech. This is exactly what a group of liberal feminists is claiming after they were recently caught depriving others of their freedom of expression. 
Elizabeth ¡°Betta¡± Stothart, Martha Murdick, and Heidi Kendrick were apparently so angry about Trump¡¯s ¡°locker room talk¡± leaked just in time for the election that they decided to take matters into their own hands. The cowardly trio headed down Route 1 in Falmouth, Maine, plucking Trump-Pence signs from people¡¯s yards and tossing them into their vehicle. What the entitled misandrists didn¡¯t realize was that a heaping dose of karma was headed their way. 
Fox News reports that the women pulled over on the side of the road on October 14, proudly admiring their unlawful deed, when suddenly a police officer approached the guilty party. Tipped off by their late-night suspicious behavior, the officer confiscated 36 stolen signs and made a report of the crime. 
Humiliated that their own ridiculous conduct was found out, the 3 thought that a warning would be the end of their embarrassment. Adding to their dismay, David Jones, the chairman of the Making Maine Great Again political action committee, heard about the sign thieves and immediately pressed charges of theft against all 3 women. Elizabeth ¡°Betta¡± Stothart (pictured) and her accomplices, Martha Murdick and Heidi Kendrick, are scheduled to appear in court. 
¡°I have a lot of explaining and apologizing to do,¡± Stothart wrote. ¡°I also have advice for anyone who might be on the verge of doing something stupid. It¡¯s not worth it. Find a healthy way to express your outrage.¡± 
The Hillary supporters are scheduled to appear in court on December 15, they still can¡¯t believe that stealing is breaking the law and, surprisingly to them, they are not above the law like their beloved candidate. 
The women have been charged with theft and it¡¯s reported that the chairman isn¡¯t letting this go so easily. As cases of campaign sign theft are on the rise, these 3 are likely to be made the example to other potential political thieves. 
In fact, Mad World News reported last week that a Democratic activist was arrested for stealing dozens of Trump-Pence signs in Northfield, Illinois. However, he was only charged with driving with a suspended license and was allowed to keep the stolen property. 
As expected, one of the women made a pathetic attempt to excuse her juvenile behavior. In a Washington Post opinion piece, Stothart whines that she was ¡°angry¡± about the women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment and abuse. Of course, she has no outrage over the women and children that Bill Clinton has sexually assaulted, not to mention the victims Hillary threatened and harassed to protect her sexual predator husband. 
Further insulting actual victims of assault, Stothart likens her selective outrage over Trump signs to being ¡°assaulted,¡± adding that it is ¡°rude¡± for Trump supporters to place signs expressing their political stance on their private property but not equally as offensive for Democrats to show their support for heinous crimes like, say, butchering partially-birthed babies or voting for a woman who laughed about defending a child rapist who she knew was guilty. 
Leftist hacks like Stothart and her gang of mid-life crisis buddies give women a bad name, contributing to the stereotype that the female gender cannot control their emotions. Ending on a comical note, Stothart tells readers ¡°for God¡¯s sake, please, vote.¡± That¡¯s right. A voter for the party that booed God¡¯s name 3 times at their national convention is telling everyone to vote ¡ª unless, of course, you¡¯re voting for Trump.

Although the vandal who thought it was ¡°cool¡± to destroy Donald Trump¡¯s Hollywood star looked pretty comfortable making a video from the comfort of his own home, that can¡¯t be said for him today. In fact, it seems that the idiot just got exactly what he deserved ¨C and that¡¯s not even the real kicker. 
Yesterday, Mad World News reported on James Otis, the man who was recorded destroying Trump¡¯s star on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California and stealing the two plaques that were in the concrete. Of course, he later stated that the two stolen objects would be auctioned off on election day with the proceeds promised to Trump¡¯s so-called ¡°victims.¡± 
Proving to be a cocky moron, Otis gave an itinerary, saying that he wanted to deliver a few remarks at the location of his crime at 9:30 this morning. Unfortunately for him, things didn¡¯t go according to plan as the man just got exactly what he deserved. Donald Trump¡¯s Hollywood star before (left) and after (right) James Otis destroyed it 
Although Otis had promised to turn himself in today, Deadline reports that police tracked him down and arrested him before he could use the incident to further himself any more. Unfortunately for him, the news got even worse when he was officially slapped with a felony vandalism charge. Oh, and that little ¡°auction¡± he was going to have isn¡¯t going to happen since police confiscated at least one of the plaques, which they found stashed in Otis¡¯s car: Police confiscated at least one part of the plaque (Source: TMZ ) 
The real kicker came next, though. Since damages were valued at over $400 , Otis is facing up to 3 years in jail and more than $10,000 in fines. Of course, Otis didn¡¯t seem to mind facing the consequences ¨C until, that is, he heard what he¡¯d actually earned. James Otis 
In fact, he only made himself out to be more of an idiot during an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News when he said, ¡°I was just so fed up, so saddened and fed up by Mr. Trump and how he continues to denigrate women, and he continues to joke and make fun about sexual violence and his own exploits against women.¡± 
Clearly uninformed on the truth, he then added , ¡°It¡¯s just a big joke to him. I have children; I have many women in my life who don¡¯t think it¡¯s a joke. But he does.¡± He continued, ¡°He lies about it, he shuffles and I don¡¯t see, there¡¯s no reason to believe at all that it will ever stop now. He¡¯ll continue to do this, he¡¯ll continue to make women suffer. So that¡¯s what I¡¯d tell him. ¡°You need help. Please understand that.¡± Trump¡¯s star is already being repaired (Source: Breitbart ) 
Otis doesn¡¯t even understand that what he did wasn¡¯t really any big deal. As of right now, the star is being replaced. Furthermore, destroying that property didn¡¯t do a darn thing to Trump since it wasn¡¯t his property ¨C it was the states. In short, he just cost the American taxpayer more money because now we have to fix it. 
That¡¯s the problem with the entitled mentality these days ¨C it doesn¡¯t matter to them who they hurt in the process. Of course, coming off looking like an idiot sure can¡¯t feel good, but he¡¯ll get a nice long time to think about that while he¡¯s rotting in prison for a few years.",english,2016-10-27T22:07:29.319+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,Idiot Who Destroyed Trump Hollywood Star Gets EXACTLY What He Deserves,0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/composite_14775917156404.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Donald Trump¡¯s Diversity Chairwoman Brunell Donald-Kyei has been laying waste to anyone who takes her on, and she just shredded one of Michelle Obama¡¯s favorite spokesmen, Brian Benjamin, who now works on Hillary Clinton¡¯s campaign. When it came to the race card, Brunell was lethal, cutting down his every liberal lie. She tore him apart, then kicked him to the curb, as another Michelle and Hillary spokesman bit the dust. Michelle Obama¡¯s favorite pundit Brian Benjamin (left), Hillary & her hot sauce (middle), Brunell Donald-Kyei (right) 
Brian Benjamin kept an arrogant smile on his face as Donald Trump¡¯s Diversity Chairwoman Brunell Donald-Kyei surgically sliced through Hillary¡¯s pandering to the black community. They appeared on Fox and Friends a few days ago and the video is only getting more popular as interest in Brunell¡¯s tactics is making headlines. 
Unsurprisingly, Fox & Friends Monday has been focusing on the latest to emerge out of the WikiLeaks scandal, and one detail concerning the use of the phrase ¡° yo mama ,¡± suggested a pandering effort to an African American crowd by Clinton earlier this year. Joining Fox & Friends to discuss was vice-chair of the Trump National Diversity Coalition Brunell Donald-Kyei who said, ¡°The pandering is not working. Black people just want a real seat at the table.¡± [via Mediaite ] 
As Brunell laid Benjamin out cold, he had to pull out the race card, but that was a wrong move. Brunell was waiting for it, and she launched into a tirade that made Hillary and her ¡°hot sauce¡± in my purse comment look as stupid as it sounded, as poor Steve Doocy tried to moderate. 
Brunell went off, saying the communities need jobs, not hot sauce and ¡°yo mama¡± jokes. She added that the black community wants empowerment and the Democratic party to keep its promises. Benjamin was quick to interrupt, alleging Trump talks about law and order but ignores systemic issues between the community and the police. However, Brunell wasn¡¯t about to let him get away with his lie. 
She quickly pointed out that mass incarceration happened under Bill and Hillary Clinton, telling Benjamin that he knows that too. ¡°His wife [Hillary] was ok with that. So don¡¯t go there,¡± she said. ¡°Let Donald Trump fix it. Let a person who is a builder and a doer fix it.¡± 
Benjamin tried to retort, calling Trump a racist, and that¡¯s all it took to really cause Brunell to unleash. ¡° Not a loser, not a taco bowl, or needy Latino? Really? Are we going there? Catholics are bastardized. Are we going there? ¡° she asked, referring to the WikiLeaks emails that exposed the Hillary camp¡¯s true thoughts and nasty remarks about many Americans. 
Benjamin shot back, ¡°Yea, let¡¯s go there,¡± before Brunell finished him off, saying, ¡°I went there, WikiLeaks is out in the streets, Sir. I read WikiLeaks. I read about the corruption.¡± 
This exchange proves that when these Hillary shills get beat, they turn to the race card every time. When Brunell hears that, as a black woman, she can go full throttle at Benjamin, and his nervous laughter and scoffing means he is embarrassed and lost this argument, which shreds Hillary¡¯s whole narrative about why Americans shouldn¡¯t vote for Trump. 
Hillary is a one note wonder. She has no positive record to run on, and her whole campaign is based on bullying Trump supporters. In her narrative, Trump is a Nazi and so are those of us who support him. So, we are fair game to be bullied ¡ª on the internet or in person as we have seen the paid thugs do. 
It¡¯s all smoke and mirrors because it just doesn¡¯t hold true, and Brunell brought that out as she left Benjamin, one of Hillary¡¯s token black spokesmen, to languish as he failed to make anyone believe the lie Hillary is trying to sell to Americans. This is all Hillary¡¯s got to run on, and it will not be enough to win.",english,2016-10-27T23:22:35.506+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,Badass Trump Chairwoman SHREDS Michelle & Hillary¡¯s Favorite Spokesman,0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/composite_14775900688479.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

It¡¯s become a trend for Hillary Clinton-supporters with far too much time on their hands to steal any Donald Trump sign they can get their grubby hands on. There¡¯s no returning the ¡°favor¡± by taking a Hillary sign since they are practically non-existent in almost all neighborhoods. So, one proud patriot took retaliation to new heights ensuring liberals stay away from his sign. 
The unnamed owner of the Trump sign, who is believed to be in Arizona, is aware that his sign may not cost a lot but is worth much more than the plastic it¡¯s printed on based on what it represents ¡ª a chance to take America back. Hillary-supporters are an odd group of people who seem to believe that the Constitutional right to free speech is only bestowed upon them, along with the power to take it from anyone who says something that they don¡¯t like. 
Perhaps this the driving purpose behind the nationwide rash of Trump sign theft, paired with the fact that they think that they¡¯re ¡°helping¡± by removing these visual statements of support from public view. Either way, where there is a Trump sign, there¡¯s a liberal nearby waiting for their chance to make a stupid statement of their own in stealing it. 
However, this sign owner beat them to the punch by putting it in a place that was not only impossible to reach but showed his support of the GOP candidate loud and proud. It sat up high in a tall tree, keeping it out of reach for thieving liberals. Taking Trump sign to new heights to prevent it from being stolen and make a bold message at the same time. 
If liberals really want to show their support for Hillary, they¡¯ll have to climb this massive tree and tear it down, but chances are, they¡¯re not as tough as they think they are and prefer to stick to easy to steal signs. We commend the hero for Trump who showed his bravery in putting the sign up so high, knowing that no liberal would dare to go there since it¡¯s so far out of their safe space and more work than they are willing to perform.",english,2016-10-27T23:36:11.932+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,Badass Patriot Has MASSIVE Surprise For Thieves Who Stole His Trump Sign,0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/trumpSign.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Hillary Clinton is once again pandering to the black community as she¡¯s often done, changing who she is depending on who she is talking to. However, just yesterday, she made a wrong move, hitting Donald Trump¡¯s supporters as she told a hip-hop radio show that Trump and his supporters need to do one thing. Unfortunately for her, she quickly learned that she can¡¯t talk trash and get away with it anymore. 
Hillary showed up on some hip-hop radio station in New York yesterday, and the interview was pure propaganda as she tried to pander to the black community. Hillary even agreed that she gets her fashion look from Death Row Records¡¯ Suge Knight and Snoop Dogg. 
Wherever she gets it, that look is hideous and horrible. Not to mention, Death Row Records was made famous by a song titled ¡°F*ck The Police.¡± That seems rather fitting since Hillary doesn¡¯t care about cops.

After talking about her failed fashion sense, she had to get her jab in on Donald Trump, but she took it further than she should have. The Breakfast Club radio host told Hillary that the whole country is divided and that she has to bring it back together. This sparked Hillary to launch her attack, saying: 
¡° What Trump has done is to make it possible for people who have racist and sexist and all kinds of prejudices and bigotry to put them right out there ,¡± Hillary said. ¡°But what he¡¯s done really [is] unleashed a lot of darkness and divisiveness.¡± 
We all know the only game Hillary¡¯s got going is this thinly veiled narrative that Trump supporters are racist, sexist, and violent. We are ¡°deplorables,¡± a remark she purposefully made to describe Trump supporters because it is her campaign plan. 
Unfortunately for her, Trump supporters aren¡¯t stupid, and those who are very active on social media fought back at her false rhetoric. For hours after her comments on that radio show, the hashtag # HillarysBullies was trending worldwide. 
Trump supporters made a mockery out of Hillary , sending a truth bomb straight at her. It¡¯s Hillary who is purposely dividing the country with her rhetoric. It¡¯s Hillary who hired paid thugs to beat up Trump supporters.

Hillary is losing this election. Every indication outside the mainstream press shows that there¡¯s little to no enthusiasm for her campaign. Record-breaking numbers of Trump supporters have been seen across the country where early voting is allowed, and even today, Hillary needed Michelle Obama to beg North Carolinians to bring out people to vote. 
With only days left, Trump supporters slapped Hillary hard on social media, and all she¡¯s got is a weak campaign slogan and the lie that Trump¡¯s a racist and so are his deplorable supporters.

The upcoming election has our nation on pins and needles, but none more so than the idiots on the left. Proving just that was a few morons who decided to run over a Donald Trump lawn sign that they saw on the side of the road ¨C and that¡¯s when they got slapped with the perfect dose of justice. 
The incident was posted to the Twitter account of a black Trump supporter named Tallah who lives in Detroit, Michigan. Now, if ever there was a place that should be sick of Democrats, it should be Detroit, but apparently, there are still people living in the city who enjoy living life as a slave to the government. Tallah (right) (Photo Source: Twitter ) 
Proving just that, it seems that a few of Tallah¡¯s Trump lawn signs triggered a liberal who just had to do something about it. Captured by pictures after the fact, the idiot decided the best way to voice his negative opinion on Trump was to destroy the woman¡¯s property. 
As can be seen, the idiot decided to swerve off the road and run over 4 signs that were sitting in Tallah¡¯s front lawn. Unfortunately for him, he was about to get a nasty dose of instance justice ¨C and it¡¯s just delectable. Triggered lefty ran over Tallah¡¯s Trump signs but got a nasty surprise (Photo Source: Twitter ) 
As it turns out, this clearly wasn¡¯t the first run in that Tallah had with triggered liberals. She put out a little surprise for anyone who would try what this triggered lefty did. Also captured in the photos was the woman¡¯s homemade booby trap ¨C a board with nails sticking up just below the signs. Booby trap (Photo Source: Twitter ) 
At the end of the day, the trap did exactly what it was supposed to ¨C popped the tires of an entitled piece of garbage that thought they could do whatever they wanted. Too bad for them, Tallah even managed to get a picture of the idiot responsible as he tried to put the spare tire on his car. Triggered liberals licking their wounds (Photo Source: Twitter ) 
However, it seems that the popped tire wasn¡¯t even the best part of the picture. After zooming in on the morons¡¯ faces, their expression shows that they received every bit of justice that they deserved. Even better yet, the signs weren¡¯t even really destroyed. It looks like all Tallah would need to do is bend them back up to standing position. Close up on the entitled punks¡¯ faces (Photo Source: Twitter ) 
It just goes to show, the entitled mentality is getting out of hand in this country. However, if liberals want to play dirty at every corner, we can whip out a few tricks of our own.

Hillary Receives DEVASTATING News On Her Poll Lead Over Trump,"Share This Hillary Clinton is undoubtedly having a terrible day after finding out the FBI investigation has been reopened. However, she¡¯s was instantly steamrolled with more devastating news concerning her recent poll lead. 
Hillary Clinton and her leftist lapdog media have been busy celebrating her ¡°imminent¡± victory, practically declaring her president before the election is even over. However, in an unbelievable turn of events, she just received some potentially devastating news about her poll lead over Donald Trump that has the nation in an uproar. 
Just recently, Hillary and her team of liberal shills were busted ¡°rigging elections¡± with both massive voter fraud at the polls and working with mainstream media outlets to perpetuate a bias against Trump to cover her own felonious scandals. The partiality and voter fraud are so severe that many were left wondering if there¡¯s really any way to beat Hillary or if it¡¯s a predetermined selection from the liberal elitists. 
Just as Hillary thought she was going to hobble straight into the White House again, however, she received some news that crucially threatens her election during the most critical time. 
Breitbart reports that less than one week after Trump was suffering an immense lag behind Hillary in the polls, the gap is suddenly coming to a close with the Republican nominee leaping forward a massive 5 points, leaving him just 4 behind the Democratic opponent. Even though Trump was at 38 percent on October 22, he has since rapidly climbed to 44 percent and is expected to seal the gap. 
The unbelievable rise in Trump¡¯s support comes just before the FBI announced that it is reopening their investigation into Hillary¡¯s private email server, meaning that his approval rating is sure to skyrocket even further with the great chance that he¡¯ll surpass the scandalous liberal candidate just as voters head to the polls. Even before the FBI announced it will re-investigate Hillary Clinton¡¯s private email server, Trump was already closing the polling gap. It¡¯s likely that he will easily catch up to her since more classified emails have been leaked. 
What¡¯s even more miraculous is that Trump is fighting against all odds, including a stifling media bias that¡¯s found to wholly working against him with 91 percent of 184 opinionated statements considered to be negative. However, even this buying of the mainstream media hasn¡¯t stopped the hypothetical Trump train, as the underdog candidate even won early votes in Florida and is the only Republican to do so in the critical swing state. 
Although Hillary and her media pets have been tirelessly scheming around the clock to discourage citizens from voting for Trump, reporting fake poll numbers that show her in a major lead, even the left-leaning ABC and Washington Post couldn¡¯t deny Trump¡¯s rapid incline. Not only has Trump gained 5 points, according to their tracking poll, Hillary fell 2, meaning that either undecided or Hillary voters are beginning to support Trump. 
Ironically, even Hillary¡¯s campaign manager Robby Mook was forced to admit that Trump could very well be the next U.S. President. 
¡°Donald Trump has been going around telling people not to listen to the polls, and saying that he can still win this race. Well, you know what, he¡¯s absolutely right,¡± Mook announced in a video. 
Just minutes after FBI Director James Comey officially announced the reopened investigation, the stocks suddenly started to tank , which many believe is indicative of a Trump win. It appears as though the liberal elite and Wall Street bankers are panicking at the idea that the easily bought Hillary might not make it to November 8. 
Regardless of your stance on the presidential election, it¡¯s clear that the mainstream media has been purchased and is striving to scare Trump voters away from the polls. Considering that this is true, imagine just how many more potential Trump voters are staying home because they feel as though a victory is hopeless ¡ª when, indeed, it¡¯s obviously not.",english,2016-10-29T00:17:12.419+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,Surprise!

A homeless black woman who has been guarding Donald Trump¡¯s Hollywood Walk of Fame star from vandals was recently set upon by ruthless liberals, ripping up her signs and assaulting the helpless woman. However, as soon as Trump heard about what the leftist thugs had done, he immediately issued a special announcement that has us cheering. 
After privileged millionaire James Otis obliterated the Donald¡¯s sidewalk star on Wednesday, an unnamed homeless woman boldly took it upon herself to act as guardian, making the cold slab her new temporary home. Utilizing her sleeping spot as her own political platform, the courageous vagrant created signs to peacefully showcase her support for Trump. Unfortunately, she underestimated just how savage and intolerant liberals are, especially when it comes to the minorities they claim to champion expressing a different opinion. 
Just one day after the homeless woman set up residence next to Trump¡¯s star, a mob of vicious anti-Trump thugs attacked her, RT reports. After pushing her around and stealing her signs, some of the only property she owns, the animals knocked her and her cart down, continuing to hurl sickening insults and snatch things. 
Video captured the enraging assault, showing the woman lying on the ground, shaking, and holding back tears. Fortunately, the heart-breaking story quickly made its way to Trump, the only politician concerned with this transient¡¯s well-being. Now, the Republican nominee has made an incredible announcement befitting of a U.S. president. 
The Gateway Pundit reports that Trump was so appalled by the mob¡¯s treatment of this destitute woman that he has not only announced that he has a special ¡°gift¡± for the victim but promises to seek justice for her barbaric abusers. The presidential candidate¡¯s attorney, Michael Cohen, proclaimed on Friday that Trump promises the woman will have ¡°the last laugh on these thugs.¡± . @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump someone please help me locate this woman as Mr. Trump has a gift for her¡­ 
¡ª Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) October 28, 2016 
At Trump¡¯s behest, Cohen exploded on Twitter, repeatedly requesting followers to find the homeless woman. He explained that they have checked, but she is no longer staying on Trump¡¯s star. However, the candidate wants to ¡°change her life¡± when he finds her. 
Proving just how passionate Trump is about helping the woman, Cohen spent much of Friday responding to tweets, hoping to find some clue as to the woman¡¯s current whereabouts. One user asserted that the woman is Marsha Lee , a resident of Santa Monica. However, it is unclear if this information is accurate. 
Cohen assured that the police are investigating the incident and he and Trump will do everything possible to see that the thugs responsible for the assault are brought to justice. It¡¯s truly heart-warming to see such a powerful man going out of his way to do something significant for someone considered ¡°the least of these.¡± 
Hopefully, this woman will receive the mystery gift Trump has waiting for her and the savages who bullied an innocent homeless person will be punished for their cowardly behavior. Of course, don¡¯t expect Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama to say that her black life matters or even apologize for the thuggery of their own supporters. In fact, neither of them has come forward to help the unfortunate victim of their national policies that never helped her off the streets in the first place. 
This stomach-churning incident just goes to show how tolerant the left is when it comes to blacks, or anyone else for that matter, simply having an opinion with which they disagree.",english,2016-10-30T04:13:48.051+02:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,Trump Makes Special Announcement After Homeless Lady Attacked By Liberals,0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screenshot-1652.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

From the moment the FBI announced they¡¯re investigating Hillary Clinton again, her ship of supporters quickly became lighter with people bailing out to protect themselves from being associated with her as a criminal. Donald Trump¡¯s campaign couldn¡¯t have asked for better vindication that the witch could soon be incarcerated, but the Republican candidate¡¯s campaign manager just put the final nail in Clinton¡¯s coffin. 
In the wake of this latest development that could save Western civilization, Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News to discuss it, but she delivered more than viewers were expecting. In a statement that didn¡¯t just decimate Hillary¡¯s campaign, she brought the entire Clinton family down with it in one perfectly stated sentence. 
When the FBI cracks a case back open that they had previously closed, there¡¯s a legitimate reason to be terrified for the outcome of that investigation, and it¡¯s almost guaranteed to end in incarceration. Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom validated this when he said after the announcement that the final bomb is about to drop on Hillary within the next ten days. Adding to everything coming back to haunt Hillary since Friday, is what Conway said on Fox News: 
¡°What we are reminded of is this cloud of corruption that always follows Hillary Clinton and we are having this entire conversation about a renewed FBU investigation because Hillary Clinton did what she always does, put Hillary first¡­we can never get the stench and the stain of the Clintons off if us it turns out.¡± 
Call it karma or the combined forces of WikiLeaks, James O¡¯Keefe, and now the FBI, who are all working together to bleach this ¡°stain¡± from the White House, but things just aren¡¯t looking good for Hillary who had it coming. Hopefully, the FBI who failed the American people after the first investigation that ended with her still being able to run for president, make good on that mistake by actually arresting her after round two. 
The investigation now is entirely different than the first, considering the fact that it was reopened.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made a prediction over a year ago that many brushed aside.

Donald Trump doesn¡¯t always say things in the most eloquent of ways. He often speaks what¡¯s on his mind with no filter and doesn¡¯t seem to care much about who he offends. His politically incorrect way of speaking causes too many to disregard what he has to say, but that¡¯s all about to change after what just happened. Trump called this one over a year ago, and now, thanks to Hillary¡¯s email scandal, he¡¯s been proven accurate. 
The FBI announced Friday that it had uncovered new emails relating to its investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton¡¯s handling of classified information. This was discovered while conducting a separate investigation into the perverted and disgusting sexting habits of former Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner, who is the estranged husband of Hillary¡¯s closest aide, Huma Abedin, who is also front and center in Hillary Clinton¡¯s email scandals. 
Donald Trump saw this coming from a mile away, pointing fingers at Weiner as a potential national security threat all the way back in August of 2015. ¡°It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary¡¯s private illegal emails,¡± Trump wrote on Twitter. ¡° Huma¡¯s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world. ¡± Trump has been now been proven right.

Michelle Obama has been hot on the campaign trail to help Hillary Clinton replace her corrupt husband, proving that Democrats care more about power than the American people. After dropping everything for ¡°her girl¡± Hillary and running to North Carolina to speak on her behalf, Michelle ran her mouth about Donald Trump, but it immediately came back to bite her. 
While Trump is capable of doing his own talking and campaigning, Hillary needs a lot of help to make it through this election season, and she¡¯s getting it from a number of Democrats, namely, the Obamas. Both Michelle and Barack Obama have campaigned for the ailing criminal candidate numerous times, including at her North Carlina stop on Thursday where Michelle acted as Hillary¡¯s sorority sister more than her campaign supporter, after completely bashing Trump. 
According to the Daily Mail , the two ¡°First Ladies¡± acted as if the campaign stop was a teenage popularity contest as they stood on stage like a couple of best friends, who are actually enemies. Only able to discuss what makes Hillary so great by trash-talking Hillary¡¯s opponent, Michelle said, ¡°We want a president who takes this job seriously and has the temperament and maturity to do it well. Someone who is steady. Someone who we can trust with the nuclear codes.¡± 
Apparently, Michelle wasn¡¯t paying attention to the presidential debates when her gal pal committed treason by spilling what America¡¯s nuclear response time is. Seemingly forgetting who she was talking about and all that this woman is accused of, sanctimonious Michelle rambled on about what an awesome example Hillary is for our children as if we¡¯re supposed to take parenting advice from a mother who raises her daughters around foul-mouthed rappers. 
¡°We know the influence our president has on our children,¡± she later added. ¡°They turn on the TV and they see the most powerful role model in the world ¨C someone who shows them how to treat others. How to deal with disappointment. Whether to tell the truth. They¡¯re taking it all in.¡± In making this statement, she didn¡¯t realize she was actually speaking against Hillary, who is the opposite of the honest role model she described. The label is more fitting for Trump. 
She closed her speech with a declaration of desperation, pleading with the crowd that if nothing else, choose Hillary because as ¡°First ladies, we rock.¡± Then, she begged anyone who would listen to keep ¡°working your hearts out for my girl.¡± This little cheerleading act is very convenient, but it backfired on Michelle when the past came back to haunt her. Hillary isn¡¯t ¡°her girl.¡± In fact, they¡¯re ¡°frenemies¡± at best since she was previously recorded talking behind Hillary¡¯s back, saying, ¡°If you can¡¯t run your own house, you can¡¯t run the White House,¡± in reference to Bill Clinton¡¯s extra-marital affairs.

When Brett Mauthe woke up last Monday morning, he was eager to get his ballot in early and secure a vote for Trump while the Republican nominee¡¯s approval rate continues to rise. The 55-year-old Texan got dressed, put on his favorite hat, and headed out the door. Unfortunately, he didn¡¯t realize that it was his choice of clothing that would not only prohibit him from voting but also land him inside a jail cell. 
KSAT 12 reports that Bulverde polling officials confronted Mauthe when they spotted him wearing a pro-Trump hat and a t-shirt that read ¡°Basket of Deplorables,¡± a sarcastic reference to Hillary¡¯s crude remarks about conservative voters. Apparently unaware that he wasn¡¯t allowed to sport campaign gear inside the polling station, Mauthe removed his hat but refused to turn his shirt inside out. It was then that the officials called the police and had him arrested. 
Mauthe was placed in cuffs and charged with electioneering and loitering as local police threw the book at the confused man. Like Mauthe, voters at the same polling place were shocked that wearing such clothing is not only prohibited at the polls but can result in a misdemeanor charge . Brett Mauthe, 55, was charged with electioneering and loitering for wearing a ¡°Basket of Deplorables¡± t-shirt mocking Hillary Clinton¡¯s crude reference to conservatives. 
¡°I don¡¯t feel like you should be preaching to anybody, but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate,¡± Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote Wednesday morning. ¡°I¡¯m kind of shocked because I think that¡¯s part of the freedoms that we¡¯re voting for. ¡° 
While Mauthe is wholly responsible for not following the rules, although he may not have understood the severity of his violation, we¡¯re betting that career politicians are keen on the election rules. Proving that the liberal elites are above the rules, Hillary herself was caught breaking the same law as Mauthe but with a very different outcome. This year, Hillary was caught campaigning in front of a North Carolina polling station and Bill was busted thanking Hillary voters over a loudspeaker within 20 feet of a Massachusetts polling station. Unlike Mauthe, neither of the Clintons were arrested. 
Mad World News reported that Hillary was captured on video campaigning in front of Raleigh¡¯s Chavis Center, a polling place in North Carolina. The female candidate walked straight up to early voters, greeting them and snapping selfies as if she was at one of her own rallies. Of course, the scheming doesn¡¯t end there. 
In March of this year, Bill was busted thanking ¡°those of you who are supporting Hillary Clinton¡± with a loudspeaker while within 20 feet of a Massachusetts polling station. His massive police detail also blocked civilians from entering the precinct to vote. The Daily Kos reports that even though electioneering, which is Mauthe¡¯s crime, is only a misdemeanor, interfering with voting rights is a felony, which is exactly what Bill did. As expected, Mauthe was arrested and charged for his crimes, but Bill was fawned over and even abetted by police officers. 
Although Mauthe definitely broke the law when he refused to remove his shirt, his real crime is that he wasn¡¯t a Hillary supporter. If he had been a liberal celebrity or the husband of a Democratic politician, he would¡¯ve been allowed to block voters and openly campaign for his choice right there in the station. 
The bias is clear a?? not only are the electronic polling machines switching votes for the left, influential Democrats are potentially changing views right there in the polling stations. It¡¯s undeniable that, regardless of the results, the American people don¡¯t stand a chance at a fair election.",english,2016-10-31T19:35:42.585+02:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,Trump Voter Arrested When Officials See What His Shirt Says About Hillary,0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screenshot-173.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

In a sad story that went viral, thugs beat up a homeless black woman who was defending Donald Trump¡¯s star on Hollywood Boulevard. Now, those thugs have been identified. Shockingly, these Hillary Clinton thugs are nothing but bullies who beat up anyone supporting Trump, even the elderly and disabled, but the good news is, the homeless black woman is getting much-deserved justice. A black homeless woman was beaten up by Hillary thugs for protecting Donald Trump¡¯s ¡°star¡±& supporting him in this election. 
After an idiot took a jackhammer to Donald Trump¡¯s Hollywood ¡°Star of Fame,¡± one brave black homeless woman decided to protect it from further damage. That brought out the Hillary bullies, but there was one problem. None of them could be identified because   kept the best video evidence from getting out. 
Now, Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars has obtained a clear copy of what happened, and we now have enough evidence to identify the attackers. In the video, Watson does an excellent job of identifying two of the Hillary bullies. One he calls ¡° Trigglypuff ,¡± an obese woman who may identify as a man, is wanted for felony assault by Los Angeles police, and another man, who ironically is wearing a cross necklace, taunted the homeless woman, saying, ¡°Didn¡¯t I tell you about five minutes ago that no I would not defend you because you spewed hate and you got hate, you got exactly what you were dishing out.¡± ¡°Trigglypuff¡± (the name given to social justice warriors who get triggered) is caught on video, wanted by police for felony assault. The thug who yelled, ¡°Didn¡¯t I tell you,¡± is caught on video and also wanted by Los Angeles police for aiding and abetting a felony assault. 
The California homeless woman sat on the star with a sign that read, ¡°20 Million Illegals and Americans Sleep in the Streets In Tents, Vote For Trump.¡± That was the ¡°hate¡± she was spewing, and here is the backward logic the Hillary bullies are selling, as Watson sarcastically points out , ¡°Didn¡¯t I tell you if you disagree if you dare disagree with our retarded political opinions you get physically attacked by a sack of sh*t [Trigglypuff] and by the way it¡¯s your fault for spewing hate.¡± 
Another thug can be heard saying not to call an ambulance as they continue to laugh at the victim, but there is a silver lining. This latest video gives the police all they need to formally identify ¡°Trigglypuff,¡± who is wanted for felony assault and those other thugs who aided and abetted the felony crime of beating this homeless woman. 
This incident has gotten so much attention, and the police are very motivated to do everything they can to track down these Hillary bullies. It¡¯s just a matter of time, and they will be positively identified. In the meantime, Trump dispatched one of his representatives to Los Angeles to find the homeless woman to give her ¡°something.¡± I¡¯m sure Trump was moved by this woman¡¯s plight, and what he is offering will help her in the dire situation she finds herself in. 
This story was not on any mainstream media networks, but imagine if the homeless woman was a Hillary supporter and Trump supporters beat her up. We all know it would be reported on 24/7 on CNN and MSNBC with panels of experts discussing Trump and his supporters who commit acts of violence. 
As Watson concludes in his video, the only thugs acting out after this election will be the paid Hillary bullies who time after time have shown up at Trump events and used violence against peaceful citizens. Luckily, their sick reign of shame and violence is coming to an end as Hillary is falling apart and Trump will be elected our next president.",english,2016-11-01T19:26:15.493+02:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,"Hillary Thugs IDENTIFIED, Homeless Woman Protecting Trump Star Gets Justice",0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/composite_14780135216780.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Donald Trump¡¯s adviser on Israel said on Wednesday that Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank are not illegal, adding that he believes the candidate agrees with him, putting the pair at odds with much of the world.
Speaking to AFP at a rooftop restaurant on Jerusalem¡¯s Mount Zion after a pro-Trump rally, David Friedman also said the US presidential candidate was ¡°tremendously sceptical¡± about the prospects for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The compound is holy to both Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount. Located in East Jerusalem, it was occupied by Israel in 1967 and later annexed in a move never recognised by the international community.
Asked whether Trump viewed the West Bank as part of Israel, as many far-right Israelis do, Friedman did not answer directly.

The US has intensified criticism of Israeli settlement building in the West Bank in recent months, warning that it is eating away at hopes for a two-state solution.
Settlements in the West Bank are viewed as illegal under international law and are major stumbling blocks to peace efforts because they are built on land seized in the 1967 war which Palestinians see as part of their future state.
At an American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in March, Trump described an ¡°unbreakable bond¡± between the US and Israel.
¡°When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one,¡± Trump told delegates, in a speech that heaped praise on Israel and derided Palestinians as perpetrators of violence.
Recalling rounds of failed peace talks between the two parties, Trump blamed Palestinian leaders.
¡°To make a great deal, you need two willing participants,¡± Trump said. ¡°We know Israel is willing to deal. Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without preconditions for years.¡±
Friedman reiterated that Trump would recognise Jerusalem as Israel¡¯s capital and move the US embassy there ¨C which would break with decades of precedent and put Washington at odds with most UN member states.

Donald Trump likes to boast about the endorsement he¡¯s received from military personnel, but he¡¯ll have to work a lot harder to win over those who serve if he is elected as the next Commander-in-Chief. As was recently reported, 55 generals denounced the Republican Presidential candidate in a historic rebuke last week. And now, a group of female veterans with the Common Defense PAC have released a compelling new ad called ¡°Blue Falcon¡±. 
The Common Defense PAC defines itself as ¡°a diverse group of male and female veterans¡± who represent the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Army Reserves, and Air National Guard. In the ad below, women from various branches of the military explain their aspirations for serving, as well as their disgust with the business tycoon who is running for President. Said veteran Wendy Barranco: ¡°As a migrant, I wanted to give something back to this country that had given me and my family so much. So I became an Army combat medic. When you¡¯re fighting to save a fellow soldier¡¯s life, things get real very quickly. You have to trust your team.¡± 
It¡¯s made clear, however, that Donald Trump is not the guy you¡¯d want on your team. Barranco continued: ¡°Guys like Donald Trump? We call them Blue Falcons.¡± 
In case you¡¯re not familiar with the term, it¡¯s a derogatory euphemism for ¡°buddy-fucker.¡± The women also explain that a Blue Falcon is the type of person who will step on their teammate to get ahead . 
From his declaration that it should be ¡°expected¡± for rape to take place in the military to his inappropriate and abrasive comments toward women, minorities, and disabled individuals, he is not the best candidate for President, the veterans assert.

Be Sociable, Share! Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Sunrise, Fla. 
With the 2016 election campaign winding down, the Clinton campaign is ratcheting up demands for the FBI to publicly confirm the campaign¡¯s allegations that Republican nominee Donald Trump is secretly in league with Russia. Sen. Harry Reid (D ¨C NV) went so far as to claim the FBI has secret ¡°explosive¡± evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government that it is withholding. FBI officials familiar with their investigations into the allegations, which the Clinton campaign started publicizing around the Democratic National Convention, say they¡¯ve turned up nothing to connect Trump and Russia , leading FBI Director James Comey to decide against making any statements to that effect. 
The Clinton campaign has been making the allegations so long that they have taken to claiming ¡°everyone knows¡± that they are true, and appears unsettled by the FBI¡¯s refusal to sign off on the claims simply because they haven¡¯t been able to find real evidence corroborating the story. 
The Trump campaign has repeatedly denied ties to Russia, but that didn¡¯t stop Clinton from calling Trump a ¡°puppet¡± of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the final presidential debate. The calls have grown since Friday¡¯s FBI report to Congress about further Clinton emails being sought. 
With Clinton¡¯s main campaign scandal growing in the waning weeks of the deal, some in her campaign have suggested that affirming Trump as secretly in league with the Russians would only be fair. Absent any evidence, however, it appears that won¡¯t be happening.

One day after Julian Assange officially revealed for the first time that the source of hacked Podesta and DNC emails in Wikileaks¡¯ possession is not Russia, in the second excerpt from the John Pilger Special, to be broadcast by RT on Saturday Julian Assange accuses Hillary Clinton of misleading Americans about the true scope of Islamic State¡¯s support from Washington¡¯s Middle East allies. 
As previously reported, in an August 17, 2014 email made public WikiLeaks last month, Hillary Clinton, who had served as secretary of state until the year before, urges John Podesta, then an advisor to Barack Obama, to ¡°bring pressure¡± on Qatar and Saudi Arabia, ¡°which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIS and other radical Sunni groups.¡± 
¡°I think this is the most significant email in the whole collection,¡± Assange, whose whistleblowing site released three tranches of Clinton-related emails over the past year, told Pilger in the interview. ¡°All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some ¡°rogue¡± princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.¡± 
As recounted by RT , Assange and Pilger, who sat down for their 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where the whistleblower has been a refugee since 2012, also talked about the conflict of interest between Clinton¡¯s official post, her husband¡¯s nonprofit, and the Middle East officials, whose stated desire to fight terrorism may not have been sincere. John Pilger: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly Saudi Arabia. 
Julian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton ¨C and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it ¨C the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value. 
JP: Of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation? 
JA: Yes. 
The conversation then turns to the imminent presidential election: Pilger questioned Assange over increasingly frequent accusations from the Clinton camp, and Western media, that WikiLeaks is looking to swing next week¡¯s US presidential election in favor of Donald Trump ¨C perhaps at Russia¡¯s behest. 
However, just as he did last week, Assange again dismissed the prospect of Trump, who is almost tied in the polls, winning as unlikely, and not necessarily due to his standing with the electorate. 
¡°My analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment,¡± said Assange. ¡°Banks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves.¡± 
He is right, but the same was said about Brexit.

Contrary to his anti-establishment stance ¡ª which supporters readily boast as a viable alternative to Hillary Clinton ¡ª Donald Trump¡¯s establishment roots run so deep, the billionaire real estate mogul plans to appoint a former Goldman Sachs partner and George Soros Fund manager as Secretary of the Treasury should he win the election.
Steve Mnuchin came on board Trump¡¯s campaign as finance chair in May, raising eyebrows of many who felt his 17-year history with Sachs ¡ª and affiliation with liberal globalist George Soros as an Investment Professional of Soros Fund Management ¡ª conflicted directly with the then-presumptive nominee¡¯s conservative stance and criticisms of establishment politicians.
¡°It is difficult to see how a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner would secure such a prominent position in an administration delivered by a populist wind,¡± Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky told Politico of Trump¡¯s curious choice for Treasury Secretary.
According to Fox Business Network , Trump¡¯s confidence in winning the White House has fomented enough to begin picking Cabinet members, and besides the anomalous choice of Mnuchin for the Treasury, sources said he¡¯s considering New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for Attorney General and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for Homeland Security Secretary.
Trump has, of course, expended great efforts in criticizing opponent Hillary Clinton¡¯s deep ties to the banking and Wall Street elite; and prior to garnering the Republican nomination, extended that critique to competitor Ted Cruz, saying in one debate:

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Sunrise, Fla. 
Contrary to his anti-establishment stance ¡ª which supporters readily boast as a viable alternative to Hillary Clinton ¡ª Donald Trump¡¯s establishment roots run so deep, the billionaire real estate mogul plans to appoint a former Goldman Sachs partner and George Soros Fund manager as Secretary of the Treasury should he win the election. 
Steve Mnuchin came on board Trump¡¯s campaign as finance chair in May, raising eyebrows of many who felt his 17-year history with Sachs ¡ª and affiliation with liberal globalist George Soros as an Investment Professional of Soros Fund Management ¡ª conflicted directly with the then-presumptive nominee¡¯s conservative stance and criticisms of establishment politicians. 
¡°It is difficult to see how a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner would secure such a prominent position in an administration delivered by a populist wind,¡± Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky told Politico of Trump¡¯s curious choice for Treasury Secretary. 
According to Fox Business Network , Trump¡¯s confidence in winning the White House has fomented enough to begin picking Cabinet members, and besides the anomalous choice of Mnuchin for the Treasury, sources said he¡¯s considering New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for Attorney General and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for Homeland Security Secretary. 
Trump has, of course, expended great efforts in criticizing opponent Hillary Clinton¡¯s deep ties to the banking and Wall Street elite; and prior to garnering the Republican nomination, extended that critique to competitor Ted Cruz, saying in one debate: 
¡°I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.¡±

So who nearly killed whom in Reno, Nevada on Saturday night? 
A fracas at a Donald Trump rally captured on live television Saturday night saw the Republican candidate whisked off the stage by Secret Service agents and left those watching perplexed by what happened in the front rows as police in military gear appeared on the scene with one man ultimately led away by officials. 
But while one of his sons joined another top campaign aide in ¡° irresponsibly ¡± and falsely suggesting it was an assassination attempt against Trump, the man at the center of the incident says that all he did was hold up a sign reading ¡°Republicans Against Trump¡± before being tackled and beaten by those around him at the rally. 
Speaking with the Guardian following the event, the man, who identified himself as Austyn Crites from Reno, said it was the hysteria of his fellow Republicans at the rally¡ªand incitement by the presidential candidate himself¡ªwhich turned a simple gesture of dissent into a much more dangerous situation. Watch protester relives Trump fans¡¯ attack at Nevada rally: 
¡°I just went with sign that said ¡®Republicans Against Trump,'¡± Crites told the Reno Gazette-Journa l . ¡°It¡¯s a sign that you can find online. I held up the sign and initially people around me were just booing me telling me to get out of there. Then a couple of these guys tried grabbing the sign out of my hands.¡± He said he had no intentions other than to let his opinion be known. He expected to be booed and perhaps led away, but not pummeled nearly to death. 
¡°Multiple people just tackled me down, kicking me choking me and just beating me up,¡± he said. ¡°That¡¯s when things even got crazier. I was on the ground and people were holding my arms, legs and I kept saying I can barely breathe. I was turning my neck just to get a little bit of air to keep from passing out.¡± The police, he said, intervened just in time. 
According to the Guardian : The 33-year-old ¨C who says he has been a registered Republican for about six years ¨C said he was kicked, punched and choked, and feared for his life when the crowd turned on him at the gathering in Reno, Nevada . Crites cited Trump¡¯s treatment of Mexicans, Muslims and women as the reason he decided to protest again Trump, who he described as ¡°a textbook version of a dictator and a fascist¡±. There were panicked scenes at the Trump rally, apparently prompted by shouts from at least one person in the crowd that the protester had a gun. Hundreds of people fled to the the back of the auditorium in panic as Trump was hurriedly rushed from the stage by his security detail. 
As the following clip of the unfolding incident shows, Trump acknowledges someone in the crowd during his remarks, saying, ¡°Oh we have one of those guys from the Hillary Clinton campaign. How much are you being paid, $1,500?¡± As the crowd begins to agitate and boo, Trump then says, ¡°Okay. Take him out.¡± Just seconds later, as the scuffle appears to intensify, is when agents quickly approach Trump and take him off stage. Watch Donald Trump Rushed Off Stage by Secret Service: After Crites was removed from the event by security and police, Trump returned to the stage and told his supporters. ¡°No one said it would be easy.¡± 
Though Republicans and Trump supporters on social media overnight were calling him a ¡°thug¡±¡°infiltrator¡± and ¡°Clinton shill,¡± Crites posted a Facebook message (subsequently deleted) which said he has nothing official to do with the Clinton campaign, though he is supporting the Democratic candidate this year over Trump and has donated to her campaign. 
¡°Take what happened to me tonight,¡± Crites wrote to his fellow Republicans in the post, ¡°as a classic example of dictator incitement of violence ¡ª against your own Republican brother with a stupid sign.¡± This work by Common Dreams is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 International License.

For me, as a non U.S. person, the major issues of the U.S. presidential elections is always foreign policy. There Trump is not hawkish at all. He has somewhat confused, unlearned blustering positions on foreign policy but is basically a cautious, risk averse businessman. He consistently criticizes the war mongering in Washington DC. Hillary Clinton is a run-of-the-mill warmongering neoconservative compatible with the imperial ""mainstream"" of the power centers in Washington and elsewhere. 
Trump has called up this contrast again and again (as do I ). In a speech (vid at 53:20 min) in Grand Rapids Michigan on October 31 he again highlights these points. Some excerpts (taken from this partial transcript part 9, 10): Hillary led us to disaster in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya. ... Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it¡¯s worse than it¡¯s ever been before. 
Had Obama and others gone to the beach, Obama could have gone to the golf course, we would have been in much better shape. 
We shouldn¡¯t have gone into the war, and she thinks I¡¯m a hawk. Oh, Donald Trump. ... Imagine if some of the money had been spent, $6 trillion in the Middle East, on building new schools and roads and bridges right here in Michigan. 
Now Hillary, trapped in her Washington bubble, that¡¯s blind to the lessons, wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with a nuclear armed Russia that could drag us into a World War III. 
Okay, folks. She ¨C I¡¯ll tell you what. She will get us into World War III. She will get us into World War III. I will tell you that. She¡¯s incompetent. She will get us into World War III. 
The arrogant political class never learns. They keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again. They keep telling the same lies. They keep producing the same failed results. 
Trump may well be lying when he says he does not seek a conflict with Russia or anyone else. Trump surely lies on other issues. But those are mostly rather obvious lies and some are even a bit comical. He is playing Reagan on economic issues, promising tax cuts that can not be financed (and which Reagan had to take back in the end when he introduced the biggest tax hike ever). On many issues we do not know what Trump is really planning to do (or if he plans at all). But he has never given the impression that he is hawkish or willing to incite a war. 
Clinton on the other hand has a proven record of being a proactive hawk. She is willing to go to war and to kill people because the U.S. can. bigger 
She is a political animal totally dependent on her sponsors. Economically she is pro-banks, pro-big-business and for further deregulation. A neoliberal. The only ""liberal"" standpoints she has are on some hyped identity issues relevant only for a very tiny group of people like transgenders. She told her real voters, the people who pay her, that her public standpoint on many issues is different from the one she will pursue. She did not mean that what she will pursue will be less hawkish than her public stand, or that she will be more progressive on economic issues than she openly claims. 
Clinton assures us that Trump is Putin's puppet who will start a nuclear World War III with Russia. She doesn't say how that computes. Will Putin order Trump to give him asylum in Washington while Moscow and Washington get nuked? 
With Trump the U.S. would get a president who is a pretty unknown factor but, in my judgment, a less dangerous one to the U.S. and the world than Clinton. With her the next useless and deadly wars are practically guaranteed. 
Micah Zenko , who's opinion I value, agrees with my diagnose, Trump is less hawkish , but has a different judgement: When it comes to foreign policy, Trump¡¯s own positions make him the most immoral, poorly informed, and dangerous presidential candidate in recent American history. 
If Clinton is elected, there will undoubtedly be troubling foreign-policy positions and actions which must be thoroughly questioned and scrutinized. I just deeply hope that citizens have the opportunity to hold a President Hillary Clinton to account. 
The citizens of the United States now have an opportunity to hold Secretary of State Clinton to account for her "" We came, we saw, he died "" war on Libya and for escalating the war on Syria. The militaristic (and failed) pivot to Asia, the ""regime changes"" putsches in Honduras and Ukraine and the deterioration of relations with Russia are also to a large part her work. Should the voters reward her for all the death, misery and new dangers she created as Secretary of State by making her President? 
Who would I vote for? Not Hillary. Not for Trump either. Some third party candidate - probably Stein of the Green Party. It would be a ""useless and wasted"" vote in the short term though such votes have some light influence on the programs of the big parties. In the long term the example of voting third parties will hopefully induce more people to do the same. If it becomes a more common, regular thing to do it might over time break the duopoly of today's consensus in Washington. It is a small chance, but possibly a big long-term reward.   3, 2016 at 03:22 PM | Permalink",english,2016-11-04T00:20:09.369+02:00,moonofalabama.org,US,,Reward Clinton's Hawkishness Because Trump's Foreign Policy Is Uncertain?,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

People have now learned and accepted that Trump is inevitably the new president of the United States. They try to figure out what that means. We do not know, neither does anyone else. A lot of rumors and speculation are circling of who will take up this or that job in a Trump administration. These rumors are mostly created by those who would like that job, or their personal lobbies. They should be ignored. 
The mainstream media is barely able to issue a mea culpa for their extreme pro-Clinton campaign and total failure of reporting the real state of the union. It is now looking for obfuscations like claiming no one could have gotten it right. That is a cheap excuse for incompetence. 
It is astonishing that THE media outlet that did the most to shine lights on Clinton is ignored in any of the main stream after-election reporting. I am talking of Wikileaks and Julian Assange who did their very best, under high personal risk, to report the truth about Clinton's and the DNC's utter corruption. A big thank you to them! 
Clinton in her very late concession speech, found no words for her culpability or that of the campaign she ran. But the loss of the running is her personal failure. The ""bernie bros"" and ""deplorables"" thanked her hostility by not showing up to vote. She had 6 million votes less than Obama while Trump got about the same number as Romney! Instead of focusing on Trump's disastrous economic program she ran a warmongering ""blame Putin"" campaign. Her economic program was tinkering on the margins of the neoliberal status quo. Certainly not what voters in difficult financial situations, and there are a lots of those in today's U.S., needed to hear. There are now attempts to get Clinton pardoned for breaking classification laws and rules with her private email server as well as for her tax cheating, private slush fund ""charity"", the Clinton Foundation. If the Democrats want to keep at least some appearance of uprightness they should fight all such attempts. Let her pay a very heft penalty for her shenanigans. 
  apparatus is corrupt and was completely on Clinton's side. It cost the party the presidency as well as the House and any progress in the Senate. I find it very likely that Sanders would have won the primaries if the party apparatus had acted as neutral as it should have. He had a much better chance of beating Trump. With Sanders as candidate in the general election House and Senate seats would have been easier to keep or to win. There is an urgent and thorough cleanup needed in the party from top to bottom. Sanders should be given the lead of the party and be tasked to again win a majority in the House and/or Senate in the 2018 midterm election. 
Trumps true program will now come to the fore. A lot of stuff he said during the campaign will soon be forgotten. His economic program is a repeat of Reaganomics with a dose of isolationism in trade. How that is going to work out with the pivot to Asia and countering China is a mystery . His stand against Muslims was fake, as he let the embassies of the Gulf states know early on. 
The military will get more money for lots of funny programs. That is nothing new. It just build some $7.5 billion a piece battleships solely for their new, very special guns which now will not be used because their special ammunition is, at $800,000 a shot, too expensive. A total waste of money but at least it paid for some good jobs. (More jobs could have been created with that money in more important, non-military programs.) 
Trump will cut taxes for big enterprises and the rich. He will cut social programs. The general budget will go deep into red. In a few years he will have to, just like Reagan, increase taxes to regain some budget balance. 
His campaign unleashed a new wave of racism. Racism had not vanished - indeed it was very much in the open during Obama's time. But open hostile incidents against ""the other"" will probably increase. It will be difficult and take some time to reign it in again. 
It will be important to oppose Trump as much as possible. He is a somewhat megalomaniac and he currently has party majorities in both houses. He will have to be taught that not everything he tries is good or even possible. Trump will want a reelection and another four years as president. He can face opposition on the ground, from people who voted for him, if those people can see a plausible alternative . Clintonian tinkering on the edges of the status quo is no such alternative. There needs to be broad stroke economic policy, plausible and explainable, that offers a better world to them. If the Democrats, or a third party, can develop and present such a program there is good chance that the era of Trump will be a short unremarkable chapter in the history books.   10, 2016 at 02:09 PM | Permalink",english,2016-11-11T02:27:31.554+02:00,moonofalabama.org,US,,"Next Steps: Clean Up The Democratic Party, Oppose Trump",0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

The people loyal to the Syrian government are happy with Donald Trump winning the U.S. election: At the passport counter, a Syrian officer¡¯s face lit up when he saw an American traveler. 
¡°Congratulations on your new president!¡± he exclaimed, giving an energetic thumbs up. Mr. Trump, he said, would be ¡°good for Syria.¡± 
The first significant step of the new administration comes while Trump is not even in offices. Obama, selfishly concerned with his historic legacy, suddenly makes a 180 degree turn and starts to implement Trump polices. Lets consider the initial position : Asked about Aleppo in an October debate with Clinton, Trump said it was a humanitarian disaster but the city had ""basically"" fallen. Clinton, he said, was talking in favor of rebels without knowing who they were. 
The rebels fighting Assad in western Syria include nationalists fighting under the Free Syrian Army banner, some of them trained in a CIA-backed program, and jihadists such as the group formerly known as the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. 
The Obama administration, through the CIA led by Saudi asset John Brennan, fed weapons, training and billions of dollars to ""moderate rebels"". These then turned around and either gave the CIA gifts to al-Qaeda in Syria (aka Jabhat al Nusra) or joined it themselves. The scheme was no secret at all and Russia as well as Syria pointed this out several times. The Russian foreign Minister Lavrov negotiated with the U.S. secretary of State Kerry who promised to separate the ""moderate rebels"" from al-Qaeda. But Kerry never delivered. Instead he falsely accuse Russia of committing atrocities that never happened. The CIA kept the upper hand within the Obama administration and continued its nefarious plans. 
That changed the day the president-elect Trump set foot into the White House. While Obama met Trump in the oval office, new policies, prepared beforehand, were launched. The policies were held back until after the election and would likely not have been revealed or implemented if Clinton had won. 
The U.S. declared that from now on it will fight against al-Qaeda in Syria: President Obama has ordered the Pentagon to find and kill the leaders of an al-Qaeda-linked group in Syria that the administration had largely ignored until now and that has been at the vanguard of the fight against the Syrian government, U.S. officials said. 
That shift is likely to accelerate once President-elect Donald Trump takes office. ... possibly in direct cooperation with Moscow . ...U.S. officials who opposed the decision to go after al-Nusra¡¯s wider leadership warned that the United States would effectively be doing the Assad government's bidding by weakening a group on the front line of the counter-Assad fight. ... Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and other Pentagon leaders initially resisted the idea of devoting more Pentagon surveillance aircraft and armed drones against al-Nusra. 
Ash Carter is, together with John Brennan, the major anti-Russian force in the Obama administration. He is a U.S. weapon industry promoter and the anti-Russia campaign, which helps to sell U.S. weapons to NATO allies in Europe, is largely of his doing. He saw al-Qaeda in Syria as a welcome proxy force against Russia. 
But Obama has now shut down that policy. We are not yet sure that this is for good but the above Washington Post account is not the only signal : The U.S. Department of the Treasury¡¯s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took action today to disrupt al-Nusrah Front¡¯s military, recruitment, and financing operations. Specifically, OFAC designated four key al-Nusrah Front leaders ¨C Abdallah Muhammad Bin-Sulayman al-Muhaysini , Jamal Husayn Zayniyah, Abdul Jashari, and Ashraf Ahmad Fari al-Allak ¨C pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, which targets terrorists and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism. ... These designations were taken in coordination with the U.S. Department of State, which today named Jabhat Fath al Sham as an alias of al-Nusrah Front ¨C al-Qa¡¯ida¡¯s affiliate in Syria. ... Abdallah Muhammad Bin-Sulayman al-Muhaysini was designated for acting for or on behalf of, and providing support and services to or in support of, al-Nusrah Front. 
This is a major change in U.S. policy. Nusra will from now on be on the run not only from Russian and Syrian attacks but also from the intelligence and military capabilities of the United States. 
The newly designated Al-Muhaysini, a Saudi cleric, is Nusra's chief ideologue in Syria. Some considered him the new Osama Bin-Laden. Here he is, on the left, arm in arm with chief al-Qaeda in Syria propagandist and ""journalist"" Hadi Abdullah. bigger 
Hadi Abdullah, friend of the designated al-Qaeda terrorist Muhaysini, just received the 2016 Press Freedom Price from the CIA/Soros financed ""regime change"" influence operation Reporters Without Borders. Might this mean that Hadi Abdullah is himself a CIA assets? He would not be the first such ""journalist"" in Syria. 
Obama, obviously as a direct consequence of the Trump election, now ordered the Pentagon to wage war on al-Qaeda in Syria just as the Russians do. This after five years of nearly unlimited U.S. support for al-Qaeda and its ""moderate"" Syrian affiliates. It is not yet know what new orders, if any, Obama gave to the CIA. Will the CIA follow these policies or will it (again) try to counter the Pentagon policies in Syria? It is unusual that the WaPo report above about this new direction includes no commenting voice from the CIA. Why is such missing? 
Russia and Syria will welcome the new Obama policies should they come to fruit on the ground. Hillary Clinton had planned and announced to widen the conflict in Syria and with Russia and Iran. Obama would surely not have acted against such policies if she had been elected. But with Trump winning and thereby a new policy on the horizon he now changed course to a direction that will provide ""continuity"" when Trump takes over. 
Not only is Trump kicking a black family out of its longtime limewashed home, he also ends U.S. government support for the disenfranchised Jihadis in Syria and elsewhere. This even months before taking office. He really is the menace we have all been warned about.

He is clearly willing to delegate legislation to Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. And even abroad, his instincts incline him to increase U.S. strength¡ªand to push back even against Russia if, as will surely happen, Putin double-crosses him. My guess is that sequester gets rolled back, as do lots of stupid regulations, and experiments in nudging and nagging Americans to behave the way progressives think they should.

I find the above very funny. How could that turncoat think he would be greeted by the Trump organization with anything but derision? Cohen believed he and his ilk would be welcome with candies and roses after insulting Trump in all major media? Who is the arrogant one in the above? 
Oh, by the way. Here is a headline from October 2013: President Obama to Republicans: I won. Deal with it . I do not remember Cohen, or anyone else, calling that ""arrogant"". 
While the papers are full of (badly) informed rumors about who will get this or that position in a Trump administration let's keep in mind that 90% of such rumors are just self promotions by people like Cohen who shill for the rumored job. That is why I will not write about John Bolton or Rudy Giuliani as coming Secretary of State. Both are possible (unqualified) candidates. But others are just as likely to get that position. We will only know who it is after the official release. 
Meanwhile Trump yesterday had a phonecall with the Russian President Putin. They discussed bilateral relations, Syria and fighting terrorism. Today the Russian and Syrian military started the long expected big campaign against the ""moderate"" al-Qaeda in east-Aleppo city and Idleb governate. Air strikes on east-Aleppo had been held back for 28 days. Today missiles and cruise missiles were launched against fixed targets and dozens of carrier and land launched airplanes attacked Nusra position on the various front and in its rear. Long range bombers flown from Russia joined the campaign. Trump seems to have voiced no objections to this offensive. 
The Russian military has upped its air defense in Syria. Additional to the S-400 system around its airport in Latakia seven S-300 systems were deployed as a screen against U.S. cruise missile attacks. These are joined by rehabilitated Syrian S-200 system and Pantsyr S-1 short range systems for point defense. This should be enough to deter any stupid idea the Pentagon hawks, or dumb neocons like Eliot Cohen, might have.

Clinton makes some twenty different issues or person responsible for her loss - everyone and everything except the DNC, her staff or herself. But a campaign that did just enough to get the states it thought it needed and not one bit more was going to lose no matter how much money it would spend. Shunning progressives and implausibly blaming Russia for her own mistakes did not help either. She failed as a candidate and politician. It is just as simple as that. But now another culprit responsible for her loss is rolled out. ""Fake news"" that somehow wasn't sorted out on social networks. 
But my personal impression was that there was more fake news about Trump than about Clinton. The NYT like most other mainstream media was so much off from reality that its publisher now wrote a letter to request that staff ""rededicate .. to the fundamental mission of .. journalism"". He thereby admits that the NYT had failed as a news organization. 
But there is no rededication, neither in the NYT nor elsewhere, that I can see. The fairy tales about and around Trump seem not to stop for a minute. It will be claimed in top headlines that Trump will make John Bolton or Rudy Giuliani Secretary of State, lunatic Frank Gaffney will be his advisor. Trump wants security clearances for his children! Of course hardly any the active promoters of such nonsense will put the official denials of these lies on top of their pages or mention them at all. Poltico today told me that Wall Street is celebrating the Trump win, implying that Clinton would have been much better. Trump received some $5 million in donations from the finance sector, Clinton received $105 million - guess why. 
Trump wants to abandon a No-First-Strike policy for U.S. nuclear weapons is one current scare (650 retweets!). That is a policy the U.S. never-ever had. Obama, like Clinton, rejected a NFS policy. How could Trump abandon it? Trumps wants to register all Muslims? The National Security Entry-Exit Registration System was introduced in 2002 and only applied to visitors and residents from majority Muslim countries. (In 2011 the system was replaced with a new one that practically has the same purpose.) The no-fly-lists are largely lists of Muslim - even four years old ones. Obama waged drone war in seven countries and bombed five. All were majority Muslim. So what please could Trump actually do to Muslim people that would be worse than what Bush or Obama have done? 
Trump is a racist and his voters are white supremacists is a fake news claim that is still rolled out on a daily base. The facts do not support it. If they were true why did he get more votes from blacks and hispanics than Romney or McCain? 
Why not take Trump for what he is? A fast talking salesman, born too rich, but politically a centrist who long supported Democrats and who will simply continue the political path Clinton, Bush and Obama created and walked before him. There is some hope that he will be less ""globalist"", neoconned and belligerent in his foreign policy but that still needs to be proven. On many of his announced policies there will likely be more Democrats in Congress supporting him than Republicans. 
The man should be attacked on his politics and policies whenever that is justified. There will plenty such opportunities, especially with his economic and tax plans. Instead we get a daily dose of fake news about Trump this or that and one scare story after the other. 
Is it so difficult, or even impossible, for journalists and media to ""rededicate"" themselves from feverish pro-Clinton and anti-Trump advocates back to (semi-)serious reporting? 
That would be bad news for everyone. Posted by b on November 17, 2016 at 01:25 PM | Permalink",english,2016-11-17T20:27:44.319+02:00,moonofalabama.org,US,,"""Fake News"" About Trump Continues Unabated",0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

If some investigative journos start digging into the issue this story could develop into a really interesting scandal: 
Pentagon and intelligence community chiefs have urged Obama to remove the head of the NSA The heads of the Pentagon and the nation¡¯s intelligence community have recommended to President Obama that the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, be removed. 
The recommendation, delivered to the White House last month, was made by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to several U.S. officials familiar with the matter. ... The news comes as Rogers is being considered by President-Elect Donald Trump to be his nominee for DNI, replacing Clapper as the official who oversees all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies. In a move apparently unprecedented for a military officer, Rogers, without notifying superiors, traveled to New York to meet with Trump on Thursday at Trump Tower. 
Adm. Michael S. Rogers recently claimed in reference to the hack of the Democratic National Council emails that Wikileaks spreading them is ""a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect."" He obviously meant Russia. 
Compare that with his boss James Clapper who very recently said (again) that the ""intelligence agencies don't have good insight on when or how Wikileaks obtained the hacked emails."" 
Emails of the DNC and of Clinton's consigliere John Podesta were hacked and leaked. Additionally emails from Clinton's private email server were released. All these influenced the election in favor of Trump. 
Wikileaks boss Assange says he does not know where the emails come from but he does not think they came from Russia. 
Clapper and Carter wanted Rogers fired because he was generally disliked at the NSA, because two big breaches in the most secret Tailored Access Organization occurred on his watch even after the Snowden case and because he blocked, with the help of Senator McCain, plans to split the NSA into a spying and a cyber war unit. 
Now let me spin this a bit. 
Rogers obviously knew he was on the to-be-fired list and he had good relations with the Republicans. 
Now follows speculation: 
Some Rogers trusted dudes at the NSA (or in the Navy cyber arm which Rogers earlier led) hack into the DNC, Podesta emails and the Clinton private email server. An easy job with the tools the NSA provides for its spies. Whoever hacked the emails then pushes what they got to Wikileaks (and DCleaks , another ""leak"" outlet). Wikileaks publishes what it gets because that is what it usually does. Assange also has various reasons to hate Clinton. She was always very hostile to Wikileaks. She allegedly even mused of killing Assange by a drone strike. 
Rogers then accuses Russia of the breach even while the rest of the spying community finds no evidence for such a claim. That is natural to do for a military man who grew up during the cold war and may wish that war (and its budgets) back. It is also a red herring that will never be proven wrong or right unless the original culprit is somehow found. 
Next we know - Trump offers Rogers the Clapper job. He would replace the boss that wanted him fired. 
Rogers support for the new cold war will also gain him favor with the various weapon industries which will eventually beef up his pension. 
Some of the above is speculation. But it would make sense and explain the quite one-sided wave of leaks we saw during this election cycle. 
Even if it isn't true it would at least be a good script for a Hollywood movie on the nastiness of the inside fighting in Washington DC. 
Let me know how plausible you find the tale.   19, 2016 at 02:14 PM | Permalink",english,2016-11-19T21:58:02.832+02:00,moonofalabama.org,US,,Speculation: Trump Promotes NSA Boss Rogers To DNI Because He Leaked The Clinton Emails,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

¡°Hail Hitler¡± and ¡°Heil Victory¡± ¨C do they eerily sound the same? It¡¯s because it is. Alt-Right groups are performing Nazi-like salutes for President-Elect Donald Trump. What is the Alt-Right? 
The Alt-Right consists of white supremacist groups most likely composed of college-educated white men upholding the superiority of their skin color and believing in every right-wing propaganda. 
Such groups have gone almost extinct under President Obama¡¯s administration, reduced to a few sites and pages on social media. However, they surfaced with renewed vigor after Donald Trump¡¯s victory in the 2016 elections. 
Their leader, Richard B. Spencer, emerged as something of a wannabe Adolf Hitler and is calling for his followers to take back the U.S. as theirs.

On November 20, a crowd of people gathered in front of the Ronald Reagan pavilion in Washington to listen to Spencer¡¯s speech. 
After quoting the Nazi propaganda in German, Spencer called the assembled white people ¡°children of the sun.¡± In his speech, he expressed the central idealism of the group ¨C that white-skinned Americans were born to conquer, not follow. 
The speech concluded with shouts of ¡°Heil the people! Heil victory!¡± The people had their arms stretched out in front of them, reported the New York Times . 
There was little doubt as to what Spencer meant when he reiterated the belief that white-skinned Americans should not live in the shadows anymore. That the time had come for their ¡°awakening to their own identity.¡±

During his Presidential campaign, Trump¡¯s demeanor and discourse were equated with the most notorious leader of all time, Hitler. However, after his victory, his cabinet choices are leaving little to the imagination. 
Trump has picked Steve Bannon, founder of the Breitbart website, to be his strategist. Breitbart is widely known to to be a platform for alt-right news. 
What¡¯s more, Richard Spencer expressed that he is looking forward to Bannon shaking things up in the White House. 
The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum vehemently condemned the ¡°hateful rhetoric¡± spreading throughout the nation.

There are other instances of alt-right supporters celebrating Trump¡¯s victory in a Nazi-esque fashion. 
A restaurant called Little Italy in Washington D.C. recently issued an apology for mistakenly hosting a banquet for a group called National Policy Institute (NPI), reported CBS News . Apparently, the group had tweeted a photo of some of their members giving a Nazi-salute to Donald Trump . 
¡°This expression of support of Hitler is extremely offensive to us, as our restaurant is home to Teammates and Guests of every race, religion and cultural background,¡± said the restaurant on its Facebook page .

Lambert here: Howard Dean, back in 2003 and before he lost his mind, said : ¡°I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks. We can¡¯t beat George Bush unless we appeal to a broad cross-section of Democrats.¡± Of course, such a gross violation of liberal class and cultural markers could not be permitted, and Dean was forced to grovel and apologize by the dominant identitarian wing of the Democrat Party and then, when his fifty-state strategy won Democrats control of Congress in 2006, instantly defenestrated by Rahm Emanuel, among others, and his organization gutted by Tim Kaine . When Chomsky asks ¡°Why are we failing to organize these people?¡± he¡¯s asking a question to which Dean already gave the answer. 
Clinton, of course, thinks that organizing ¡°these people¡± is a bad idea, which is why she called them ¡°deplorable¡± and ¡°irredeemable¡± (and if you¡¯re a Christian, as Clinton purports to be, ¡°irredeemable¡± means irredeemable). So do many of her supporters, who seem to labor under the twin delusions that (a) ¡°these people¡± will go away on the morning of November 9, and that (b) calling them, in various ways, stupid is, as a strategy, full of #win. If Clinton wishes to fail during a legitimacy crisis, she and her supporters should go on exactly as they have begun. Personally, I¡¯m not a ¡°worse is better¡± guy (too much suffering), but I confess I see little prospect of the dominant faction in the Democrat Party changing its ways, Dean, Chomsky, or no. 
By Alexandra Rosenmann, AlterNet associate editor. Originally published in Alternet . 
In the past 15 months, Noam Chomsky has weighed in on the U.S. presidential race often. 
¡°There are differences in the parties,¡± he said in February, when asked if he¡¯d even consider a Republican over Hillary Clinton. ¡°Small differences [coupled with] great power can have enormous consequences.¡± 
Chomsky initally favored Sanders over Clinton, but insisted Democrats must win at all costs. Because according to Chomsky , if Trump wins ¡°the human species is in very deep trouble. 
But as for Trump¡¯s supporters, Chomsky¡¯s not counting them out just yet. 
¡°I¡¯m basically judging by what I see and read about them listening to talk radio and so on,¡± Chomsky admitted of the protests on the right. ¡°But my strong impression is that these [right-wing protesters] are people with very real grievances.¡± 
¡°They give the impression of being a hard-working serious people who think they¡¯ve been doing everything right. They¡¯ve been doing what they¡¯re ¡®supposed¡¯ to do [as] god-fearing hard-working, gun-carrying, you know patriotic, Americans,¡± Chomsky continued. 
¡°What are they doing wrong and how come their lives are so crummy?¡± Chomsky asked. 
It¡¯s a question that has plagued the election. 
¡°They¡¯re not getting answers,¡± Chomsky insisted. ¡°The answers they are getting are not only crazy, but extremely dangerous, so the right response is to ask ourselves, why are we failing to organize these people?¡± 
There¡¯s nothing partisan about losing money to Wall Street or lacking health insurance; issues at the forefront of protests from both sides for nearly a decade. 
¡°We have not succeeded in unifying people,¡± Chomsky noted. ¡°It¡¯s our fault.¡±

Jerri-Lynn here: There are many reasons to despair at the choice US voters face in tomorrow¡¯s election. The danger that either candidate will goad Russia or China, without respect to consequences, is perhaps the most immediate and frightening. While many media hounds chase the false scent of alleged Russian manipulation of Trump, the election, and Wikileaks, to name just a few of the crazy allegations being discussed, this more serious threat has not been pursued nearly as vigorously. 
In this Real News Network interview , journalist John Pilger and TRNN¡¯s Paul Jay discuss why the very real prospect of another World War is not taken seriously by the US media. Pilger argues that whoever is elected, tensions with China and Russia will escalate. I tidied up the rush transcript as best I could. Please excuse any remaining errors. 
PAUL JAY, TRNN: Welcome to the Real News Network. I?¡¯m Paul Jay. 
In a few days, Americans are going to decide who the next President of the United States is going to be. Of course, this is an issue of global concern, given that the United States considers itself hegemon of the world and acts that way. What will be the difference perhaps is the foreign policy of the next President, whatever it is, Clinton or Trump. Based on what we?¡¯ve seen the last few years and how does one assess all of this? I think we?¡¯re assessing the degree of danger to the world. There doesn¡¯?t seem to be any other measurement here. 
Now joining us to discuss all of this is John Pilger. John joins us from London. John is an award- winning very celebrated filmmaker and journalist. His films have been broadcast on major broadcast platforms and channels around the world. His latest film is The Coming War on China , which will be released in December. Thanks very much for joining us John. 
JOHN PILGER: You?¡¯re welcome. 
JAY: So as I said in the opening, it?¡¯s a kind of a question of who is more dangerous. There does?n¡¯t seem to be any question. I think in most thinking people?s minds that one way or the other, US foreign policy is going to be dangerous for people of the world, particularly in the Middle East but not only. What is your assessment in this moment? 
PILGER: Well it?¡¯s always dangerous. I sometimes think that it?¡¯s extraordinary I?¡¯ve gotten to this stage in life and I haven¡¯?t been blown up by US foreign policy. But so we all of us outside the US quake before a US election. That said, the US isn?¡¯t run by presidents, it?¡¯s run by a vast national security machine and that hasn¡¯?t changed in the last 15 years or so. I think the other 2 candidates. One is clearly a rogue candidate and that?¡¯s Donald Trump and the other, Hillary Clinton, is the candidate of this vast national security machine. 
I think what?¡¯s been a pity for all of us outside the United States and indeed for all Americans, is that the hysteria over Donald Trump has obscured the fact that Hillary Clinton may well turn out to be one of the more dangerous presidents, assuming she does win as the polls suggest, though she may not of course. Because she is the president. She is almost the embodiment of a status quo that since 9/11 has left us all in a very precarious state. It?¡¯s left the Middle East in a precarious state. But above all, it?¡¯s brought us to the brink of some kind of very serious confrontation with Russia and the taunting of Russia, the intimidation of Russia is now unabated and just over the horizon there is a similar baiting of the other great nuclear power, China. 
Now this issue which of course amounts to the prospect of another world war, even another nuclear war, have not been touched on. 
Well they have been touched on. Ironically in the first debate, Donald Trump was asked about this and he said words to the effect, words that I would not go nuclear. I would not do a first strike. This was?n¡¯t used. It was?n¡¯t published. Now I would?¡¯ve thought for whatever it¡¯?s worth, he might not have meant it. Trump says a lot of things he does?n¡¯t mean. Contradicts himself. But I would?¡¯ve thought that difference between Trump and Clinton on the issue of nuclear war, of war and peace was pretty critical. At least an issue to be debated. But it wasn?¡¯t. 
JAY: Yeah, the American media is totally involved in this salacious part of Trump?¡¯s history and as usual, not very interested in any issues of polices of substance. You can find things on both of these candidates that would give one the chills. Starting with Trump, the great danger of Trump is that it won?¡¯t be President Trump, it will be President Pence. Pence has been asked who he?¡¯s going to model his Vice Presidency after and he says Cheney and in terms of foreign policy outlook, there seems to be no difference between him and Cheney. 
PILGER: Well, what?¡¯s the difference between any of them frankly? I mean neocon is a terrible word but it describes them all. Trump is perhaps more interesting because he seems to have upset all the establishment. The CIA wants him beaten, the Pentagon wants him beaten, the State Department wants him beaten, even his own party wants him beaten. I mean something recommends him and just his enemies do. So, whether there is a difference I think there?¡¯s a difference of that much. I do emphasize this, that as you mentioned all these salacious stories about Trump but you know what do people want? Do they want to hear salacious stories or do they want to hear about the prospects of war and peace? Do they want to hear about whether we?¡¯re entering an extremely dangerous period in relation to Russia or not? 
These issues have not been addressed and I don?¡¯t think there?s any doubt that Clinton who has very unusually named a cabinet already in a sense and a very good article by one of the independent journalists in Washington, Gareth Porter, listed these people and they?¡¯re all war hawks. And she said it in the last debate. I?m going to have a no-fly zone in Syria. That means attacking Russian planes. 
JAY: I think there?¡¯s no doubt whichever of these people get elected president, in spite of Trump?¡¯s rhetoric and if you look at what Pence says, I think both Clinton and I will say a Pence Trump, and I put Pence first because I think that¡¯s the more likely scenario, are going to be looking for provocations with Russia. Both Clinton and Pence are using Russian rhetoric to try and engage but using more than rhetoric. There?¡¯s this very interesting WikiLeaks that I don?¡¯t think has received nearly enough attention which shows something about the State Department under Clinton?¡¯s mentality. 
It said in the WikiLeaks that it?¡¯s not said who it?¡¯s to or from but when I asked some of the people we know who have some expertise in this, they say it sounds like a State Department briefing. It says to get the Israelis in support or not in active opposition to the Iran deal we need to get rid of Assad. And essentially¨C and one assumes the reason for getting that will please Israel is to undermine Hezbollah¨C but it kind of shows what drives a lot of State Department thinking and I don¡¯?t think it?¡¯s a big stretch to think it drives Clinton thinking. 
PILGER: Yeah, well, she hasn¡¯?t hidden it. She?¡¯s had an obsequious relationship with Israel¨C it¡¯s well known. Her tough talking, her militarist talking, is all out there in the open. She?¡¯s made it clear that she?¡¯s going to face off Vladimir Putin. She?¡¯s going to talk tough to the Chinese. As a kind of insanity about all this. I mean US foreign policy is actually run in a straight line since 1945. But it¡¯s become more extreme in the last 10-15 years. That?¡¯s what worries most of us outside the United States and ought to worry those of you in the United States that it?¡¯s become so extreme now. So extreme that the prospect of an accidental war at the very least. Here we are at centenaries of the first world war where all the lessons of there are glaring out at us of not quite accidental war. Intended war that lit up and became a slaughter partly by accident. I don?¡¯t for a moment think that this verbose provocateur who is currently the Defense Secretary, Mr. Carter, who is forever shouting his militarist slogans around the world. I don?¡¯t for a moment think that he actually wants nuclear war. But he sure is trying to bring it on. I?¡¯ve never known anything quite like his constant aggression. And this campaign of sending out these admirals and generals. Like Admiral Harry Harris in the Pacific speaking like Lord Palmerston in the 19th century. You know how much he runs from the world. You know what you say from Bollywood to Hollywood. You know these rather absurd people but with very great power. 
JAY: The overall agenda of American dominance I don?¡¯t think changes much between the various administrations or parties. But do you not think sometimes individual and specific agendas within the complexity of the America elites plays a role? I?¡¯ll give you a couple examples. First of all, Cheney clearly drove the Iraq war. John Kiriakou, the former CIA agent said there was a morning meeting with the heads of all the major agencies and top Pentagon officials in the year leading up to the Iraq War and that that completely quite out of the ordinary, that morning phone call was chaired by Dick Cheney. And that in that phone call, and Kiriakou was apparently on it sometimes with some of the CIA people, most of the heads of agencies, most of the officialdom of the military complex were against invading Iraq. Cheney actually threatened these people saying resign or do what you?¡¯re ordered to. 
There are times when specific agendas can take hold. Like for example the people I guess that what the Real News, they heard us talk about Project for New American Century often enough. The very far right type of agenda. The other one where I think it did make a difference is if you look at the Obama-McCain election. This is not to say Obama has not been aggressive and has not committed war crimes because he has. On the other hand, this is John ?Bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran? McCain and Obama does make a deal with Iran. I mean there are differences within these corridors of power which are sometimes important are there not? 
PILGER: Obama decided not to attack Iran. I don?¡¯t know about making a deal with Iran. They decided not to attack Iran. Attacking Iran would?¡¯ve been a disaster of course for the people of Iran and in the Middle East. But it would?¡¯ve also been a disaster for the United States. 
JAY: As the Iraq War was. 
PILGER: He decided not to attack them. So yes, but Obama has run probably more wars simultaneously than any other president. He?¡¯s run probably the most comprehensive terror campaign in his drone warfare of assassination. You know we can sit here and say that one is slightly better. 
JAY: I would?n¡¯t even use the word better. I would say in specific circumstances. 
PILGER: I was searching. I was going to say less insane than the other. Sure. But in the end, here we are in 2016 in a presidential campaign and I¡¯ve covered 4 US presidential campaigns and I thought no you could?n¡¯t have Nixon as president. Well looking back on Nixon compared with some of the others who have come since, maybe a little less insane there. I don?¡¯t know. But here we are in 2016 with this political freak show in the United States that spells great danger for all of us. 
JAY: John talk a little bit about the film you¡¯re working on and why you think there¡¯s such a looming confrontation with China, what?¡¯s driving it? 
PILGER: Well it?¡¯s not what I think. The evidence is very clear. I mean Obama, the one who?¡¯s done the deals, he?s announced that he went to Australia in 2011 and announced what was known as the pivot to Asia and that was the deployment, the transfer of almost two-thirds of US naval forces into the Asia Pacific region by the year 2020. And at the moment there are 400 US bases ringing China. They start in Australia and they go all the way through Asia, up through the Pacific, Korea, Japan, across Eurasia, Afghanistan, India. If you look at them on a map, you can understand why the Chinese have apparently changed their nuclear policy to a first strike policy. They never had that. They used to keep the missiles and warheads separate. They don?¡¯t anymore. 
In the informed literature, the Journal of Concerned Scientists and there have been a number of articles that have described in some detail how the Chinese have changed their nuclear profile. They¡¯re worried. I was there not long ago and I spoke to a number of strategists and people are worried¨C rather confused actually¨C but worried and some of them are quite angry. The whole building of air strips on the Spratly and Paracel Islands in the South China Sea was a defensive move. Last year the United States conducted possibly the biggest naval exercise in history. Talisman Saber in which it rehearsed a blockade across the Malacca Straits through which comes 80% of China?¡¯s oil and its raw materials. 
The Chinese understand all of this. They know all of this. If it?¡¯s not explained to us through our media, they certainly know about it. This kind of provocation against China has been almost, I would?n¡¯t say a sideshow but it?¡¯s another chapter. The first chapter of course is the provocation of Russia. And that is probably the most dangerous. Does anyone in the United States know what the Russians are thinking? What people in Russia are thinking? That they?¡¯re having civil drill exercises. What the Russian press is saying? What people think about this? 
There is a sense in much of Russia that the United States is about to attack them. This is very, very dangerous because it puts a country in a defensive position, and that?¡¯s when accidents can happen. There is no debate about this in what is it? Constitutionally the free-est place in the world, in the United States? Nothing. Read the New York Times for the last couple of days. It?¡¯s become a sort of Cold War propaganda sheet. Stories that are clearly nonsense. 
JAY: The objective seems to be one would think to weaken Putin but if anything?¡¯s going to strengthen Putin it?¡¯s this kind of threat that creates an increased amount of nationalism and such. 
PILGER: Well I don?¡¯t know if it will strengthen Putin at all. I don?¡¯t know enough about Russia. But the little I do know suggests that Putin is one of those who is always talking about being a partner of the United States. He does want to be a partner. He sees Russia?¡¯s future in Europe. There are others in Russia who have had enough of the talk of partnership and who drink in a deep well of Russian nationalism and Russian memory of all their great invasions of their country. So, I don?¡¯t know whether it strengthens Putin or not. Perhaps it does?n¡¯t. Whatever it is, it?¡¯s dangerous. 
JAY: You mean in other ways it could be strengthening far more nationalists and fascistic forces that could actually- 
PILGER: Well not fascistic. In fact, there are plenty of fascists in Ukraine. You would?n¡¯t know that reading the US press. There was a coup in 2014. Fascist led. Paid for by the United States. The truth of that is inverted and it has Russia invading Ukraine. I mean couldn¡¯?t make it up but that?¡¯s the received wisdom. Now I¡¯?m not sure about the fascistic elements in Russia but there could be militarist elements and there could be those in the very powerful national security sector in Russia that say we have to prepare and they are preparing of course. Their weapons industry has been developing in a very sophisticated way in the last few years. Their air defenses and so on. But this is all war preparation. You know whether it?¡¯s Clinton or Trump it?¡¯s deeply worrying and deeply disturbing when reckless politicians like Hillary Clinton can stand up and beat every war drum that is put in front of them. That¡¯?s reckless.

By Nick Cunningham, a Vermont-based writer on energy and environmental issues. You can follow him on twitter at @nickcunningham1. Originally published at OilPrice 
Donald Trump¡¯s victory could ultimately lead to a lot more oil pipelines moving forward, one sector of the fossil fuel industry specifically targeted by environmentalists. 
The most controversial project right now, the Dakota Access Pipeline, received a jolt from Tuesday¡¯s result. The more than 1,100-mile pipeline, valued at $3.7 billion, would carry oil from North Dakota to refineries in Illinois. The Obama administration has requested a temporary halt to construction, although the company behind the project, Energy Transfer Partners, has pressed forward, ignoring the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps reiterated a request for a stoppage this week, but the outcome is up in the air. 
The Dakota Access Pipeline has been reeling from protests, work stoppages, bad press and a federal government willing to listen to the grievances from the Native American community affected. Trump has shown little inclination of being as accommodating, so the Dakota Access Pipeline has gone from being a project on the ropes to one with a great deal of momentum. Unless the Corps rescinds a permit in the next few months, the project will move forward. Even if it is blocked, however, it would likely be revived under a Trump administration. Energy Transfer Partners¡¯ stock price surged as much as 9 percent on Wednesday and was up more than 3 percent on Thursday. The company hopes to complete construction by the first quarter of 2017. 
And Dakota Access¡¯ predecessor, at least in terms of a national flashpoint, could also be coming back from the dead. TransCanada issued a statement on Wednesday, telegraphing the company¡¯s interest in reviving the defunct Keystone XL Pipeline, which would take Alberta tar sands to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. ¡°TransCanada remains fully committed to building Keystone XL,¡± spokesman Mark Cooper said in the post-election statement. ¡°We are evaluating ways to engage the new administration on the benefits, the jobs and the tax revenues this project brings to the table.¡± TransCanada¡¯s stock price jumped more than 2 percent on Wednesday. 
During the campaign Trump said that he supported the pipeline, but wanted the U.S. to get a ¡°better deal.¡± His words are often conflicting and contradictory ¨C he has also said that he is for an ¡°America First¡± energy plan that would remove ¡°all barriers to responsible energy production.¡± So there is no reason to think that he wouldn¡¯t simply revive the project as is, especially given that he is surrounding himself with advisors from the oil and gas industry. 
Beyond these two projects, the oil industry is hoping for broader easing of permitting and regulations on pipeline construction. The Army Corps under Trump could clear the way for energy infrastructure, downgrading its scrutiny of the effects on rivers and lakes from oil pipelines. ¡°We¡¯re hopeful the pipeline approval process will now be allowed to work without political interference,¡± John Stoody, vice president of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, told E&E News. And with plans to dismantle much of the EPA, the ability to break ground and lay down pipeline could get a whole lot easier. 
While Trump supports the Keystone XL Pipeline, his presidency complicates things for Canada a bit. For one, he wants to renegotiate NAFTA. But leaving that aside, the resuscitation of Keystone XL could create problems for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was thought to be nearing an approval for the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion, which would take Alberta oil to the Pacific Coast. It is not obvious that both the Keystone XL Pipeline and Kinder Morgan¡¯s Trans Mountain Pipeline both need to be built.

Alberta¡¯s Premier is not ready to put all her eggs in one basket by trusting that the pathway to Canada¡¯s south for oil will be cleared up. ¡°We must continue to work to diversity Canada¡¯s energy markets, and to build trading relationships with more than one buyer,¡± Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said in a statement following Trump¡¯s victory. ¡°For that reason, a Canadian pipeline to tidewater remains an important priority for Alberta.¡± 
Finally, the environmental movement has been left shocked and terrified over what a Trump administration would mean for the environment, but they have vowed not to give an inch. ¡°I think they will greenlight lots of fossil fuel projects,¡± Jane Kleeb, a key activist fighting the Keystone XL Pipeline in Nebraska, told E&E News . ¡°And we¡¯ll fight all of them.¡± 0 0 0 0 0 0",english,2016-11-11T13:16:45.607+02:00,nakedcapitalism.com,US,54210,Trump To Clear Way For Oil Pipelines,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Or does he truly know something most of us don't know?In a recent column , Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, says that Soros and Democrats have ""bribed electoral college representatives"" in a bid to ""fix"" the election outcome in favor of Clinton. In truth, that would be the only way it could be done, short of massive voter fraud through electronic balloting, as some reports have already claimed .Adams further pointed out that Soros was one of the main money men behind the Black Lives Matter movement, which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country ¨C some of which has led to the deaths of several officers already.Soros also funds left-wing websites and groups that locate, pay and deploy volunteer ""agitators"" at Trump rallies, to start fights and engage in physical violence against Trump supporters (acts that the establishment media then blames on Trump ).But aren't electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that elector's district? No, they're not. Nine-nine percent of electors have done what they're supposed to do throughout our history, but this is no ordinary election Per Archives.gov , there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote. Rather, these pledges fall into two categories: State law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political parties.In the past, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution doesn't require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please and, therefore, respective political parties may ""extract pledges from electors to vote for the parties' nominees,"" Archives.gov notes. Some state laws hold that ""faithless electors"" could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid ballot, and could then be replaced by a substitute elector.""The Supreme Court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the Constitution. No Elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged,"" said Archives.gov.The site notes that throughout our history, 99 percent of electors have voted as required. But this is no ordinary time, and it's no ordinary election . And Democrats (and the establishment media) have already proven that they will do anything to stop a Trump presidency. Plus, establishment Republicans don't want Trump either, so you can bet they wouldn't balk at or challenge the buying off of electors.

  Natural News Editors Tags: war on women , democrats , campaign tactic (NaturalNews) Single women are a crucial element of the Democrat constituency, pushed to the polls with a crude combination of scare tactics and pandering that would be comical if it wasn't so effective in election after election. We may pause to remark that Republicans should have been much more prepared for this in 2016, but we should also look back to 2012 because it was used in 2012, regardless of how absurd it was to suggest Mitt Romney was leading a ""War on Women.""(Article written by John Howard, republished from Breitbart.com )Even some liberals are recognizing the absurdity, given the emergence of ""Strange New Respect"" for Romney this year. Of course this new respect is pure political opportunism ¡ª and don't be surprised to hear liberals complaining in future election that the conservative Republican presidential candidate isn't as candid and relaxed about social issues as Donald Trump was in the good old days of 2016.We should practice a little political opportunism of our own, and put the Left's revised opinion of Romney to good use. What they said about him was absurd in almost every respect. They've wholeheartedly embraced his position on the geopolitical threat of Russia, which means they're tacitly admitting Barack Obama didn't know what the hell he was talking about. They razz Trump about not paying enough taxes, but they didn't care a whit that Romney paid stupendous amounts of tax, plus vast charitable contributions.Most pertinently, they turned Mitt Romney into a misogynist clod, and his wife Ann Romney into an out-of-touch Stepford Wife, on the thinnest of pretexts. Lefty polemicists today are acting like they were possessed by political demons when they spent the final weeks of the 2012 campaign shrieking about ""binders full of women ,"" and now they can't quite remember what they were going on about.As for Mrs. Romney, she was unceremoniously stripped of her feminine identity by liberals and treated like a space alien because she dared to endorse stay-at-home motherhood. When a mild backlash ensued, the White House memorably denied one of its slander ninja by claiming to know several different people with the same name. [1, 2]In the Democrat imagination and campaign ads, Republicans are constantly targeting American woman. You can draw a straight line from Anita Hill's hit on Clarence Thomas in the Nineties, to ""journalist"" George Stephanopoulos ambushing the Republican presidential field with a bizarre question about contraceptives in the 2012 primary.It's all pure opportunism, not principle. Romney was a choirboy, so they claimed his policies revealed his secret inner misogynist beast. Trump's policies include a family-leave plan, a culture-war cease-fire declared by Peter Thiel at the GOP convention, and an unease with late-term abortion that tracks with the majority of the country. There's precious little that could be twisted into a War on Women narrative, even by the people who used Sandra Fluke to portray spending ten bucks on contraceptives as the equivalent of female slavery. Therefore, the Left ignores Trump's policies and hits his character, while Bill Freakin' Clinton gets ready to move back into the White House.In the Nineties, Democrats argued that Clinton's sexual abuses had nothing to do with how he governed, so discussing them was a silly distraction we all needed to MoveOn.org from, even when he was in the dock for perjury. Liberals of that election cycle laughed out loud at the notion Bill Clinton's libido had any effect whatsoever on national policy. He was good for the abortion industry, so his treatment of actual women was irrelevant.Partisan feminism is at a strange crossroads, as the core feminist message of independence clashes with victim politics. Women are supposed to simultaneously feel strong, capable... and be utterly helpless before systemic male chauvinism. They can only achieve personal ""independence"" through total dependence on the Big Government, which is staffed and managed by the only men in America who supposedly aren't looking to exploit them. (You're not to think about the bureaucrats who keep getting caught surfing for pornography on government computers.) [3]The great left-wing project to rewire society in defiance of biology has saddled America with devastating social problems, but that's not a problem for the social engineers. Indeed, it's more of a feature than a bug.Everything from illegitimacy, to crime, to the enormous difficulty of raising children as a single mom becomes another opportunity for them to push increased government power on a fearful, atomized population, which is rapidly losing its ability to form non-government voluntary structures of enduring social value, such as thriving small businesses and stable marriages.The dirty little secret known to the Left all along, but denied vociferously by them until their plans were fully up and running, is that most of these societal changes hit women harder, due to everything from their voluntary career choices, to the realities of child-rearing.So in the world liberals have made, single women become more anxious than ever, about everything from campus rape to the ""implicit bias"" of a systematically misogynist workplace, and they rush to government for protection from the harms caused by that abusive government.Read more at: Breitbart.com",english,2016-10-28T09:33:59.057+03:00,naturalnews.com,US,6416,"Whether it's John McCain, Mitt Romney or Donald Trump, Democrats always run 'War on Women' tactic to destroy the Republican candidate",0,http://www.naturalnews.com/gallery/640/Business/Business-Women-Team-Happy-Victory.jpg,0,1,114,0,114,junksci,Negative

Monday, October 31, 2016 by: Natural News Editors (NaturalNews) I've been trying to figure out what common trait binds Clinton supporters together. As far as I can tell, the most unifying characteristic is a willingness to bully in all its forms.If you have a Trump sign in your lawn, they will steal it.If you have a Trump bumper sticker, they will deface your car.if you speak of Trump at work you could get fired.(Article republished from Dilbert.com )On social media, almost every message I get from a Clinton supporter is a bullying type of message. They insult. They try to shame. They label. And obviously they threaten my livelihood.We know from Project Veritas that Clinton supporters tried to incite violence at Trump rallies. The media downplays it.We also know Clinton's side hired paid trolls to bully online. You don't hear much about that.Yesterday, by no coincidence, Huffington Post, Salon, and Daily Kos all published similar-sounding hit pieces on me, presumably to lower my influence. (That reason, plus jealousy, are the only reasons writers write about other writers.)Joe Biden said he wanted to take Trump behind the bleachers and beat him up. No one on Clinton's side disavowed that call to violence because, I assume, they consider it justified hyperbole.Team Clinton has succeeded in perpetuating one of the greatest evils I have seen in my lifetime. Her side has branded Trump supporters (40%+ of voters) as Nazis, sexists, homophobes, racists, and a few other fighting words. Their argument is built on confirmation bias and persuasion. But facts don't matter because facts never matter in politics. What matters is that Clinton's framing of Trump provides moral cover for any bullying behavior online or in person. No one can be a bad person for opposing Hitler, right?Some Trump supporters online have suggested that people who intend to vote for Trump should wear their Trump hats on election day. That is a dangerous idea, and I strongly discourage it. There would be riots in the streets because we already know the bullies would attack. But on election day, inviting those attacks is an extra-dangerous idea. Violence is bad on any day, but on election day, Republicans are far more likely to unholster in an effort to protect their voting rights. Things will get wet fast.Yes, yes, I realize Trump supporters say bad things about Clinton supporters too. I don't defend the bad apples on either side. I'll just point out that Trump's message is about uniting all Americans under one flag. The Clinton message is that some Americans are good people and the other 40% are some form of deplorables, deserving of shame, vandalism, punishing taxation, and violence. She has literally turned Americans on each other. It is hard for me to imagine a worse thing for a presidential candidate to do.I'll say that again.As far as I can tell, the worst thing a presidential candidate can do is turn Americans against each other. Clinton is doing that, intentionally. Intentionally. As I often say, I don't know who has the best policies. I don't know the best way to fight ISIS and I don't know how to fix healthcare or trade deals. I don't know which tax policies are best to lift the economy. I don't know the best way to handle any of that stuff. (And neither do you.) But I do have a bad reaction to bullies. And I've reached my limit.I hope you have too. Therefore... I endorse Donald Trump for President of the United States because I oppose bullying in all its forms. I don't defend Trump's personal life. Neither Trump nor Clinton are role models for our children. Let's call that a tie, at worst.The bullies are welcome to drown in their own bile while those of us who want a better world do what we've been doing for hundreds of years: Work to make it better while others complain about how we're doing it.Today I put Trump's odds of winning in a landslide back to 98%.

Over the course of the presidential campaign, Donald Trump has found himself on the wrong side of issues relating to U.S. military veterans. Trump, unlike even other Republicans, has insulted veterans and used them as props to boost his campaign. 
With less than a week to go until the presidential election, Trump is back to his old dirty tricks with veterans. With Medal of Honor recipients seated behind him, Donald Trump tells supporters: ""I'm brave ¡ª financially brave."" https://t.co/uWUUhCtQso pic.twitter.com/EDd7F0PLHT 
¡ª ABC News (@ABC) November 4, 2016 
The Republican presidential candidate was listing the Medal of Honor recipients at the rally, when he stopped and said, ¡°Oh, they¡¯re so much more brave than me. I wouldn¡¯t have done what they did.¡± 
But, that self-deprecation didn¡¯t last long. 
¡°I¡¯m brave in other ways,¡± he said at the rally in Selma, a town 45 miles southeast of Raleigh. ¡°I¡¯m brave ¡ª I¡¯m financially brave. Big deal, right? These are real brave.¡± 
Medal of Honor honorees are given their medals for demonstrating extraordinary valor in combat, under fire. By comparison Trump has always led a life of privilege, including the way he avoided being drafted to serve in Vietnam, by citing mysterious ¡°bone spurs¡± that disqualified him from going into the armed forces. Coincidentally, those debilitating ¡°bone spurs¡± never showed up on Trump¡¯s official medical records. 
Other instances of Trump insulting the military include his attack on Khizr Khan, the father of a U.S. Army captain who was killed in Iraq. Trump claimed that he had suffered ¡°sacrifices¡± like the Khans as well, while building luxury apartments and hosting a reality TV show. 
Trump insulted Senator John McCain, who spent years in a Vietnamese POW camp. When he disagreed with McCain, Trump said he liked soldiers ¡°who don¡¯t get captured,¡± spitting in the face of the hundreds of prisoners of war. 
The nominee also used veterans as human shields while he was feuding with Fox News. Trump claimed he was holding a fundraiser for veterans when he decided to boycott a primary debate co-moderated by Megyn Kelly. But it turned out he never bothered to donate the money he had promised veterans until he was publicly shamed on being a cheapskate by the Washington Post .

According to two law enforcement sources, there is a group of investigators within the FBI¡¯s New York Field Office ¨C the office that discovered the recent Anthony Weiner emails ¨C that are hostile toward Clinton ¨C and it is believed that this faction is behind the recent media leaks about the ongoing Clinton Foundation investigation.

It is a clear violation of the law by these FBI agents in an attempt to influence a presidential election. If any Democrats were thinking about staying home on election day, this should really inspire them to do the opposite.

Republican Donald Trump has never been good at controlling his anger, and the same goes for his insane jealousy. 
Last night, Jay Z and Beyonce shared the stage with Hillary Clinton at a concert in Cleveland, Ohio. The A-list couple showed Clinton a stunning amount of support, followed by a powerful speech by the Democratic candidate herself. It was a monumental moment, and Trump hated every second of it. 
At a rally of his own, Trump couldn¡¯t hide the fact that he was green with envy. Trump said: 
¡°We¡¯re going to do it, folks. We¡¯re going to do it. Oh boy, are we going to win Pennsylvania big. Look at this. I hear we set a new record for this building. And by the way, I didn¡¯t have to bring J Lo or Jay Z, the only way she gets anybody. I¡¯m here all by myself. I am here all by myself. Just me. No guitar, no piano, no nothing.¡± 
Trump didn¡¯t even try to hide how sorry he felt for himself, and it was obvious that he was trying really hard not to completely lose it over the fact that no one likes him and almost no celebrities want to be affiliated with him. You can watch Trump give his pathetic, desperate speech below: 
Trump¡¯s bullsh*t campaign is finally coming to an end. He spent the beginning of his campaign promising America that he¡¯d run a star-studded campaign, and he has almost nothing to show for it almost a year later. Not even his own Republican colleagues wanted to appear with him on the campaign trail, forcing Trump to go it alone. 
Of course Trump is jealous and bitter. While Clinton doesn¡¯t need the support of the massive amount of celebrities who have endorsed her, their support is a clear sign that she is doing something right and her campaign is something worth standing by. You can watch Beyonce and Jay Z stand with Clinton below:

Republicans in Congress and perhaps across the nation are suffering today from a case of buyers remorse after Trump begins back peddling on several of his campaign promises, before he even takes office. 
Over the last few days, he backed off on his claim that he¡¯ll repeal Obamacare by saying he¡¯d just tweak it. He¡¯s seemed to have changed his mind on prosecuting Hillary Clinton and he¡¯s no longer talking about banning Muslims. While ¡°drain the swamp,¡± which referred to Washington¡¯s culture of corruption, was one of his later campaign slogans, he¡¯s filling his cabinet posts with Washington insiders and corporate lobbyists. He¡¯s even appearing to change his mind about his signature issue, the wall between the United States and Mexico . 
One piece of Trump¡¯s campaign rhetoric was actually something that would make people¡¯s lives better and it¡¯s something that Republicans are going to hate. His proposal for student loans is radical, in that it¡¯s not a gift to Wall Street and it¡¯s even more liberal than anything President Obama has proposed. In a rally just a month ago, Trump said about student loans: 
¡°We would cap repayment for an affordable portion of the borrower¡¯s income, 12.5 percent, we¡¯d cap it. That gives you a lot to play with and a lot to do,¡± Trump said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday. ¡°And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we¡¯ll let them get on with their lives. They just go ahead and they get on with their lives.¡± 
¡°Students should not be asked to pay more on the debt than they can afford,¡± Trump said. ¡°And the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.¡± 
Source: Washington Post 
Trump¡¯s proposed debt forgiveness program is actually pretty similar to Obama¡¯s . Instead of a 12.5 percent cap, Obama introduced a cap of 10 percent of a graduate¡¯s income. Trump¡¯s program, though, would leave graduates with five fewer years of debt. Trump¡¯s would forgive debt after 15 years while Obama¡¯s would forgive after 10. In that one significant way, Trump¡¯s program is even more liberal than Obama¡¯s and if he carries it out, Congressional Republicans may have no choice but to turn on their party¡¯s President. 
The American Enterprise Institute is a Washington think tank who issues a lot of the marching orders of Republicans. They were the driving force behind the Iraq war and of failed trickle down economics. This is what they have to say about student loan debt forgiveness: 
¡°They are way off on their numbers,¡± said Jason Delisle, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. ¡°If you were going to give loan forgiveness in 15 years, you¡¯re going to forgive a lot more debt than you¡¯re going to make up for in the form of the higher payments they¡¯re proposing, by a lot. I don¡¯t even need to run the numbers. It¡¯s so obvious.¡± 
Really, it¡¯s not obvious. Forgiving student debt would be a big boost to the economy because it would 1.) incentivize people to become more educated and 2.) put more money back into the economy because graduates would be free to buy more. Not that Republicans care about that, though. They prefer that graduates owe their lives to Wall Street banks and in turning his back on that, Trump is violating literally everything his party stands for.",english,2016-11-14T01:10:12.306+02:00,newcenturytimes.com,GB,,Trumpa?s Proposed Student Loan Program Makes Him Look More Liberal Than Obama; Republicans Fuming,0,http://newcenturytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-621962866.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Many of us, for some time now, have been calling out the white nationalism brewing in the nation, most specifically from the Donald Trump campaign for president and many, many of his supporters. Well, now Trump has brought that white supremacy directly into the White House with who he has named as his Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor. 
Trump just named Breitbart Executive Chairman Steve Bannon to the role of Chief Strategist and that should horrify all of us. President-elect Trump to name Stephen Bannon of Breitbart his Chief Strategist & Senior Counselor

According to Think Progress : 
¡°Trump also named Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, as ¡°chief strategist and senior counselor¡± to the president. He will be one of Trump¡¯s closest advisers and, one can presume, one of the most powerful people in America.¡± 
Bannon previously served as the Trump campaign CEO, and apparently, Trump believes he should carry that role into the White House. 
While at Breitbart, Bannon gave white supremacy and the alt-right a voice, embracing it with open arms. According to the Daily Wire : 
¡° Andrew Breitbart despised racism. Truly despised it. He used to brag regularly about helping to integrate his fraternity at Tulane University. He insisted that racial stories be treated with special care to avoid even the whiff of racism. With Bannon embracing Trump, all that changed. Now Breitbart has become the alt-right go-to website, with Yiannopoulos pushing white ethno-nationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness, and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers.¡± 
Think Progress reported: 
¡°Bannon gave a platform to Milo Yiannopoulos, a prominent white nationalist figure who was banned from Twitter for indicting racist abuse and harassment .¡± 
So now, a man who openly gave white supremacists an open platform to spread vicious hate has now been given one of the most powerful roles in the Trump administration, and in turn, the world. 
You can best be sure the alt-right white supremacists are rejoicing at this choice that gives calling it the White House a whole new meaning. 
We should all be disgusted and terrified. This is absolutely shameful, yet not at all surprising. The fact that this all comes after our first black president is all the more mortifying.

One of the biggest reasons Donald Trump was able to win enough votes to take over the White House was his relentless attacks of corruption against Hillary Clinton, all while the media virtually ignored the accusations of corruption against Donald Trump. In fact, it¡¯s looking more and more likely that by his very first day in office, Donald Trump will be the most corrupt president ever. 
MSNBC¡¯s Chris Matthews and MSNBC¡¯s Chief Legal Analyst, Ari Melber are among several who are beginning to wake up to the reality that Trump plans on using the presidency in the very worst way possible, in a way that would have the Founding Fathers rolling in their graves. Our first self-described billionaire President Elect plans on using the presidency to make himself and his family even more wealthy. 
One of the biggest problems, as Matthew sees it, is that Trump wants to give his children national security clearance and everything that goes along with it, all while letting them take the reigns of the Trump fortune. This is illegal in so many ways. 
As Melber points out, hiring family was banned in an anti-nepotism law passed in 1967. Proponents of the law were especially concerned because a President should be free to fire staff and cabinet members, but that can be tough to do if staff or cabinet members are family. Trump¡¯s workaround for the nepotism law, though, is to not give his family members official titles, but still, he hopes to include them in his decision making processes and let them sit in on critical meetings. 
Here¡¯s the thought and anger provoking video: 
While Matthews¡¯ and Melber¡¯s discussion was mostly theoretical, there are already real-life consequences to Trump¡¯s glaring conflicts of interests. 
The Washington Post on Friday reported that about 100 foreign diplomats are trying to curry favor with the Trump administration by booking rooms in Trump¡¯s Washington DC hotel, sometimes at rates of up to $20,000 a night. If you recall, the Clinton Foundation was accused of offering access in exchange for donations. The evidence that that ever happened was weak, but still, it was something that Trump didn¡¯t let go of during his entire campaign. The idea that Trump would be hosting diplomats, in his hotel, to profit his company, is way beyond anything Clinton is accused of. 
That¡¯s not even the tip of the iceberg. While he did settle the Trump University fraud case, Trump apparently Underreported: 
Trump owes millions to Deutsche Bank

¡± target=¡±_blank¡±>owes millions to Deutsche Bank, a bank which is being fined by the Department of Justice. Will Trump drop the fines in exchange for Deutsche Bank dropping their claim? Perhaps Trump will uncharacteristically take the high road (doubtful), but no president should have that power to begin with. 
I¡¯m sure as we turn over even more rocks, we¡¯ll find far more conflicts of interest and evidence that Trump only ran for office for personal enrichment. 
There¡¯s a reason elected officials are supposed to put all their assets into blind trusts (and handing them over to their kids is the exact opposite of a blind trust). Governments are not in the business of making money. Trump is. That¡¯s a conflict of interest and it should be deemed unacceptable by all Americans.

In something that could¡¯ve been scripted by George Orwell, President-elect Donald Trump just has pretty much every major media personality and/or outlet over to Trump Tower for a closed-door meeting. 
The NY Post stated : 
¡°The hour-long session included top execs from network and cable news channels. Among the attendees were NBC¡¯s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd, ABC¡¯s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz, 
Also, CBS¡¯ Norah O¡¯Donnell John Dickerson, Charlie Rose, Christopher Isham and King, Fox News¡¯ Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott, MSNBC¡¯s Phil Griffin and CNN¡¯s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett.¡± 
Before the meeting, everyone was speculating as to what was going on. Why is Trump colluding with the media? Is he trying to control the conversation and form some sort of state sponsored media? 
Well, speculate no further. Trump called everyone to his tower to scold them like the Henry the 8th he is very much turning out to be. 
According to one source who confided in the NY Post : 
¡°It was like a f¨Cing firing squad¡­Trump started with [CNN chief] Jeff Zucker and said ¡®I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed.¡± 
Adding: 
¡°The meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down.¡± 
It was basically Trump throwing a hissy fit and talking down to everyone in the media to tell them how very awful they are to him. Even though they were pretty soft on him throughout the course of his campaign, often given him an open forum and hours of free airtime to tout his craziness. 
Another source said: 
¡°The meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks.¡± 
Further: 
¡°Trump kept saying, ¡®We¡¯re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong.¡¯ He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was [a] network of liars¡­Trump didn¡¯t say [NBC reporter] Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate ¨C which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room.¡± 
Some of the media did try to get a word in edgewise, but it was pretty much all for naught. Trump was there to scold and not get a lesson from the media in freedom of the press and speech. 
NY Post reported a source saying: 
¡°[CBS Good Morning co-host Gayle] King did not stand up, but asked some question, ¡®How do you propose we the media work with you?¡¯ Chuck Todd asked some pretty pointed questions. David Muir asked ¡®How are you going to cope living in DC while your family is in NYC? It was a horrible meeting.¡± 
According to Kellyanne Conway, however, it all went really well. Yet, it¡¯s hard to believe a word that comes out of the Trump camp, because they will say only what they want people to hear, and most of the time there¡¯s barely a sliver of the truth involved. 
No word as to who the source is that spoke to the NY Post . 
It¡¯s pretty clear Trump wants to control the narrative of the press, why else would he have so many big news names over to his palace tower? He wanted to scold them and likely tell them how they should be operating, and we should all be very, very mortified that he even had them over in the first place. 
After all, if you control the press, you control what the people hear. If you control what the people hear, you can tell them anything you want, even if it¡¯s not in their best interests. It¡¯s horrifying, to say the least, absolutely Hitler-esque, if we¡¯re going to be honest. 
The press need to be counted on to hold Trump accountable for everything that he says or does, and if they don¡¯t someone needs to hold the press accountable as well. This is a scary time we¡¯re entering into and hopefully the Constitution will not be shredded and honesty with accountability will prevail.

If there¡¯s one thing we ask of a president, it¡¯s that they be inclusive of all, and President-elect Trump, in a very bizarre way, kinda sorta, did that three years ago in the most Trumpian way ever. 
While most people have Thanksgiving messages of hope and gratitude, Donald Trump wants everyone to know that he wants their day to be happy. Absolutely everyone. Even the ¡°haters and losers.¡± 
Here¡¯s Trump¡¯s Thanksgiving Day message he tweeted out three years ago: 
¡°Happy Thanksgiving to all¨Ceven the haters and losers!¡± via Twitter 
Yes, that¡¯s the future leader of the free world, everyone. A man who will have more power than, well, anyone. 
Trump took to Twitter on Thanksgiving Day in 2013 and wished everyone a ¡°Happy Thanksgiving¡± even to the ¡°haters and losers¡± and best yet, the tweet is still in his timeline . So, the future President of the United States seems pretty damn proud of calling those who don¡¯t like him ¡°haters and losers¡± because he still has it on the record in his Twitter feed. 
It will be interesting to see what he tweets this year. Will it be off the cuff, or well-vetted by his staff. I¡¯m sure we¡¯re all on pins and needles waiting. Or not.

Addressing a packed crowd of cowering press, Mr. Trump said: ¡®To thank Mr Farage for being a really great guy and good people, very good people, I have decided to give him the state of Idaho, for his own use and which he can pass on to whoever he wishes should he not be like me and immortal¡¯. 
¡®He can do whatever he fancies to it. My advice would be to turn it into a golf course. And if you see any Canadians on it, shoot them. Only kidding there folks. Canadians never bother to go to Idaho, it¡¯s too nondescript even for them. Anyway, Neil, go ahead. The state is all yours. You can twirl it around by the fuzzy bits for all I care.

And I don¡¯t care what all you carpet munching communists of the press say, Mr Putin¡¯s great people, believe me.¡¯ 
Mr Farage, 37, clearly delighted, said: ¡®I am clearly delighted. This is the greatest day of my life apart from the one where we left Europe, the one where I asked the head of the European Commission, ¡®Who are ya, who are ya?¡¯, and when I won eight per cent of the vote in Bromley & Chislehurst, pushing Labour into fourth place.

White House staff have been briefed to expect the President Elect, but Republican officials are yet to confirm if he will be arriving as Donald or his trans-identity ¨C Juanita. So muddled has the process of transition been, that Mr. Trump has lost track of his election promises, his gender and his ¨C already slim ¨C grasp on reality. 
While transitions of any kind can be traumatic, the emergence of an orange Juanita may be one change too many for an electorate unready for a female President. A Trump spokeswoman remarked: ¡®Voters are not binary. Choosing between competent candidates ¨C they want a third bat-shit-crazy option, such as Donald ¨C I mean Juanita. And if he/she/it wants to offer a third or even fourth gender, then so be it¡¯. 
Of course this is not the first time a new President has tried to redefine themselves; who can forget George W. as Forest Gump Clinton as Pepe Le Pew or Obama as the Kenyan founder of ISIS. Trump offered a reassurance that he would be President for all, a First Lady for some and a Border Guard for about three million Latinos Share this story...

Stabbing a copy of The Art Of The Deal with a Basilisk¡¯s tooth is the next step to eliminating Donald Trump, according to experts this morning. 
Donald Trump howled in agony and demanded a flask of serpent¡¯s milk to help him recover some strength after the destruction of his first Horcrux on Hollywood¡¯s Walk of Fame yesterday. 
Trump, whose unusually-styled hair is believed to hide a face on the back of his head, is understood to have concealed fragments of his soul in multiple receptacles in an attempt to protect himself from defeat in the forthcoming election. 
Fragments are believed to be hidden in places as diverse as the fabric of Trump Tower, a pussy he grabbed without warning in 2003, and Mike Pence¡¯s unnaturally shining white head of hair. 
The last Horcrux is believed to be the one national poll which has shown him in the lead. If destroyed, this would cause his organisation to fail and his acolytes, known as the Debt Eaters for their habit of bankruptcy, to disband. 
¡°The Orange Lord is not concerned by this petty attack,¡± said a spokesman for the Trump campaign. 
¡°Only a cowardly child would act like this, and Donald challenges his attacker to meet him in debate where he shall win, and win, and win again.¡± 
To show he meant business, Trump took off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves to threaten anyone who would wish him harm. 
However when Trump handed his jacket to his spokesman to hold, the spokesman cried ¡®Dobby¡¯s Free!¡¯, and vanished. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!

Americans are today being given a once in a lifetime opportunity to tell Donald Trump to go fuck himself. 
According to experts, today¡¯s vote is less an opportunity to select the leader of the free world, so much as the chance to remind Donald Trump what an arsehole they all think he is. 
Democratic countries around the globe are today united in telling Americans they have a unique chance to show the world that they have the ability to guide a leading nation in the direction of societal harmony, equality for all, and telling racists to go fuck themselves. 
US political expert, Chuck Williams, told us, ¡°Setting the persuasive policy arguments made by the candidates to one side, the United States will wake on Wednesday morning to either of two plausible realities. 
¡°One in which the downcast misogynist billionaire leader has been roundly told to fuck the fuck off, or another in which he enjoys a prolonged, ill-tempered orgasm on the Fox News network.¡± 
Williams urged Americans to imagine a forward-looking country in which Donald Trump isn¡¯t constantly forced to appear on the news in order to defend himself against accusation after inevitable accusation of improper behaviour, both privately and professionally. 
He concluded, ¡°You can either offer a number of quiet ¡®fuck you¡¯s at him many, many times over the next four years, or you can give him one enormous one today.

President-elect Donald Trump has already got a much younger, sexier county lined up to replace America in his affections. 
Concerns have already been raised after Trump demanded America enter into a pre-nup before he takes the oath of office. 
Trump, who has already been accused of screwing Mexico when he thinks he can get away with it, defended his roving eye by saying that ¡®any President¡¯ would check out hot, available countries and there was nothing wrong with it. 
Trump¡¯s penchant for ¡®exotic¡¯ foreign names is well recorded, and the people of Brunei Darussalam are already concerned after he commented on ¡®getting his tongue around their name¡¯. 
Meanwhile, members of NATO and the UN have been told to ¡®put out or get out¡¯ in what is being interpreted as a direct demand for favours. 
¡°Look, if Puerto Rico weren¡¯t a protectorate, I¡¯d already be all over them. If I weren¡¯t already their president and, you know, Is that terrible? Is it?¡±, he told reporters.

With tradition dictating that the British monarch should be amongst the first to meet a newly elected president, the Queen has assured everyone she knows exactly how to deal with men like that. 
An unnamed source close to the royal family told reporters ¡°She¡¯s basically been living with a Trump-like character for decades, so she knows the level of bloke she¡¯s dealing with. 
¡°By all accounts both the Duke of Edinburgh and Donald Trump have the same insatiable sexual appetite ¨C you can only imagine how Philip suggested they celebrate their 69th anniversary. Hopeless. 
¡°And then there¡¯s the racism. She will probably attempt to discuss important matters such as the economy and international relations with Trump, but she just knows he¡¯ll lower the tone of the conversation with racial stereotypes and outdated misogynistic views. 
¡°You know, like the ones she hears day in, day out from her husband.¡± 
It is believed that the Queen will brace herself with a few gin and tonics before meeting Trump, in the hope that the effect of the alcohol will be to take her mind off the depressing thought that the strangely coiffed reality TV star could be the last president she knows. 
Her source also added, ¡°Some people have expressed concern about the Queen having a private meeting with a self-confessed sexual predator, but they need not have any worries.

President Elect Trump has begun naming who will serve on his cabinet, and amongst the most eye-catching is the appointment of Lord Voldemort as Chief of Staff. 
¡°We knew that President Trump would need someone who could practise magic,¡± said US political expert Simon Williams. 
¡°Building a wall, repealing Obamacare, deporting three million people. That¡¯s all on the first day. I can¡¯t see any way of getting that done without the use of some pretty powerful magic. 
¡°But appointing the evilest wizard for thousands and thousands of years? That is a bold move.¡± 
Lord Voldemort, who has been described as a ¡®raging psychopath, devoid of normal human responses to other people¡¯s suffering¡¯ will be in charge of the day-to-day operation of President Trump¡¯s White House, including controlling access to the President, management of staff, and organising Secret Santa for the Christmas party. 
It is understood that Lord Voldemort had been seeking a return to public life after his humiliating defeat at the hands of Harry Potter, and came close to replacing Randy Jackson on Season 13 of American Idol, but turned it down for a promised role in Celebrity Masterchef that fell through. 
Rumours that Lord Voldemort was only offered the role after Sauron, Dark Lord of Mordor, turned it down to work with David Davis on Brexit, are so far unconfirmed.

Some priced plans aggressively, angling for market share and betting special programs built into the law would protect them from losses. Those protections didn¡¯t work as expected. Enrollees¡¯ health-care expenses repeatedly overshot the projections of nearly all Arizona¡¯s insurers. The result: a flood of red ink, then withdrawals and premium increases.   When Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces launched in fall 2013, Arizona seemed like a success. Eight insurers competed to sign up consumers, offering a wide variety of plans and some of the lowest premiums in the country. 
Today, with ACA enrollment starting Nov. 1 , Arizonans will find in most counties only one insurer selling exchange plans for 2017. Premiums for some plans will be more than double this year, some of the biggest increases in the nation. Only last-minute maneuvering prevented one Arizona county from becoming the first in the nation to have no exchange insurers at all. 
A similar dynamic is playing out in other states¡¯ exchanges, which are a critical centerpiece of the 2010 health law. About one-third of U.S. counties will have just one exchange insurer next year , up from 7% this year, estimates the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health-care issues. In many cases, remaining insurers are seeking significant rate increases. Obama on Showing ACA Works: ¡®We¡¯re Not Going To Get That Much Help Through the Media¡¯ 
A look at what happened in Arizona shows the cascading effects of problems with the design and implementation of the ACA, combined with early missteps by insurers. Some priced plans aggressively, angling for market share and betting special programs built into the law would protect them from losses. Those protections didn¡¯t work as expected. Enrollees¡¯ health-care expenses repeatedly overshot the projections of nearly all Arizona¡¯s insurers. The result: a flood of red ink, then withdrawals and premium increases. 
¡°The Arizona market is the poster child for the problems the exchanges are experiencing nationally,¡± says Tom Snook, a Phoenix-based actuary for consultants Milliman Inc. 
Opponents of the health law have cited the problems in Arizona and other states to argue for unraveling the legislation, and they have proposed changes such as expanding health-savings accounts and allowing insurers to sell plans across state lines. Trump: My employees are having problems with Obamacare 
Obama administration officials say they are bolstering the exchanges, and the consumer impact of premium increases will be limited by the law¡¯s subsidies for lower-income people, received by about 85% of enrollees nationally. ¡°We¡¯re making really good progress in addressing a lot of the issues,¡± says Kevin Counihan, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services unit charged with implementing the health law. He calls Arizona an ¡°outlier,¡± saying that insurers elsewhere have succeeded with ACA plans. 
The ACA transformed the individual insurance market, where consumers buy their own plans. Before the law, insurers could refuse to sell to people with pre-existing health conditions. Starting in 2014, consumers couldn¡¯t be denied coverage, or charged more, if they were ill. Individuals could shop for plans via an online marketplace. Partly to ensure that healthy people signed up to balance out the sick, the law contained penalties for most people if they didn¡¯t obtain coverage. Arizona expanded Medicaid, as the law envisioned. 
Insurers saw uncertainty in the new marketplace, but also potential. They had to guess what prices they needed to charge to cover the health costs of new enrollees. A 2013 Society of Actuaries report suggested that the Arizona individual-insurance market could more than double, growing to 570,681 consumers, with more than 80% of them buying through the exchange. The health-care costs of the newer customer base would be around 22% higher than the old one, it suggested. President dodges blame for Obamacare premium increases 
Insurers believed they had protective guardrails ¡ªprograms in the law to limit losses for companies that drew a lot of unhealthy, high-cost consumers. One insurer, Health Net Inc., told investors in November 2013 it could effectively pay out $1.20 in claims for each $1 it got in premiums and still break even with help from an ACA program called ¡°risk corridors.¡± Some of Health Net¡¯s Arizona products were among the lowest-priced in the country, according to Kaiser. 
Kim Walton, 62 years old, of Tempe, says his monthly insurance bill dropped by more than two-thirds compared with his pre-ACA plan, with help from a federal subsidy. Unlike his old plan, his new ACA insurance covered any costs tied to his pre-existing health conditions¡ªhe earlier had a hip replacement and suffered a broken neck. ¡°It was perfect,¡± says Mr. Walton, who owns his own business. 
Krysti Horwitz of Phoenix steered clear of the exchange. Ms. Horwitz, 35, and her husband, who own an online-marketing business, were healthy. In 2013, they had a plan that she said cost them significantly less than a new ACA one would. They weren¡¯t eligible for subsidies. They decided to keep what they had, an option the Obama administration authorized in late 2013. 
By spring of 2014, with the first year of the new ACA plans barely under way, insurers had to guess again at pricing. Rate requests for 2015 plans were due, though insurers still had scant information about who signed up. That was partly because federal officials extended the deadline for enrollment after technical problems with HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange being used in Arizona and many other states. 
One thing was already clear: Health Net¡¯s low-price gambit had won huge market share. The company ended up with nearly 92,000 enrolled in individual plans in 2014, more than seven times its 2013 total, according to insurance-data firm Mark Farrah Associates¡¯ Health Coverage Portal. 
That posed a challenge for rivals, including startup Meritus, one of the nonprofit cooperative plans launched under the ACA. Meritus drew only a few thousand consumers in 2014, and it needed to boost enrollment to sustain itself, according to Tom Zumtobel,the co-op¡¯s former CEO, who took over in late 2014. 
Meritus worked to reduce its prices, and its rates came in below competitors¡¯ in 2015. 
Once again that year, Arizona had some of the lowest exchange premiums in the U.S., and one of the most competitive marketplaces, with 11 insurers, according to the Kaiser data. Enrollment grew, particularly at Meritus, where it surged to about 48,000 in 2015, according to Mark Farrah Associates. 
On Oct. 1, 2015, insurers got a huge blow: Federal regulators announced the risk-corridor program, which many companies expected to limit their financial risk, would pay out only 12.6% of the amount expected . The program hadn¡¯t taken in enough money from successful insurers to cover the requests of those with significant losses. 
For Meritus, it was ¡°operationally devastating,¡± says Mr. Zumtobel. That Oct. 30, just two days before consumers were set to start buying their 2016 exchange plans, Arizona¡¯s regulator put the co-op under supervision, barring it from selling new insurance policies. 
Remaining insurers began retrenching. The 2016 plans included more-limited networks of health-care providers. The total number of exchange insurers ticked down to eight, from 11, and premiums rose. ¡°We started to see the cracks,¡± says Jerry Anderson, an insurance agent in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
Nearly all the Arizona individual business of exchange insurers plunged into the red, according to Mark Farrah Associates, the insurance-data firm. Health Net booked nearly $40 million in losses on its Arizona individual business in 2014, and another $39 million the following year, according to Mark Farrah Associates, when the insurer agreed to be acquired by Centene Corp. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, the biggest player in the state¡¯s individual market, had priced less aggressively than Health Net but still saw steep losses. 
Based on regulatory filings, McKinsey & Co. estimated the insurance industry suffered cumulative losses of between 9% and 11% of premium revenue on individual plans last year. Only about one-quarter of insurers reported a profit on the business. 
In Arizona, insurers set their rates too low to cover their enrollees¡¯ health expenses. There were fewer people than actuaries once projected, with about 203,000 choosing exchange plans during the enrollment period for this year. The share of enrollees who were healthy was smaller than companies projected, partly because the law¡¯s penalties weren¡¯t enough to prod them to enroll, insurers say. The unhealthy people who did sign up were more costly. Insurers say that some consumers appeared to be buying plans specifically when they had health needs. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona¡¯s ACA plans in 2014 were priced around 35% higher on average than its individual plans in 2013. ¡°In hindsight, it wasn¡¯t even close to enough,¡± says Jeff Stelnik, a senior vice president at the nonprofit. ACA-plan enrollees had medical costs around 250% higher on average than individual members before the health law, due partly to far higher prevalence of conditions such as diabetes, he says. 
Insurers began to bail out. On April 19, UnitedHealth Group Inc. said it would pull out of nearly all state ACA exchanges , including Arizona¡¯s, for the next year amid growing losses. Others in Arizona retreated, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona and Health Net, which decided to pull out of the state¡¯s most populous county, Maricopa, as well as adjacent Pinal, for 2017. On Aug. 15, Aetna Inc. announced it would leave most of its exchanges , including Arizona¡¯s. Aetna¡¯s decision created a crisis: Pinal County would have no exchange insurers for 2017. The void would short-circuit a central mechanism of the law, because consumers can get subsidies only through an ACA marketplace. 
The situation drew attention from Republicans critical of the ACA, including Arizona Sen. John McCain . He introduced a bill meant to ¡°protect AZ from Obamacare collapse,¡± according to a press release. Obama administration officials said they believed the situation would be resolved. 
In September, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona announced it would continue to sell exchange plans in Pinal next year after all. The decision came after state and federal regulators ¡°expressed their concern for Pinal residents,¡± though the insurer made the call on its own, says Blue Cross¡¯s Mr. Stelnik. 
Neighboring Maricopa County, the state¡¯s most populous, also ended up with just one insurer¡ªCentene, Health Net¡¯s new parent, which announced Sept. 14 it would sell exchange plans there next year. Centene CEO Michael F. Neidorff says his company has a very different approach from Health Net, which he says ¡°thought they would get the revenue, the growth,¡± and relied on ACA risk programs for protection. Centene said it expects to be profitable in Arizona, as it has been in other exchanges. 
That left only one county in Arizona, Pima, with more than one exchange insurer¡ªit has two. There will be a few more options sold outside the exchange, to people who don¡¯t get federal subsidies. 
Premium increases are steep, though the effect will be blunted for those who get subsidies. Blue Cross¡¯s rates are up by an average of 51% from this year, Centene¡¯s Health Net unit¡¯s, by nearly 75%. 
Mr. Walton, the consumer who benefited from lower premiums at the start of the exchange, worries he won¡¯t be able to find a plan that includes his primary-care physician and his cardiologist. ¡°I don¡¯t know what¡¯s going to happen come November,¡± he says.

Billionaire Sheldon Adelson just committed $25 million to an anti-Hillary Clinton Super PAC to try and help tilt the presidential race and down ballot House and Senate races to Republicans, Fox News learned Monday. There are indications the casino magnate will pony up even more by the end of the week. 
Two senior Republican sources familiar with the donation described it to Fox News as a ¡°massive¡± amount of money to be spent during the final week of the presidential race and a sign that Adelson, who has largely been on the sidelines after initially suggesting he would give $100 million to help Donald Trump, is now going all in on the Republican nominee. GOP donors pouring-last minute money into the race: 
The money will benefit Future 45 , a Super PAC launched by the Ricketts family in Chicago, founders of TD Ameritrade. The group has recently been running a television ad in battlegrounds comparing Clinton to Richard Nixon, calling her a ¡°secretive, paranoid politician who destroyed 30,000 pieces of evidence.¡± 
The Republican sources said the contribution was made in the last few days as the FBI re-ignited its investigation of Clinton¡¯s email server, and could spark other big GOP donors ¨C who may have thought the Democratic nominee was coasting to victory just days ago ¡ª to step up their support of Trump in the final days. 
Most importantly, one source familiar with the Adelson contribution revealed he is considering pouring as much as another $25 million dollars into the race before Election Day on November 8. 
The first major contribution came as Trump visited Adelson¡¯s Venetian resort and casino in Las Vegas for a rally with supporters on Sunday. Trump praised Adelson and his wife, Miriam, without any reference to the money that went to the Super PAC. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

But this year, conspiracy theorists have claimed that the MSM was not only in the bag for Crooked Hillary, but actively working to secure her election with false polls, false stories and rampant and illegal collusion with the candidate.   Thank you, WikiLeaks , for making this a memorable year for discovering the truth behind the power that controls our system. 
Historians will look back on the Presidential Election of 2016 as the, not ¡°a¡±, but the turning point in American history for a variety of reasons. Not the least of which will be that, because Donald Trump ran and was attacked by such an army of haters, that the truth about so many things previously kept hidden was brought out into the open. So today we are happy to bring you: The Top 5 Conspiracy Theories Proven To Be True In 2016 THE BUSH FAMILY ARE PART OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER: Every since George H.W. Bush uttered his ¡° we will bring in a New World Order ¡± speech in 1991, conspiracy theorists has speculated that the Bush Crime Family were not really Republicans or even Conservatives, but globalists with a secret agenda. It took the nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican candidate for president to bring these worms out from under their rock. Not only have they opposed Trump, and refused to support the nominee of the party they claim to belong to, they are actively working to try and elect Crooked Hillary , globalist candidate for president. PROVEN TRUE. THE LIBERAL MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS CORRUPT: Every election year, charges of favoritism in the media fly back and forth, this is as old as the Republic itself. But this year, conspiracy theorists have claimed that the MSM was not only in the bag for Crooked Hillary , but actively working to secure her election with false polls , false stories and rampant and illegal collusion with the candidate . WikiLeaks, one of the best friends the truth has in America, exposed all that and more this election 2016. It showed that not only were the conspiracy theorists right, they didn¡¯t go far enough in their speculations. PROVEN TRUE. THE DNC RIGGED THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION PROCESS: After candidate Bernie Sanders exhibited Trump-sized crowds everywhere he went, people were shocked when he was so easily beaten by Crooked Hillary who struggles to draw people to her rallies. As it turned out, the DNC was not only actively working to nominate Hillary , they were also actively working to suppress the momentum of Bernie Sanders. PROVEN TRUE. THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SOLD ACCESS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT: For years now, conspiracy buffs have made the claim that the Clinton Crime Family, and Crooked Hillary sold access to the State Department for cash and favors. A book called Clinton Cash was even published documenting all this. But when WikiLeaks released emails proving this to be true and exposing the connections, it ceased to be a theory albeit remaining a conspiracy. PROVEN TRUE. GEORGE SOROS IS THE POWER BEHIND NEARLY ALL OF IT: George Soros real life history reads like a sordid crime novel. Born Jewish, he switched teams as a teenager in WWII and sided with the Nazis . This began a life of crime and intrigue that helped him amass an enormous fortune. Revelations in 2016 have showed Soros to be one of Hillary Clinton¡¯s largest single donors , his orders were carried out by Crooked Hillary¡¯s State Department, he funded the race riots which started in 2015, and he is behind massive voter fraud both here and around the world. If you go to vote and see a SmartMatic voting machine , immediately demand a paper ballot if you want your vote to be accurately recorded. George Soros is even the financial power behind the massive wave of Muslim migration in Europe. And the money behind Black Lives Matters as well. PROVEN TRUE. 
So thank you, WikiLeaks , for making this a memorable year for discovering the truth behind the power that controls our system. And thank you, Donald J. Trump, for having the courage to run this campaign, spending $100 million of your own money, and calling us to make America great, again. CNN Caught Covering Up Hillary Cheating at Debates: Gen.

In 70 AD, Israel was destroyed by the Romans and the Temple stones toppled to the ground exactly as Jesus said it would happen. When you subtract 70 AD from 2018 AD, where does that leave you? It leaves you square in 1948 AD. Please pause here and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. by Geoffrey Grider November 3, 2016 God likes to orchestrate events relating to Israel around the number 70 
¡°In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years , whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.¡± Daniel 9:2 (KJV) 
People, you better buckle up because things are about to become unglued. For well over a year now, we here at NTEB have been telling you that Donald Trump is God¡¯s man for the White House, and that Bible prophecy would be fulfilled in the process. Two very eye-opening articles you need to read are The Real Reason Why Donald Trump Was Chosen To Be The Republican Candidate For President and Why A Bible Believer Is Supporting Donald Trump For President Of The United States . I wrote those articles on May 4 and February 13, respectively. Israel in general and Jerusalem in particular are God¡¯s time clock for the fulfillment of Bible prophecy 
On our Sunday night radio show , which you can access here , we talked about Donald Trump, Bible prophecy and the coming global shaking. And believe me when I tell you it¡¯s coming. In the 9th chapter of Daniel we see that he finally understands what Israel¡¯s Babylonian captivity is all about by reading the prophecy Jeremiah had written. That was Daniel¡¯s ¡°a-ha!¡± moment. 
¡°And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years . And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.¡± Jeremiah 25:11,12 (KJV) 
After digesting that bombshell , Daniel is then visited by the angel Gabriel who gives Daniel his own shocking prophecy of the Seventy Weeks Of Years. All of that prophecy has been fulfilled except the last week, or 7 year period, known as the time of Jacob¡¯s trouble as found in the book of Jeremiah and mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 24 as the time of ¡°great tribulation¡±. 
¡°Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob¡¯s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.¡± Jeremiah 30:7 (KJV) 
¡°For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.¡± Matthew 24:21 (KJV) 
On May 14, 2018, Israel will have been officially regathered , in fulfillment of Bible prophecy, for exactly 70 years. In 70 AD, Israel was destroyed by the Romans and the Temple stones toppled to the ground exactly as Jesus said it would happen. When you subtract 70 AD from 2018 AD, where does that leave you? It leaves you square in 1948 AD. Please pause here and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. 
Donald Trump was born on June 14, 1946. If you move ahead 70 years from that date, that brings you to June 14, 2016. Moving forward another seven months brings you to Jan. 14, 2017, and moving forward another seven days brings you to Jan. 21, 2017. This is happening in the year 5777 according to the Jewish calendar. 
And if Donald Trump wins the election , Jan. 21 will be his first full day in office. Of course Trump would be inaugurated on Jan. 20, but he would only be president for part of that day. So that means that Donald Trump would be 70 years, seven months and seven days old on his first full day as president of the United States . Please pause here as well, and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. 
All this brings us to our last point, and here it is. One of the many campaign promises that Donald Trump has made is that he will move the US Embassy in Israel from its current location in Tel Aviv, to its new location in Jerusalem in accordance with the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 . By doing that, the United States will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and thus set off the Psalm 83 War as found in the Bible. 
¡°They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:¡± Psalm 83:4,5 (KJV) 
For it is Jerusalem, what the Bible calls the ¡°apple of God¡¯s eye¡±, that the real battle will be fought over. Why do you think that the Palestinians have always rejected the so-called Two State Solution? Because that solution calls for Jerusalem and the Temple Mount to stay with Israel, and the Muslims will not stand for that. They want Jerusalem for the same reason that the Antichrist fights the Battle of Armageddon for it. Because Jerusalem is where Jesus returns to, and where He will rule from for a thousand years. Jerusalem is the reason for all the conflict, all the fighting, all the past wars, and the coming war. 
¡°Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem. And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.¡± Zechariah 12:2,3 (KJV) 
This election is going to usher in a time of amazing fulfillment of Bible prophecy. It is no coincidence of any kind that Donald Trump will be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day in office. It is not luck, fortune, happenstance or karma that he beat his 16 competitors for the nomination. As I have said for over a year now, Donald Trump is God¡¯s man for ¡°such a time as this¡±, and that we are living in the days of visible fulfillment of Bible prophecy. 
As we started our radio show on this topic on this past Sunday night, do you know what the headline story on the Jerusalem Post website was? It was this: Ivanka Trump says her father will move US embassy to Jerusalem ¡®100%¡¯ if elected 
If Donald Trump becomes President on Tuesday , as I believe with all my heart he will, then you better start thinking about the time of Jacob¡¯s trouble beginning sometime on or around May of 2018. That means the Rapture of the Church will have to happen before that. Please pause here as well, and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. 
Are YOU ready for what comes next? Because, brothers and sisters, it sure looks like it¡¯s coming.

Trump appeared at two rallies in the state Monday, and his children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka stumped around the state this week. 
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz appeared at a campaign rally with vice presidential candidate Mike Pence Thursday in Portage, Mich. on the state¡¯s west side ¡ª an area where Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich performed well in the GOP primary. 
Both candidates have made ¡° six-figure ¡± advertising purchases in the state in the last days before the election. Clinton¡¯s campaign dumped $2.5 million in Michigan in two days alone, according to tabloid news outlet TMZ . Laura Ingraham on Why Trump Can Pull Off an Election Upset Over Clinton on Tuesday: 
Clinton enjoyed as much as a 13-point advantage over Trump in Michigan just two weeks ago. The Democratic nominee has not made Michigan a regular campaign stop while Trump has focused on the state and other rust belt states as a potential path to victory. 
While Michigan hasn¡¯t voted for a Republican candidate for president since President George H. W. Bush in 1988, the state is home to vast swaths of conservative-leaning precincts and a well-established state party apparatus. Michigan¡¯s governor and both legislative chambers are controlled by Republicans and the state¡¯s congressional delegation is made up of nine Republicans and five Democrats. 
Democrats have been able to win presidential elections by ¡°running up the score¡± in its urban areas and population bases, something Clinton hoped would keep the state safely in her corner without diverting resources and time from other battleground states. 
¡°Trump is over performing in key segments of the electorate especially in rural areas and Macomb County while Clinton is failing to get the numbers she needs out of the city of Detroit,¡± John Yob, CEO of Strategic National, who conducted the poll, reported. 
Out of the poll¡¯s respondents , 75 percent were contacted by landline, while 25 percent were contacted over cellular phone. The poll was conducted through landlines, using Interactive Voice Response and the margin of error for the poll is 4.09 percent. source

Bernie Saunders ¡ª distrust Clinton, said Wayne Bradley, state director of African-American engagement for the Michigan Republican Party. by Geoffrey Grider November 5, 2016 Donald Trump is on track to double Gov. Mitt Romney¡¯s support among African-American voters, according to a series of state polls. In 2012, African-Americans comprised a record 13 percent of all voters. President Barack Obama was reelected with 93 percent of the African-American vote, leaving Gov. Mitt Romney with only 6 percent of the African-American vote. Obama is now campaigning against Trump, and hoping to keep his share of the African-American vote below the 11 percent that George W. Bush won in 2004 during the housing bubble. On Friday , a poll of 506 Pennsylvania voters by Harper Polling showed Trump has the support of 18.46 percent of African-Americans. That¡¯s eight points more than Romney¡¯s share of the national vote in 2012, and if it proves true during the ballot, that 18.46 percent African-American support translates into 2 point shift towards Trump. The poll also said another 4.6 percent were undecided. Trump acknowledges ¡®Blacks for Trump¡¯ supporters: The Harper poll is small , with an error margin of 4.4 percent, but an Oct. 30 poll of 1,249 likely voters in Pennsylvania showed Trump has 19 percent support among African Americans, while another 7 percent remain undecided. That poll has a error margin of 2.77 percent. In next-door Michigan, two nights of a tracking poll conducted for Fox 2 of 1,150 likely voters showed Trump with 14 percent support and 19 percent support, leaving Clinton with 83 percent and 79 percent support. That¡¯s equivalent to a two-point shift from Clinton to Trump in the state. ¡°We¡¯re showing Donald Trump doing far better among African-Americans than any other Republican in modern memory, said John Yob, CEO of a Michigan-based polling firm, Strategic National . Trump ¡°has done an excellent job in campaigning for the votes of African-Americans,¡± he said, partly by campaigning in Detroit, said Yob, whose automated tracking polls show Trump and Clinton running level in the state. Black Trump Supporters Explain Why They are Voting for Donald Trump: Donald Trump is gaining in Michigan partly because many African-American voters ¡ª especially younger voters who backed Sen. Bernie Saunders ¡ª distrust Clinton, said W ayne Bradley, state director of African-American engagement for the Michigan Republican Party. ¡°T here is a tremendous trust deficit with Hillary Clinton¡± because tough anti-crime laws established when her husband was president in the 1990s, he said. That distrust has helped cause a sharp drop in the number of absentee ballots mailed in from Detroit, even as other part of the state send in more ballots that before, Bradley said. Faced with a low turnout, the Clinton campaign is trying to frighten African-Americans to vote, but ¡°t hat¡¯s not a convincing enough argument,¡± he said. ¡°Detroit as of Wednesday had seen absentee ballots returns equaling just 46 percent of the total 2012 absentee vote in the city, and the city clerk¡¯s office is forecasting a decline of 10,000 absentee ballots compared to 2012, a fall of 12.5 percent,¡± according to a review of absentee records by the Gongwer.com website, which intensively tracks Michigan politics. It is ¡°possible that the falloff portends reduced [election day] voting at the precincts, in which case ¡­ Clinton could net something like 32,000 fewer votes out of the city than President Barack Obama did in 2012.¡± But other polls offer better news to Clinton. A Detroit Free Press poll of 600 likely Michigan voters released Nov. 4 showed that ¡°Among black voters, her margin also grew substantially, to 92% compared to 88% two weeks ago.¡± National Trends Trump¡¯s gain among African-American voters is happening in many states, alongside an overall reduction in African-American enthusiasm and support for Obama¡¯s designated successor. That drop-off in support from Obama¡¯s 93 percent level will likely reduce the turnout for Clinton. MSNBC reporter wasn¡¯t expecting Black Americans to vote for Trump: That¡¯s a problem for Democrats, because a 7.5 percent drop in nationwide African-American turnout would be equal to a one-point drop in a nationwide vote for Clinton. Reports say the early-voting turnout by African-Americans has dropped by up to 10 percent in North Carolina and by somewhat less in Florida . President Barack Obama and other top Democrats have hopscotched through the states to push that turnout back up by election day. But pollsters face problems when trying to gauge opinions in a high-stakes emotional competition. For example, a large slice of African-Americans are picking ¡°undecided¡± in some polls. The Washington Post is reporting that Clinton is leading Trump by 79 percentage points among African-Americans, but the fine print in the article says Clinton¡¯s score is 82 percent and Trump¡¯s score is 3 percent ¡ª leaving 15 percent who did not pick either candidate. So if Trump gets just one-in-five of the undecided African-American voters, he reaches Romney¡¯s 2012 level. Blacks for Trump, It¡¯s a Thing: Some concerned people lie to pollsters. For example, roughly 7 percent of college grads hide their support for Trump when they¡¯re ask by pollsters over the phone, perhaps out of fear of penalties if their choice was made public. So when polls show a non-answer from respondents, for example, many undecided voters, the votes may be hiding a weak or strong preference for Trump. These factor may be impacting polls of African-Americans, who are being hammered by claims from Clinton and Obama that Trump is supposedly a racist. ¡°If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers ¡ª the Klan ¡ª and hesitate when asked about that support, then you¡¯ll tolerate that support when you¡¯re in office,¡± Obama told an African-American crowd in North Carolina on Nov. 3. For example, Public Policy Polling ¡ª which mostly works for Democratic clients ¡ª used phone interviews in a poll that showed Trump with just 9 percent support in Michigan among 957 likely voters, of whom 12 percent were African-American. The poll said none of the roughly 110 African-Americans were undecided in a two-person race, even though 8 percent said they were unsure when they were asked if they had a favorable view of Trump. In contrast, the Harper Polling survey in Pennsylvania got very different answers from African-Americans. Trump got 18.5 percent support in a four-person race, although many respondents waffled when they were asked to pick between just Clinton and Trump. When asked to pick either of the two main candidates, only 12.3 percent supported Trump, while 13.9 percent declared themselves to be undecided. So Trump actually picked up half of the undecideds when the respondents were allowed to chose from the four candidates. Polls A national poll by TIPP showed Clinton at only 75 percent support among all non-whites, including Hispanics, African-Americans and Latinos. That poll showed Trump getting support from 15 percent of non-whites , leaving 5 percent undecided and 5 percent supporting other candidates. In North Carolina, 19 percent of African-Americans support Trump, according to an Oct. 30 survey of 1176 likely voters by Remington Research Group. An Oct. 28 to Oct. 31 poll in North Carolina by SurveyUSA showed Trump with 14 percent support in a poll of 800 adults, including 659 likely voters. African-Americans comprised 21 percent of the voters in the poll. SurveyUSA is the top-ranked pollster in Nate Silver¡¯s rankings . But a late October poll of African-Americans in North Carolina by Siena University showed 89 percent support for Clinton and 1 percent for Trump ¡ª but it also showed 6 percent staying they did not know who they will vote for, and 11 percent support for the GOP Gov. Pat McCrory. In Florida, a Siena University poll showed that Trump had the support of 13 percent of African-Americans. More ominously for Clinton, she had the support of only 83 percent, while 4 percent said they didn¡¯t know who to vote for. If Trump gets one-quarter of the 4 percent, he reaches 14 percent of the African-American vote, leaving Clinton with roughly 86 percent. In Virginia, a survey by Public Policy Polling taken in Nov. 3 and Nov. 4 showed Trump with 9 percent support and Clinton with 91 percent support. A Remington Research automated poll of 1,106 likely voters in Virginia showed Trump with 19 percent , and Clinton with just 78 percent support. In Georgia, a Nov. 2 to Nov. 3 poll of 1,000 likely voters showed Trump with 12 percent of the African-American vote, leaving Clinton with 85 percent. Amid the disagreement, rivalries and complexity, Bradley is confident that Trump will do well among African-Americans. His final tally as the GOP candidate ¡°will be a higher number that it has been in the past¡­ [because] he¡¯s working, he¡¯s coming to these cities to deliver the message.¡± The African-American vote may even be enough to help push Trump over the so-called ¡°blue wall¡± of Democratic northern states that stands in his path to the White House. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

It was passed for the purposes of initiating and funding the relocation of the Embassy of the United States in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.   8, 2016 Jerusalem will be the portal through which God administers His Justice to a depraved world. Jerusalem will be His ¡°burdensome stone¡± with which He judges the world. 
¡°The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.¡± Proverbs 16:33 (KJV) 
As Americans who love this country, it is absolutely crystal-clear who we should vote for. Only one candidate¡¯s campaign slogan is Make America Great Again, only one candidate says that they will # DrainThe Swamp . I think you get the idea. But you can be a patriotic America and not be a Christian, right? Trump: It¡¯s Time To Drain The Swamp In Washington, D.C ¨C Five-Point Plan For Ethics Reform So is the a compelling, overarching reason why a Bible believing Christian should vote for Donald Trump? Yes, there is 
Donald Trump has made as part of his platform a promise to move the American Embassy from its current location in Tel Aviv to its new location in Jerusalem. In fact, it was signed into law in 1995, read this: 
The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 is a public law of the United States passed by the 104th Congress on October 23, 1995. It was passed for the purposes of initiating and funding the relocation of the Embassy of the United States in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , no later than May 31, 1999, and attempted to withhold 50 percent of the funds appropriated to the State Department specifically for ¡°Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad¡± as allocated in fiscal year 1999 until the United States Embassy in Jerusalem had officially opened. The act also called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city and for it to be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel. Israel¡¯s declared capital is Jerusalem, but this is not internationally recognized, pending final status talks in the Israeli¨CPalestinian conflict . The United States has withheld recognition of the city as Israel¡¯s capital. The proposed law was adopted by the Senate (93¨C5),and the House (374¨C37). 
Contained in the Jerusalem Embassy Act is a prophecy bombshell , perhaps when you skimmed through it just now you missed so let me break it out for you, ready? 
¡°¡­called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city and for it to be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel. 
Now please pause at this juncture and think about what that means for a Bible believer. Do you know why the Palestinians have, for 20 years, refused to accept the so-called Two State Solution ? Because the Two State Solution does not give Jerusalem to Palestine, it gives it to its rightful owner, Israel. The Battle of Armageddon will be fought over who will gain control of, not just Israel in general, but the rights to Jerusalem in particular! The word ¡°Jerusalem¡± appears 811 times in your King James Bible, think that God places a lot of importance on it? 
¡°Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.¡± Zechariah 12:2 (KJV) 
God says if you go against His city of Jerusalem that it will mean ¡°lights out¡± for you. Jerusalem will be the portal through which God administers His Justice to a depraved world. Jerusalem will be His ¡°burdensome stone¡± with which He judges the world. 
¡°And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.¡± Zechariah 12:3 (KJV) NTEB PRESENTS: Donald Trump, Jerusalem and Bible Prophecy 
We just launched a YouTube channel for Bible teaching and prophecy, and here is our very first video of our radio show on Donald Trump and Jerusalem. Please subscribe to our YouTube channel by clicking here , thank you! 
Bible believers, let¡¯s be honest. God is not really so much concerned with any election in any nation so much as He is with His nation of Israel and its capital city of Jerusalem. That¡¯s where God¡¯s passion is, that¡¯s where His heart is. Genesis says that if you want God¡¯s blessing, then bless His nation of Israel and bless His chosen people, the Jews. 
¡°And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.¡± Genesis 12:3 (KJV) Christian, do you need a reason from the Bible to vote for Donald Trump? 
I just gave you two, very powerful and very Biblical reasons to vote for Donald Trump. He will move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, and he will love Israel and God will bless us for that. Now, get up, put your ¡°big boy¡± and ¡°big girl¡± pants on, and go out and vote . 
Not for the ¡°lesser of two evils¡± as some erroneously assert, but for the only candidate that will fulfill Bible prophecy

EDITOR¡¯S NOTE: One of the great blessings of Trump¡¯s campaign is that he exposed all the fakers, and phonies, pretend Republicans and wealthy, global elites who have been milking this country dry while actively working against it. Now we, the American people, humbly ask you to keep your promised to leave the country if your candidate lost. She did. Now get out. You¡¯re with her, right? 
The threat is a common one after any election outcome: Canada¡¯s immigration website crashed from heavy traffic as it looked increasingly likely that Donald Trump would win. But after the real estate mogul clinched the presidency in a stunning victory early Wednesday morning, some of those stars will face questions about making good on their promise. 
Here is a list of some of the celebs who claimed they would move out of the U.S. under a Trump administration. Liberal Actors 
Bryan Cranston said he hopes he doesn¡¯t have to pack his bags, but would ¡°definitely move¡± if Trump won. ¡°Absolutely, I would definitely move,¡± the ¡°Breaking Bad¡± star said on ¡°The Bestseller Experiment¡± podcast. ¡°It¡¯s not real to me that that would happen.

Samuel L. Jackson slammed Trump for running a ¡°hate¡±-filled campaign and said he would move to South Africa if he wins. ¡°If that mother becomes president, I¡¯m moving my black ass to South Africa,¡± the movie star quipped to Jimmy Kimmel.

Neve Campbell, an actress on the political drama ¡°House of Cards,¡± vowed to move back home to Canada, while ¡°Orange is the New Black¡± actress Natasha Lyonne said she would hightail it to a mental hospital. Liberal Singers 
Cher tweeted this summer that if Trump gets elected, ¡°I¡¯m moving to Jupiter.¡± 
Miley Cyrus wrote in an emotional Instagram post in March that tears were running down her cheek and she was unbelievably scared and sad. ¡°I am moving if he is president,¡± the young pop star said. ¡°I don¡¯t say things I don¡¯t mean!¡± 
Barbara Streisand, a vocal Clinton supporter, told ¡°60 Minutes¡± that ¡°I¡¯m either coming to your country if you¡¯ll let me in, or Canada.¡± 
Ne-Yo told TMZ last month that he¡¯d move to Canada and be neighbors with fellow R&B singer Drake if the country elected Donald Trump. Liberal Comedians 
Comedian Amy Schumer said in September that Spain would be her destination of choice. 
¡°My act will change because I will need to learn to speak Spanish,¡± Schumer said in an appearance on the BBC¡¯s ¡°Newsnight.¡± ¡°Because I will move to Spain or somewhere. It¡¯s beyond my comprehension if Donald Trump won. It¡¯s just too crazy.¡± 
Chelsea Handler said she already made contingency plans months ago. 
¡°I did buy a house in another country just in case,¡± the comedian and talk show host said during an appearance on ¡°Live with Kelly and Michael¡± in May. ¡°So all these people that threaten to leave the country and then don¡¯t ¡ª I actually will leave that country.¡± Former ¡°Daily Show¡± host Jon Stewart said he would consider ¡°getting in a rocket and going to another planet, because clearly this planet¡¯s gone bonkers¡± if the real estate mogul wins. 
Whoopi Goldberg, co-host of the ¡°The View¡±, said on an episode of the talk show earlier this year that if the country elects Trump, ¡°maybe it¡¯s time for me to move, you know. I can afford to go.¡± Keegan-Michael Key said he would flee north to Canada. ¡°It¡¯s like, 10 minutes from Detroit,¡± the comedian told TMZ in January. ¡°That¡¯s where I¡¯m from; my mom lives there. It¡¯d make her happy too.¡± 
Hispanic comedian George Lopez said Trump ¡°won¡¯t have to worry about immigration¡± if he takes the White House because ¡°we¡¯ll all go back.¡± Liberal Political Figures 
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joked in an interview with The New York Times in July that it¡¯d be time to move to New Zealand if Trump were to win. 
¡°Now it¡¯s time for us to move to New Zealand,¡± she said quoting her husband who died in 2010. ¡°I can¡¯t imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president. For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be ¡ª I don¡¯t even want to contemplate that.¡±

Education Minister Naftali Bennett , who heads the hardline Jewish Home party , said Trump¡¯s victory eradicated the idea of a Palestinian state. He said the unprecedented win was an ¡®opportunity for Israel to immediately retract the notion of a Palestinian state in the centre of the country, which would hurt our security and just cause¡¯.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said Moscow is ready to contribute to rebuilding relations with the United States with Donald Trump as president. EDITOR¡¯S NOTE: Since Hillary Clinton¡¯s and Barack Obama¡¯s failed ¡°Russian Reset¡± back in 2009, international relations between Russia and the United States have been a chilly 5 or 6 degrees above freezing. For the past year and a half, Russia and America have not talked at all, with Russia assuming power in the Middle East in Syria. Just hours after Donald Trump¡¯s historic Electoral College landslide, Vladimir Putin has extended the olive branch of friendship and it could not have come at a better time. ¡°We have heard the pre-election statements by then-candidate Trump, which were directed at rebuilding relations between Russia and the US,¡± Putin said during a speech before several ambassadors in the Kremlin. ¡°We understand that this will not be an easy path considering the unfortunate degradation of relations,¡± he said. ¡°But Russia is ready and wants to restore full-fledged relations with the US.¡±¡°We are ready to do our part and do everything to return (US-Russian) relations to the trajectory of development,¡± he said. ¡°This would be in the interest of Russian and American people and would positively affect the general climate in international relations, considering the special responsibility of Russia and the US for ensuring global stability and security.¡± Remember this unqualified disaster? 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spearheaded the disastrous ¡°Russian Reset¡± back in March of 2009 which only served to further damage relations with Russia. They couldn¡¯t even spell the words on the thing properly. With reporters looking on, Clinton met Lavrov and handed him a gift ¨C a green box tied in green ribbon. He unwrapped it to reveal a ¡° reset button ¡± a lighthearted reminder of Vice President Joe Biden¡¯s recent remark that the administration of US President Barack Obama is hitting the reset button with Russia after years of friction during the Bush administration. The trouble was , the Russian-language label the Americans put on top of the button had the wrong word. Before she realised the mistake, Clinton assured Lavrov her staff had ¡°worked hard¡± to get it right. Was it right? she inquired with a smile. ¡°You got it wrong,¡± Lavrov responded, also smiling. He said the word the Americans chose ¨C¡°peregruzka¡±¨C meant ¡°overloaded¡± or ¡°overcharged¡± rather than ¡°reset¡±. Clinton quickly retorted with: ¡°well, we won¡¯t let you do that to us, I promise¡±. It was an embarrassment for the United States, to say the very least. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov wants people to stop asking him about the failed ¡°reset¡± with Russia because he says ¡°it was the invention of Hillary Clinton and Obama administration.¡± Putin earlier became one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump via a telegram for his surprise triumph over Hillary Clinton. Putin has tacitly supported Trump during the campaign, while Trump repeatedly flattered and praised the Russian leader and said he was willing to work with him. Russia¡¯s parliament on Wednesday broke into applause upon learning of Trump¡¯s win, and Russian markets climbed up, against the global slump on the news. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",english,2016-11-10T01:20:25.940+02:00,nowtheendbegins.com,,27046,RESET: Vladimir Putin Says That Russia Is Ready To Do It¡¯s Part To Rebuild Ties With America Under Trump,0,https://nteb-mudflowermedia.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/russia-rset-putin-ready-to-work-with-donald-trump-president-united-states.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

EDITOR¡¯S NOTE: As stupid as this seems on the surface, at this point, I am not taking anything for granted. Donald Trump voters across America need to be made aware of this, and even now be working against it. Remember that with the Clintons, it¡¯s never over. Ever. And as Christopher Stevens and Vince Foster will tell you, these people will stop at nothing. And please be forewarned, while this petition strategy is far-fetched, it is not impossible. The petition , launched on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected President, calls for the Electoral College to ¡°ignore their states¡¯ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.¡± Although Trump won over the 270 necessary electoral votes to secure the Presidency, Clinton narrowly earned the nation¡¯s popular vote . The Electoral College ¨C which was first introduced in 1804 ¨C is comprised of 538 electors. Each state¡¯s number of electors is decided by its number of members in Congress, which is dependent on the state¡¯s population. So, when American citizens cast their ballots, they aren¡¯t directly voting for president ¨C they¡¯re voting for electors. This year, Trump took 279, to Clinton¡¯s 228. Petition circulates for Clinton presidency: Most states use a ¡°winner-take-all¡± system when it comes to electoral votes, although there is no Constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote a certain way. Twenty-six states and Washington, D.C., do, however, ¡°bind¡± their electors to vote for the promised candidate on Dec. 19 ¨C in this case, Trump. In many cases, ¡°faithless electors¡± are forced to pay a fine if they vote against the popular choice. Understanding what a ¡°Faithless Elector¡± is: 
In order for Hillary¡¯s supporters to be successful, they will need to sway a significant number of the Electoral College to become ¡°faithless electors¡±. This video will make it clear what exactly that is and how the process works. Maine and Nebraska follow a different method , called the congressional district method, which allots two electoral votes to the popular vote winner, and additional votes for each congressional district won by the candidates. Crying Hillary Voters Compilation: Faithless electors have not ever reversed the presidency. The Change.org petition, which was at over 500,000 signatures on Thursday afternoon, said that Clinton supporters would be happy to pay any fees accrued by those who choose to be faithless electors. ¡°Mr. Trump is unfit to serve,¡± the petition claimed. ¡°His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic.

Now, in the interest of full disclosure , when the Kenyan-born and Muslim-raised Barack Hussein Obama was elected, I declared he would ¡°never be my president¡±. And for the entire time of his presidency I wrote over 1,300 articles exposing him and his Marxist plan for America. Let this website be my witness to that. This is how I exercised my Constitutional right to free speech. But at no time did I ever protest in the streets, ever threaten another human being, and I never used the global platform of NTEB to ever call for physical violence of any kind ever. 
Why not? 
Because though I despised the anti-American president Obama, I still loved America and the ideals she stood for. I saw myself as a patriot in exile, but still teared up every time I heard the National Anthem or read about a soldier¡¯s heroic sacrifice on a foreign battlefield. These anti-Trump protesters that are clogging city streets at this very moment hate America, hate what this nation stands for, and seek to destroy it and us. They preach ¡°love¡± while they shoot innocent people in the streets, they demand ¡°tolerance¡± while offering none.

¡°Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.¡± Zechariah 12:2 (KJV) 
EDITOR¡¯S NOTE: Donald Trump¡¯s campaign promise to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is t he whole reason why I supported him in the first place. From a Bible prophecy perspective the implications and ramifications of such a move are off the charts. We warned from the very start that this move could easily trigger the Psalm 83 War. And right on cue, here comes the Palestinians protesting it already. Things are about to get very, very interesting¡­to say the least. 
¡°If people attack us by moving the embassy to Jerusalem, which is a violation of Security Council resolutions, it is a violation of Resolution 181 of the UN general assembly that was drafted by the U.S. ¡­ it means they are showing belligerency towards us. ¡­ If they do that nobody should blame us for unleashing all of the weapons that we have in the UN to defend ourselves and we have a lot of weapons in the UN,¡± Riyad Mansour said . 
Mansour conceded that such a move could not be passed as a Security Council resolution because of the U.S. veto. Nevertheless, he warned Trump, ¡°Maybe I can¡¯t have resolutions in the Security Council but I can make their lives miserable everyday with precipitating a veto on my admission as a member state.¡± 
Mansour warned that he would ¡°reopen the whole Pandora¡¯s Box¡± of verdicts in the International Criminal Court of Justice on the issue of Israel¡¯s security fence and the settlements. 
He added that ¡°it is illegal to defy Security Council resolutions that the U.S. is party to that the unilateral action by Israel annexing East Jerusalem is illegal and it is null and void.

After Trump won the presidential election on Tuesday, threats against his life spread on social media, as the Daily Mail reported : 
¡°So who¡¯s going to assassinate Trump at his inauguration?¡± one Twitter user demanded to know. 
¡°I just pray that the first n***a who tries to assassinate Donald Trump don¡¯t miss,¡± another added. 
One joked: ¡°My mom is talking about assassinate donald trump. watch out guy my white suburban mother is coming for you.¡± 
While some also called for the death of vice president-elect Mike Pence. 
¡°If trump wins pls dont assassinate him without getting mike pence first because his a** is ****ing crazy,¡± one user tweeted¡­ 
A source close to the Secret Service, told the DailyMail.com that the agency were well aware of the threats and that they had seen a spike since Trump was elected on Tuesday. 
They said there were ¡®mechanisms in place¡¯ to monitor social media for such posts, and to determine which threats were more concerning than others but said that ¡°every threat was taken seriously.¡± 
Twitter routinely removed pro-Trump trending topics and manipulated hashtags that hurt failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the election.

Who is paying for all these buses bringing in all these protesters? Why, it¡¯s our old friend George Soros, of course. And he is playing his favorite card, the race card.

¡°For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.¡± 1 Thessalonians 5:3 (KJV) 
EDITOR¡¯S NOTE: After enduring 8 years of a pro-Muslim, anti-Israel president , you can well imagine Benjamin Netanyahu¡¯s excitement at a Donald Trump presidency. At the same time, it will be Trump¡¯s very support that God will use to usher in some dramatic fulfillment of end times events. As we have been telling you ¨C warning you ¨C for over a year now, when Trump moves the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Israel, get ready to fly. We here at NTEB believe that the move will trigger the Psalm 83 war, or worse, and that the Rapture of the Church will then be right around the corner. If you have something you want to get done for the Lord, do it now. 
In a satellite address to the Jewish Federations of North America ¡¯s annual General Assembly in Washington on Tuesday, Netanyahu urged President Barack Obama to continue America¡¯s ¡°longstanding policy¡± of supporting direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, and not pursue other avenues. Israel is concerned that Obama will use his final days in office to push for a UN Security Council resolution that will impose a two-state solution to the conflict. 
¡°I, for one, find great encouragement in the fact that there¡¯s this continuity of friendship,¡± Netanyahu said . ¡°I very much hope that President Obama will continue the policy that he enunciated,¡± Netanyahu said, referring to comments made by the outgoing president at the beginning of his first term. ¡°The only way you get a workable and enduring peace is to have the parties agree to it. This is what has happened with our peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan. PM Netanyahu Congratulates US President-Elect Donald Trump: 
¡°We¡¯ve had convulsions in the Middle East, and yet these peace treaties hold because they were directly agreed to by the parties,¡± he added. ¡°The reason we¡¯ll object to any such effort is because it will harden the Palestinian position, and because it will harden the Palestinian position, it will push peace back.¡± Netanyahu added that he is hoping to nurture the recent ¡°quiet diplomacy¡± Israel has had with Arab nations with the future Trump administration. 
The day after the Republican candidate rocked the world by winning the election, he invited Netanyahu to visit Washington at the ¡°first opportunity.¡± The prime minister and president-elect ¡°who have known each other for many years, had a warm, heartfelt conversation¡± over the phone, a statement from the Prime Minister¡¯s Office said . 
Netanyahu responded by saying that he and his wife Sara were excited to visit the incoming commander-in-chief and his wife Melania. Netanyahu congratulated Trump earlier in the day, calling the president-elect ¡°a true friend of the State of Israel.¡± Donald Trump vows to protect Israel: ¡°We will work together to advance security, stability and peace in our region,¡± Netanyahu said in a statement.

The son of the late president Shimon Peres, Chemi Peres, also congratulated Trump in his speech to the Jewish Federations General Assembly.

Ford builds the Lincoln MKC small SUV at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky alongside the Ford Escape SUV. Ford had never said it was considering shifting MKC production south of the border. But the company confirmed Friday that it had been ¡°likely¡± to move the work to Mexico in 2019 when its current contract with the United Auto Workers union expires. TRUMP FLASHBACK: Ford moving division to Mexico is a disgrace: 
This is what started the ball rolling for Trump back in the beginnings of his campaign. ¡°We had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of Louisville Assembly Plant,¡± probably to the Cuautitlan factory in Mexico, Christin Baker, a Ford spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. 
Trump has criticized Ford for planning to move all its North American small-car production to Mexico, where wages are 80 percent lower than in the U.S. Ford also builds the Lincoln MKZ sedan at a factory in Hermosillo, Mexico. During the campaign, Trump threatened to slap Ford¡¯s Mexican-built cars with a 35 percent tariff . He also said he would terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which lets goods flow between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada without tariffs. Ford Says It¡¯s Keeping Lincoln Production in Kentucky After Donald Trump Tweets 
Ford, which has expressed a willingness to work with Trump since he was elected, confirmed late Thursday it told the future president the Lincoln SUV will stay in Kentucky. 
¡°We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S.,¡± the automaker said in an e-mailed statement. 
Bill Ford met with Trump during the campaign in an unsuccessful attempt to get the candidate to stop targeting the automaker, which says it has created nearly 28,000 jobs in the U.S. during the past five years. In his first answer of the first debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Trump attacked the automaker for plans to move production of the Focus small car and C-Max hybrid from a plant in Michigan to Mexico.

In the third chapter of Joel, we read that God wages the Battle of Armageddon because people have divided up Israel, a place that He calls ""my land"". by Geoffrey Grider November 18, 2016 In the third chapter of Joel, we read that God wages the Battle of Armageddon because people have divided up Israel, a place that He calls ¡°my land¡± 
¡°They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.¡± Psalm 83:4 (KJV) 
One of Donald Trump¡¯s main campaign promises is that he would move the U.S. Embassy from its currents location in Tel Aviv, Israel, to the Old City Israeli capital of Jerusalem. See for yourself how the massive AIPAC audience erupted in frenzied cheers when he said it: 
Most people , unsaved people, honestly probably didn¡¯t even bat an eye when he said as most people don¡¯t really care about what happens in tiny, little Israel. But to the Bible believing Christian, those words rang out with a clarion call that something really big just appeared on the end times prophecy radar. Back on October 28, 2016, the headline over on jpost.com was ¡° Ivanka Trump Says Her Father Will Move US Embassy To Jerusalem ¡®100%¡¯ If Elected ¡°. 
I truly hope that President Trump will make America great again, I really do. But if you think for one moment that that¡¯s why God allowed him to be elected you are deceiving yourself. God is not concerned so much with America, He really isn¡¯t. God is concerned with His nation of Israel and with His chosen people, the Jews. In the third chapter of Joel, we read that God wages the Battle of Armageddon because people have divided up Israel, a place that He calls ¡°my land¡±. Read it for yourself: 
¡°I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.¡± Joel 3:2 (KJV) The reason why the Palestinian continue to reject the Two State Solution 
Multiple times a ¡°two state solution¡± has been offered to the Palestinian people, and every time it is offered they reject it. Why? Because in the Two State Solution, Jerusalem stays with Israel as it rightly should and infuriates the Palestinians. When Lucifer fell in Isaiah 14, it was because he was no longer satisfied with the good things that God had given him, he wanted it all. Lucifer wanted to sit in God¡¯s Seat and replace God: 
¡°For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.¡± Isaiah 14:13-15 (KJV) 
Now that you know that , can you see why there is coming such a fierce battle over Jerusalem? Because Jerusalem is God¡¯s Holy Place, the Bible calls it the ¡°city of the great King¡±. Why? Because it will be to Jerusalem that Jesus will return to as King of Kings and will rule with a ¡°rod of iron¡± over the nations. That¡¯s why. The coming battles that will take place there will be fought through humans, but it is actually a battle between God and the Devil. So now let¡¯s take a look at Psalm 83, there is a war mentioned there connected with the time of Jacob¡¯s trouble . 
¡°For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.¡± Psalm 83:5-8 (KJV) 
Look at all the nations that surround Israel to attack her , what do they all have in common? They are Muslim nations! Look at a Google map of Israel and you will see that in 2016 Israel is 100% surrounded by 100% Muslim nations. See the word Selah at the end of verse 8? That little clue tells us that the Psalm 83 War is connected with the time of Jacob¡¯s trouble. (please read our article entitled ¡° THE REAL MEANING OF THE WORD SELAH IN THE BIBLE ¡± for further insight on this issue.) THE BIBLE BELIEVERS GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RAPTURE AND THE SECOND COMING 
When Donald Trump moves the Embassy to Jerusalem , thus declaring that the United States recognizes it as Israel¡¯s capital, the entire Arab world will go crazy. We believe it is not only possible but probable that this will trigger, at some point, the Psalm 83 War. But if we are that close to that, we are even this much closer to this: The Rapture of the Church must come first 
What part of the time of Jacob¡¯s trouble will the Church be involved in? None of it. Why? Because it is the time of (write this on the chalkboard 100 times) Jacob¡¯s trouble. It has nothing to do with the church. Putting the Church of Jesus Christ into the time of Jacob¡¯s trouble ¨C Israel¡¯s trouble ¨C is nothing more than bad, old-fashioned replacement theology . If that offends you because you put the Church in Matthew 24 where it doesn¡¯t belong, then guess what? Be offended. Because stealing any of Israel¡¯s promises, including the negative ones, is replacement theology. 
If we are really this close to the time of Jacob¡¯s trouble and the Psalm 83 War, then we are really, really close to the time of the Pretribulation Rapture of the Church . A sobering thought, isn¡¯t it? Donald Trump¡¯s miracle win was really just that ¨C a miracle. But it was a miracle with a purpose , to accomplish God¡¯s will and plan in these end times. We have been saying this to anyone who will listen for well over a year now. 
Have you ever stopped to consider the physical structure of the word ¡®Jerusalem¡¯? Take a closer look ¨C Jer USA lem. Now what do you see? 
For the Bible believer and prophecy watcher , we are most certainly living in exciting times. Perhaps the most exciting since May 14, 1948 . 
Are YOU ready for what comes next?

EDITOR¡¯S NOTE: Donald Trump made promises that a majority of the American people clearly identified with, one of which was his promise to #DrainTheSwamp .

Some Trump supporters and allies have tried to steer the President-elect from nominating Romney as the U.S.¡¯s chief diplomat.

Consultant Jesse Benton of the pro-Trump Great America Super PAC was just caught on camera admitting that he and his associates have been conducting a voter suppression campaign targeting African-Americans and women. 
¡°In Cleveland, if we can return Hillary to normal turnout levels ¡­ we can turn her to regular turnout levels she¡¯s gonna lose about 60,000 votes in that area ¨C that¡¯s dead heat.

Benton is the same Trump operative who was convicted of purchasing the vote of an Iowa state Senator and was recently busted attempting to funnel $2 million in illegal donations from a Chinese donor who turned out to be an undercover Telegraph reporter. 
The Donald Trump campaign has been accusing anybody who dares to speak against them ¨C the Clinton campaign, the media, polling organizations ¨C of ¡°rigging¡± the election against them.

Since the Republicans can¡¯t win this game, they have elected to change the rules instead, by passing restrictive voter ID laws that disenfranchise a large number of voters ¨C especially minorities ¨C from exercising their right to vote, closing down polling stations. 
They justify this in an underhanded appeal to ¡°protecting the integrity¡± of our democracy by waving the imaginary specter of ¡°voter fraud¡± over the nation¡¯s head.

His ill-conceived lie has propelled the progressive filmmaker¡¯s ¡®October Surprise¡¯ movie straight to the very top of the iTunes charts with almost 8 million views today, prompting the famed filmmaker to embark on a tweetstorm mocking the Trump supporters for helping shine the spotlight on his film.

¡ª Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 26, 2016 
Snopes had already busted Milo¡¯s gross misrepresentation, which used audio from Moore¡¯s movie without context or follow through to make it appear as if Moore had endorsed Trump ¨C a charge which Moore has loudly debunked. 
First of all, I make it very clear: I wrote a chapter in my very first book 20 years ago [1996¡¯s Downsize This! ] called ¡°My Forbidden Love for Hillary.¡± There¡¯s nothing to come around on. I was for Hillary before Hillary was for Hillary. I didn¡¯t go to convert Trump people. I did not want the racists or the crazies in there or we would have never gotten the show done. But we went to union halls and guys that I grew up with ¡ª people who normally vote Democrat who are thinking of voting for Trump. That is a huge chunk of the population, especially where I¡¯m from. So I wasn¡¯t there so much to convert them away. I don¡¯t think a lot of them necessarily decided for sure that they were going to vote for him. But I want them to think about the damage they could do by being a legal terrorist on November 8th. 
That didn¡¯t stop Milo from broadcasting this video containing a clip from Moore¡¯s movie which has gotten over 6 million views, but without publishing the entire narrative which explained how a vote for Trump might feel good in the short term like Brexiteers imagined their votes might feel this past summer. Moore¡¯s point is that Trump¡¯s populist rhetoric sounds good, but his economic ideas and 19th century tariffs would be terribly damaging to American business, and ultimately to workers. 
If you keep watching the movie immediately after the part that Milo cited, then you would actually hear this dire warning by Michael Moore about the abject danger of electing the Republican candidate who¡¯d like to end the First Amendment, destroy America¡¯s economy and bring Jim Crow out of the dark past of the deep south and parade him around the entire United States. This is how Moore described the severe buyer¡¯s remorse felt by Brexit voters: 
[Voting for Trump will feel good] for a day. Maybe a week. Possibly a month. And then. Like the Brits, who wanted to send a message, so they voted to leave Europe only to find out that if you vote to leave Europe you, actually have to leave Europe. And now they regret it. All the Ohioans, Pennsylvanians, Michiganders and Wisconsinites of Middle England, right, they all voted to leave and now they regret it. 
And over 4 million of them signed a petition to have a do-over, they want another election, but It¡¯s not going to happen. Because you used the ballot as an anger management tool. And now you¡¯re fucked. And the rest of Europe. They¡¯re like, Bye Felicia. So when the rightfully angry people of Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin find out after a few months in office that President Trump wasn¡¯t going to do a damn thing for them, it will be too late to do anything about it. 
But I get it. You wanted to send a message. You had righteous anger. And justifiable anger. Well, message sent. Goodnight America. You¡¯ve just elected the last president of the United States. 
Once again a simple fact check shows that a widely conservative writer is lying to his audience by taking video out of context to make an argument that is entirely divorced from the actual facts. Michael Moore would never endorse a candidate like Donald Trump or his Republican friends that share his values and lie to America¡¯s working people about their multi-decade campaign to deliver more money to the top 1% of American households at the expense of 99% of our country¡¯s population.",english,2016-10-26T23:39:05.864+03:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,Trump Jr. Thinks Michael Moore Endorsed His Dad.

It¡¯s an understatement to say that Republican nominee Donald Trump does not have a good record when it comes to charity and donating to good causes. But as the death knell sounds for his campaign, he still isn¡¯t changing his miserly ways. New reports indicate that Trump graciously allowed the Palm Beach Boys & Girls Club to hold a fundraiser at the Trump International Golf Course in Florida ¨C and then charged them $20,000 for the favor. 
¡°This ¡®free¡¯ event is costing us $20,000 between golf and catering fees. What we had hoped for as far as a ¡®net¡¯ income for this event has been cut in half (if we are lucky)¡± complained Mark Casale, vice president of philanthropy for the Boys and Girls Clubs. 
The course usually charges around $5,000 and leaves the county off the hook for the rest, but not this time. The annual charitable tournament goes to a different organization every year; it just so happens that this year¡¯s choice was made by District 6 commissioner Melissa McKinlay ¨C who is a Democrat. 
¡°None of this was disclosed to me when given the choice to select a charity. I was under the impression the charity was able to host the event without any charges. Explain to me how this is supposed to be a benefit to the county?¡± demanded McKinlay in an email. ¡°If I were the Boys & Girls Club, I would pull out. How are smaller charities supposed to be able to afford this? This has placed me and the charity in a very bad position and I am quite upset by it.¡± 
Neither the Trump International Golf Course nor the Trump campaign have responded to requests for comment. 
Washington Post reporter David Farenthold has undertaken a minutely detailed investigation into Donald Trump¡¯s charitable past ¨C and found that he has donated far less than he claims to have give n. Most of the money Trump has ¡°donated¡± was donated to the Trump Foundation by other donors; many charities ¨C including those belonging to veterans¡¯ organizations ¨C were promised donations that were never paid out . It¡¯s been discovered that the ¡°Trump Foundation¡± was never properly certified to solicit donations in the first place, and Farenthold¡¯s research shows that Trump has been using his ¡°charitable foundation¡± to launder money through to evade millions in taxes.

Yet another woman has stepped forward to accuse Republican nominee Donald Trump of sexual assault. Ninni Laaksonen, crowned the 2006 Miss Finland , has become the fourteenth woman to come forward and accuse Trump of unwanted advances. Speaking to local newspaper Ilta-Sanomat, Laaksonen described how moments before she was set to appear on the Late Show With David Letterman , Trump came up to her and began groping her buttocks. 
¡°¡°Before the show we were photographed outside the building. Trump stood right next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt. I don¡¯t think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought: ¡®What is happening?¡¯¡±

Republican nominee Donald J. Trump has been very vocal about his creepy sexual fetishization of his daughter Ivanka ¨C and yet another deeply uncomfortable video has surfaced of him hitting on his daughter. 
During a 2013 tapping of the ¡° Wendy Williams Show ,¡± Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka appeared together as guests. 
Wendy asked each to name what they have in common, during a reoccurring segment called ¡°Fave Five.¡± While Ivanka safely and logically responded, ¡°real estate¡± and ¡°golf.¡± Trump, however, gave the game an incestual twist, replying ¡°Sex.¡± 
Considering Donald J. Trump¡¯s record at subjecting Ivanka to his perversion, this shouldn¡¯t even be surprising, but it is absolutely disgusting. It is shocking and just plain gross. In 2006, Trump allowed Howard Stern the go-ahead to call Ivanka a ¡° piece of ass ,¡± and agreed with this assessment (no pun intended) of his daughter. 
That same year he went on ¡° The View ,¡± telling the ladies that he wouldn¡¯t disparage he posing for ¡°Playboy¡± and that if she wasn¡¯t his daughter he would be dating her. In 2003, he appeared with buddy Howard Stern, bragging about how his daughter¡¯s has the ¡° best body ,¡± saying: ¡°You know who¡¯s one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka. She¡¯s 6 feet tall, she¡¯s got the best body. She made a lot money as a model¡ªa tremendous amount.¡± 
Trump¡¯s lack of discretion when referring to Ivanka is very, very weird and further proves that Trump is only capable of putting the women he interacts with into two camps: those he would have sex with and those he wouldn¡¯t. That Ivanka is his daughter does not change this. She is a woman he would have sex with, and nothing more. He pitifully can¡¯t even name anything they have in common. All that comes to mind is, as admitted by him, is sex. 
Maybe Republicans should spend their time investigating Trump possibly molesting members of his own family instead of trying to needlessly take down Clinton, before her term (inevitably) starts.

The Democratic National Committee just hauled Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee into a federal court demanding that they cease the program of minority voter intimidation that Trump has inspiring his supporters to carry out. The DNC¡¯s lawyers asked a New Jersey federal judge to hold the Republican Party in contempt for violating a 35-year old consent decree to enforce the Voting Rights Act, and to issue an injunction to enforce the terms of the agreement, which will force Republicans to cease their efforts to suppress votes in minority communities during this year¡¯s general election. The DNC lawyers cited Donald Trump¡¯s frequent statements to supporters, as well as one of vice presidential nominee Mike Pence¡¯s speeches where he admitted that the RNC was directly coordinating ¡°ballot integrity¡± initiatives, which are explicitly banned under the agreement. 
Trump¡¯s overt actions to call his supporters to watch polls in ¡°certain areas¡± are a classic attempt to concoct an illegal ¡°ballot security program,¡± which is why we exclusively predicted this lawsuit could happen three weeks ago. Last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) weighed in with an op-ed published in the Washington Post urging the party to take action. This week, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump also took it upon themselves to lodge a new FBI complaint , over Trump¡¯s voter suppression campaign which violates the same Voting Rights Act provisions covered by this recent DNC action which could land Republicans involved in the illegal campaigning ¨C like Roger Stone ¨C in criminal court. However, the Democratic Party¡¯s action is based on a legal decision, so it¡¯s going to be expedited in court, and is likely to yield a rapid order from the federal judge against the Republican party and Trump. 
Here¡¯s a summary of what the DNC¡¯s lawyers filed in federal court today: (see below for complete document ) 
Defendant Republican National Committee (¡°RNC¡±) has violated the Final Consent Decree¡­ by supporting and enabling the efforts of the Republican candidate for President, Donald J. Trump, as well as his campaign and advisors, to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 Presidential Election. Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be ¡°rigged¡± based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in ¡°certain areas¡± or ¡°certain sections¡± of key states. 
Unsurprisingly, those ¡°certain areas¡± are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside. Notwithstanding that no evidence of such fraud actually exists, Trump has encouraged his supporters to do whatever it takes to stop it¡ª¡°You¡¯ve got to get everybody to go out and watch . . . and when [I] say ¡®watch,¡¯ you know what I¡¯m talking about, right?¡±¡ªand has been actively organizing ¡°election observers¡± to monitor polling stations in ¡°certain areas.¡± Trump has even encouraged his ¡°watchers¡± to act like vigilante law enforcement officers. 
Although certain RNC officials have attempted to distance themselves from some of the Trump campaign¡¯s more recent statements, there is now ample evidence that Trump has enjoyed the direct and tacit support of the RNC in its ¡°ballot security¡± endeavors, including the RNC¡¯s collaboration on efforts to prevent this supposed ¡°rigging¡± and ¡°voter fraud.¡± 
In a rally in Denver, Colorado, on August 3, 2016, Trump¡¯s vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, admitted that the RNC was directly coordinating with the Trump campaign on ¡°ballot integrity¡± initiatives, stating that ¡°the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee are working very very closely with state governments and secretaries of states all over the country to ensure ballot integrity.¡± 
The RNC¡¯s support of Trump¡¯s efforts to recruit ¡°watchers¡± who are intended to intimidate voters at their polling places violates this Court¡¯s Consent Decree as modified in 2009, which explicitly forbid the RNC from engaging in so-called ¡°ballot security¡± measures directly, indirectly, or through its agents or employees. The RNC¡¯s conduct also violates the Consent Decree under well settled law prohibiting defendants from evading court orders by acting in concert with third parties. 
Donald Trump¡¯s master of dirty tricks, Roger Stone is specifically named in the complaint because is the very same political operative, whose minority voter intimidation tactics landed the Republican party in hot water for 35 years in the first place for rigging a close New Jersey gubernatorial election! (which was won by the GOP candidate) 
Roger Stone, one of Trump¡¯s top advisors, has amplified Trump¡¯s message. Stone was a key advisor to the 1981 campaign of former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, in which a ¡°ballot security¡± force wearing black armbands engaged in widespread voter intimidation in Newark, Camden, Paterson and other minority neighborhoods in the State, leading to this very action and the Consent Decree that Stone is helping to violate today. 
Stone is currently running a website called ¡°StopTheSteal.org¡± that is actively signing up Trump supporters to ¡°volunteer¡± to fight ¡°voter fraud.¡± #StopTheSteal is a popular hashtag among Trump supporters on Twitter, and Stone¡¯s group maintains an active Facebook presence. On October 23, 2016, Stone sent out a (now deleted) message via his Twitter feed deliberately designed to mislead Democratic voters by representing¡ªusing Secretary Hillary Clinton¡¯s likeness and logo¡ªthat supporters can ¡°VOTE the NEW way on Tues. Nov 8th¡± by texting ¡°HILLARY to 8888,¡± after which voters would apparently ¡°receive official confirmation. 
Even worse, Roger Stone is trying to hide his voter suppression plan behind the facade of exit polling. DNC lawyers slammed the lunatic Republican political operative for his deception, and the court could order him to jail for contempt of court for his behavior. 
Stone is also using social media to promote the common plan that Trump supporters¡ªand particularly those who have agreed to engage in vigilante ¡°ballot security¡± efforts¡ªwear red shirts on Election Day. Further Stone is actively recruiting Trump supporters for ¡°exit polling,¡± specifically targeting nine Democratic-leaning cities with large minority populations. This ¡°exit polling¡± serves no legitimate purpose: Stone does not run a polling operation. Rather, the plain purpose of this plan is to intimidate minority voters. 
If Donald Trump does not cease his open calls for voter intimidation, the DNC¡¯s legal action could land him in contempt of court ¨C and facing a jail term. 
The RNC is working in active concert with Trump, the Trump campaign, and [Roger] Stone to intimidate and harass minority voters in violation of this Court¡¯s Consent Decree. The Court should use its inherent contempt powers to remedy those violations , and enforce future compliance with the Consent Decree, with sanctions. 
Upon a finding that the RNC has violated the Consent Decree, this Court should issue an order extending the Consent Decree for another eight years, according to the terms of the Decree. 
Republicans have spent a massive amount of time and money litigating to escape this Consent Decree just seven years ago, and obtained a new concession to limit it¡¯s term from infinite ¨C which they agreed to in the 1980s ¨C down to an eight year term which would¡¯ve expired next December. Now that the DNC has taken Trump and the Republican Party back to court, it¡¯s very likely that the terms of the decree will be extended for another eight years through 2025, which will take it through the next two Presidential election cycles. 
Donald Trump has wasted the entire last month complaining about a ¡°rigged election¡± and encouraging vigilante poll watchers to visit minority neighborhoods. Now, a federal judge will have to step in to keep his campaign from breaking election laws across the country, and the Republican party will pay the price for his ignorance of election law for years to come. 
¡°The notion of widespread voter fraud in modern American politics is itself a fraud,¡± said the DNC, ¡°Every attempt to verify the presence of voter fraud has proven fruitless.¡±

With Donald Trump obsesses over Hillary Clinton¡¯s e-mail ¡°scandal¡±, one wonders why he never mentions the Bush Administration and the April 12, 2007 revelation that the White House had ¡°lost¡± 5 million e-mails related to an investigation into the partisan firing of eight U.S. attorneys . Eventually, the true number was found to be over 22 million e-mails. 
Salon reports that: 
The emails had been run through private accounts controlled by the Republican National Committee and were only supposed to be used for dealing with non-administration political campaign work to avoid violating ethics laws. Yet congressional investigators already had evidence private emails had been used for government business, including to discuss the firing of one of the U.S. attorneys. The RNC accounts were used by 22 White House staffers, including then-Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, who reportedly used his RNC email for 95 percent of his communications. 
According to the Washington Post, ¡°Under federal law, the White House is required to maintain records, including e-mails, involving presidential decision- making and deliberations.¡± But, of course, these millions of e-mails went missing ¡ª many of which were important evidence. 
Most troubling, researchers found a suspicious pattern in the White House email system blackouts, including periods when there were no emails available from the office of Vice President Dick Cheney. 
¡®¡°That the vice president¡¯s office, widely characterized as the most powerful vice president in history, should have no archived emails in its accounts for scores of days¡ªespecially days when there was discussion of whether to invade Iraq¡ªbeggared the imagination,¡± says Thomas Blanton, director of the Washington-based National Security Archive. The NSA (not to be confused with the National Security Agency, the federal surveillance organization) is a nonprofit devoted to obtaining and declassifying national security documents and is one of the key players in the effort to recover the supposedly lost Bush White House emails. 
As Rove and others were investigated for the partisan ¡°unmasking¡± of Valerie Plame, a CIA black market specialist, it came to light that Rove¡¯s server was used for official communications ¡ª the exact sort required to be preserved under the Presidential Records Act. 
¡°I wouldn¡¯t rule out that there were a potential 5 million e-mails lost,¡± White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said at the time. By 2009, it was revealed that Perino¡¯s numbers were a little off when 22 million missing e-mails were discovered. 
The partisan nature of this Clinton email investigation is obvious. How is it not relevant that an administration notorious for committing war crimes and crimes against humanity was able to delete millions of emails without a word from Congress? For all their so called concern for our national security, the Republican Party has an appalling double standard.",english,2016-10-29T02:38:30.627+03:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,Trump Won¡¯t Mention That Bush & Cheney Deleted 22 Million Emails,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-10-10-at-6.33.34-PM-1.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

A new federal government document has surfaced which details the housing discrimination practices of Donald Trump and his family¡¯s vast Trump Organization¡¯s realty holdings in New York City¡¯s outer boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. 
It¡¯s the first time that tangible proof of Donald Trump¡¯s history of racial discrimination practices has been confirmed in an official record. 
  found this key document from the archives of University of Michigan¡¯s Law School, markgin the very first time that the complete list of Trump¡¯s covered properties has been discovered. 
The Republican nominee spent most of the 1970s battling federal housing discrimination charges alongside his father, a fact Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton highlighted in an attack ad this week . 
However, Trump has always publicly denied culpability and hid behind the confidentiality of settlement discussions to avoid full disclosure like this new public record document exposes. In fact, he has always never admitted guilt, according to Politifact : 
The case was settled and Trump never admitted guilt, though his company had to agree to stipulations meant to prevent future discrimination at his rental properties. Donald Trump¡¯s Properties Had 75% Fewer Minorities Than Lived Nearby In Other Buildings 
The Trump Organization had 9,050 apartment units covered under the settlement agreement with the federal government, which housed only 399 minority residents across 35 covered properties, or only 4.4% of Fred and Donald Trump¡¯s New York City rental real estate empire. 
The public record document proves the Trump Organization and principals Fred and Donald Trump¡¯s buildings schemed to ignore the Fair Housing Act of 1968 but failed miserably and ultimately landed in court for two years starting in 1973. 
The Trumps eventually capitulated to the government in 1975. 
Keep in mind, the federal government named Donald Trump personally in their Fair Housing complaint, so he wasn¡¯t just a bit player in the dark history of his family business¡¯ illegal management practices ¡ª but a named defendant. 
The Justice Department named 39 buildings in their original complaint, which leading to a story entitled, ¡° Major Landlord Accused of Antiblack Bias ,¡± on the front page of the New York Times. 
Out of the total of 14,000 units that The Times says the Trump family owned in 1973, 68% of their holdings fell under the settlement. 
The Trumps segregated a small group of non-white tenants into a few of their properties, maintained a single building with just over half minority residents, and virtually excluded minorities from 24 New York City buildings of the 36 total project covered in their 1975 settlement with the federal government which covered a mind-boggling 9,500 apartments. 
Five of the Trump buildings affected had no minority residents whatsoever, and more than half of the buildings had less than ten minority residents. 
There¡¯s also spreadsheet below with easier to read copy of the key public record document proving Trump¡¯s discriminatory housing practices, but you can see the original here: 
Who Wrote This Letter At The Department of Justice Civil Rights Division And Why Did They Write It? 
Drew S. Days, III transmitted the Trump Leak (below) to the Open Housing Center of New York shortly after his appointment by President Carter. It was prepared by career Civil Rights division lawyer Harvey L. Hanley in the summer of 1977, 
Days , was the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights division then, where he personally oversaw the Trump family¡¯s desegregation efforts. 
He went on to become a Yale Law Professor, and eventually the US Solicitor General under President Clinton in 1993. 
Days¡¯ memo reveals that the portfolio of Trump Organization realty which was covered in the 1975 settlement, and their slow progress of racial integration as of July 11th, 1977. 
By then, the Trump Organization had designated two additional buildings to accommodate significant blocks minority renters compared to other buildings. 
But across the board, non-white occupancy rates only went from 4.4% to 7.2% with 663 residents of color housed. 
When you factor out those two buildings ¨C named Argyle Hall and Westminster Hall who accepted 48 of only 264 new minority tenants ¨C the Trump Organization¡¯s overall minority occupancy rate stood at only 6.45%. Trump Organization Management Actively Discriminated Against African-Americans 
The New York Times reported in August that Trump¡¯s property managers ¨C both New York and Cincinnati, Ohio ¨C marked minority housing applications for denial whether they were segregationists or more likely following their orders strictly. One manager spilled the beans on Trump¡¯s discriminatory practices: 
A former Trump superintendent named Thomas Miranda testified that multiple Trump Management employees had instructed him to attach a separate piece of paper with a big letter ¡°C¡± on it ¡ª for ¡°colored¡± ¡ª to any application filed by a black apartment-seeker. 
That wasn¡¯t only reason to date why the federal Department of Justice¡¯s Civil Rights division monitored fully 2/3rds of the Trump family¡¯s realty empire for racial discrimination in the 70s. 
Case records like the one provided by DCAT below show that Trump¡¯s manager would tell prospective tenants that their neighborhoods were safe, ¡°because there were no blacks around.¡± 
Furthermore, as in many housing discrimination cases, the below court document also documents testers visiting the Trump Organization¡¯s buildings and coming out with different results based on the skin color of the prospective tenant.

It¡¯s important to note that demographic data from the US Census illuminates this report to show that most of Trump¡¯s buildings had far fewer minorities than the communities in which they sat. 
US Census data indicates that Kings and Queens Counties were the two most populous counties in New York back then, with 4.6 million people in 1970. (doc 2, page 11 in link) US Census Data. Click to Open in New Tab 
Roughly 20% of that 1970 population was listed as African-American. 
By the 1980 US Census , the population of the two New York City boroughs dipped slightly, however the percentage of African-American and hispanic residents in the two boroughs was 40% of the population. (pages 29-30 in link) 
This data demonstrates that the Trump Organization¡¯s covered apartments only had one fourth of the proportion of minority residents compared their surrounding neighborhoods in the mid-1970s, while 15% percent of their properties had zero African-Americans residing inside them. 
For the purposes of this story, we used the blended average of minority population in both districts, since there¡¯s a large portfolio of buildings. Conclusion 
Donald Trump settled a federal Fair Housing Act lawsuit because most of his buildings often had few, or even no minority residents. 
A careful examination of his record shows that his family¡¯s real estate empire systematically excluded African-Americans from its housing, and even after settling with the US Department of Justice, the Trump Organization continued to use the same tactics of loading just a few properties with most of the minority tenants.",english,2016-10-29T20:08:56.161+03:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,A Leaked Memo Just Proved Trump¡¯s Housing Discrimination In New York City,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-10-29-at-12.16.02-PM.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

¡ª West Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) October 29, 2016 Newsweek¡¯s report about this latest non-scandal points out firmly that the FBI Director¡¯s letter literally points out emails that have nothing to do with the Democratic nominee. 
The disclosure by the Federal Bureau of Investigation late on Friday, October 28 that it had discovered potential new evidence in its inquiry into Hillary Clinton¡¯s handling of her personal email when she was Secretary of State has virtually nothing to do with any actions taken by the Democratic nominee, according to government records and an official with knowledge of the investigation, who spoke to Newsweek on condition of anonymity. The revelation that the FBI has discovered additional emails convulsed the political world, and led to widespread (and erroneous) claims and speculation. 
Moreover, despite the widespread claims in the media that this development had prompted the FBI to ¡°reopen¡± of the case, it did not; What we know: FBI found some emails on a new device. They dont know whats in them or if they're copies or if they're classified. That's it.

The FBI has a difficult job to perform in the best of times, and when it comes to political investigations agents must walk a tightrope between performing their duties properly, and unduly influencing public opinion with the results of their investigations. For an entire year, they managed to quietly, but diligently investigate the sensitive matters surrounding Hillary Clinton¡¯s emails which they ultimately concluded, ¡°were not a cliff-hanger¡± because there was literally no there, there. 
These events show precisely why the FBI does not ordinarily publicly release the results or targets of their investigations until charges are filed. 
These memos have set off a chain off events sure to end with the termination of his tenure as head of the agency. A serious criminal complaint has already been levied against him by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump for engaging in partisan activity.

Republicans often talk about yard signs in their neighborhood as proof of their candidate¡¯s fitness for office, but a photograph of one Florida resident¡¯s Trump sign with lynched black people hanging from a tree has gone viral. It¡¯s a terrifying reminder of the pervasive racial hatred pitched by Donald Trump¡¯s new Republican Party, which he normalized by accepting the endorsement of former KKK chief David Duke and by leading the ¡°alt-right¡± movement to Make America Discriminatory Again. 
Miami¡¯s New Times reports : There needs to be a hell of a lot of hate in your heart to think lynching people on Halloween is funny. And yet, here we are, Miami. A homeowner in Three Lakes, a small community in suburban Kendall, is celebrating the holiday by lynching two black-looking dummies in his or her yard. It¡¯s also impossible to ignore what¡¯s just in front of the display on the same lawn: A ¡°Trump/Pence 2016¡± sign. 
The two men are faceless, but their skin appears to be dark. They¡¯re each wearing traditionally ¡°hip-hop¡± clothing: One of the dead men has a sports jersey on and a crooked baseball cap, and the other has his pants sagged low. Black activists have been circulating the photos on Facebook all day and calling for a quick response from the neighborhood. The community¡¯s property manager, Orelys Canas, tells New Times they¡¯ve contacted the homeowner and asked him or her to remove the installation. 
After the story went viral, the homeowner contacted the local news to pretend that his lynching display was actually some form of tolerance. They also claimed that the Trump/Pence sign didn¡¯t even belong to them, but other tipsters made it clear that the entire display clearly depicted a lynching scene with a Trump sign. 
Trump supporters instantly bombarded the news editors who published the chilling photos: Well it took exactly ten minutes for a guy to suggest Hillary planted the lynched black dummies at a Trump supporter's house #wakeupsheeple pic.twitter.com/MbIoC0PQds

A suburban Detroit homeowner and Trump supporter just took the Republican Party platform and proudly displayed it on his front lawn, creating a despicably terrifying display of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton sitting in a mock electric chair, screaming in agony as she is executed. 
The photo of the offensive display was taken by a reader in Waterford Township, a suburb northwest of Detroit which is 89% populated by white residents. It¡¯s unknown if authorities have been alerted, but this display is the end result of months of extremist electioneering by the Trump and Republican Party, who have been hell-bent on dehumanizing   
American politics never had a tradition of demanding the jailing of one¡¯s political opponent, nor to encouragement of supporters to engage in political violence, but that¡¯s today¡¯s Republican Party under Donald Trump. His campaign has broken America¡¯s political taboos with open calls for violence, even winding up under Secret Service investigation twice. Trump himself drew an unprecedented public scolding from the Secret Service for saying that ¡° second amendment people ¡± should take matters into their own hands if/when he Hillary beats him.

Donald Trump, the draft-dodging Russophile who cloaks his xenophobia and bigotry in a veneer of false patriotism, reportedly had to ask what a Gold Star family was after he attacked the Muslim-American parents of war hero Capt. Humayun Khan. Trump has thus once again proven his patriotic rhetoric to be nothing but ignorant and self-serving bombast. 
The Trump-Khan feud arose after Khizr Khan, Capt. Khan¡¯s father, gave a powerful speech at the Democratic National Convention over the summer repudiating Trump¡¯s hateful anti-Muslim rhetoric. Khan said that Trump had ¡°sacrificed nothing¡± while he and his wife had paid the ultimate sacrifice for America, and famously held up his pocket-size Constitution and offered to lend it to Trump. Trump, who seems physically incapable of responding to criticism with anything other than blustering attacks, went on a tirade against Mr. Khan, adding for good measure that his wife Ghazala was not allowed to speak at the DNC because she is a Muslim. 
When one of Trump¡¯s advisers warned him against attacking a Gold Star family, Trump reportedly responded, ¡°what¡¯s that?¡± Paul Manafort, Trump¡¯s campaign manager at the time, apparently had to repeatedly explain to the candidate that a Gold Star family is a family that has lost a loved one serving in war. In a surprising bit of pushback from a Trump campaign staff that seems to consist overwhelmingly of yes men, Manafort reportedly told Trump in response to his feud with Khan that the election ¡°is about the American people, it¡¯s not about you.¡± 
That Trump has the audacity to criticize war heros like Capt. Khan and Sen. John McCain after using his privilege to avoid war and knowing nothing of their sacrifice, that he is so presumptuous as to adopt the mantle of fighting for America while knowing nothing about American institutions, is proof that he is nothing but an opportunistic demagogue who will say anything to appease his own ego. In stark contrast to Trump¡¯s sleaze, however, Khizr Khan has, in the best American tradition, taken the high road. 
Khan has continued to speak out for American values and against Trump¡¯s hate-peddling. Last week he said that ¡°there comes a time in an ordinary citizen¡¯s life where you have to gather all the courage you have and you stand up and speak against tyranny and speak against un-American hate.¡± Khan has continued to get under Trump¡¯s skin, with the nominee replying to that speech with the hackneyed lie that he opposed the Iraq war.

Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid just sent a scathing open letter to FBI Director James Comey, calling him out for smearing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton while hiding a sinister truth about Donald Trump that the public deserves to know. In it, he accuses the controversial FBI Director of sitting on secret ¡°explosive¡± intelligence information about the Republican presidential campaign¡¯s coordination with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. Reid wrote : 
The double standard established by your actions is clear. 
In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government ¨C a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information. 
By contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible. Moreover, in tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo, you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own Department. 
You rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton. 
Senator Reid continued by notifying Comey of violating the Hatch Act, whic forbids federal employees from engaging in partisan acts. Even further, Reid said that he regretted helping President Obama break a long Republican filibuster of his nomination to head the FBI just three short years ago. 
It¡¯s not surprising that there is a tangible link between Putin and Trump, especially after an interview of the Republican claiming he has a relationship with the Russian dictator was unearthed by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump and authenticated by MSNBC host Thomas A. Roberts this week .

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He¡¯s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he¡¯s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord. 
Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. ¡°For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia¡± he tweeted in July. Now ¨C brace yourself, this might come as a shock ¨C it appears he¡¯s been lying to us the whole time. 
An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has ¡°numerous ties¡± to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. ¡°The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars ¡ª what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate¡ª[and] be associated with Donald Trump¡± says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group. 
Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to ¡°large numbers¡± of Russian buyers ¨C so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as ¡°Little Moscow.¡± 
The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion . 
The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense ¨C they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth. 
¡°I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption¡­They don¡¯t read books. They don¡¯t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht¡± says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev , who went on to describe them as ¡°cultural ignoramuses¡­not interested in social justice.¡± Sound like anyone we know? 
When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow¡¯s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves ¨C and Trump himself. ¡°We¡¯ll be looking at that, yeah we¡¯ll be looking¡± said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July. 
These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it¡¯s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

After the reignition of the Hillary Clinton ¡¯email scandal,¡± the polls indicate that 63% of Americans still don¡¯t give a damn about Hillary Clinton¡¯s emails. 
The House Republicans¡¯ final gambit is the worst example of grasping at straws, and only days later yet the American people are signaling that yet another attempt to revive the Clinton email non-scandal has failed, miserably. 
Recent reports say 21 million early votes have already been cast in this year¡¯s election, which represents roughly 1/6th of the total cast in the 2012 general election and none of those votes will be impacted by the FBI Director¡¯s memo. 
Today, The Guardian reports that voters¡¯ minds are already mostly made up about Clinton¡¯s emails, and recent disclosures are having more impact among Republicans and other groups already not pre-disposed to vote for the Democratic nominee. 
¡°About a third of likely voters say they are less likely to support Clinton given FBI director James Comey¡¯s disclosure,¡± said pollster Gary Langer . ¡°Given other considerations, 63% say it makes no difference.¡± 
Many loyalists are convinced the latest trove of emails, discovered on equipment shared by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner, are an irrelevance. Even if some show more classified information passed its way through the private server, it should not change the FBI¡¯s earlier decision that a criminal charge would be unfair without evidence of intent or coverup. But so long as this is not categorically established, there may be a nagging doubt in some minds that the FBI suspects otherwise. 
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders destroyed the issue of Hillary Clinton¡¯s emails early in the Democratic primary campaign, noting that they¡¯re a giant pile of minutiae and that the American people are more concerned about economic fairness, trade policies and the corrosive effect of Citizens United on our politics. Famously, he said: 
Let me say something that may not be good politics, but the Secretary is right. People and America are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails. 
The American people aren¡¯t buying Trump¡¯s lies about the FBI Director¡¯s vague memo ¨C written entirely without actual facts ¨C signifies anything other than a DC game being played by House Republicans. Even CNN¡¯s New Day plainly says at the start of this video plainly that, ¡°Trump is Lying.¡± 
Republicans are in familiar territory after having run a divisive and needlessly incendiary political campaign this year, and stuck focusing on literally any little thing they can find about the Democratic nominee to distract voters from the real issues.

A bombshell report from CNBC confirms that FBI Director James Comey had in fact concluded that the government of the Russian Federation was interfering with the election, but fought to keep that information from being released to the public because it was ¡°too close to the election.¡± 
Instead, Comey prevented the name FBI from appearing on the statement the government ultimately made on October 7th. 
This attitude stands in stark contrast to the cavalier way in which Director Comey threw a wrench into the election by writing a letter to ¡°update¡± Congress on the Hillary Clinton email investigation since the FBI discovered emails that ¡°may¡± be pertinent to their previous inquiries. 
That announcement has drastically shifted the polling landscape of the election and given the Republican Party the final stretch ammunition that the Donald Trump campaign, sinking after weeks of sexual assault revelations, needed to bail themselves out and redirect the national narrative away from their own bad press. 
The hypocrisy is astounding; it appears that the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation attempted to hide the machinations by a foreign power to interfere in the elections of the United States to protect the Republican nominee, who has a long documented history with the operatives of said foreign power and a personally profitable reason to cultivate their support. 
The Director then said that he couldn¡¯t release that information to the public ¨C which definitely deserves to know if a foreign power is interfering with our electoral process ¨C because it was ¡°too close to the election¡± but then releases an intentionally vague and misleading letter concerning new emails that ¡°may or may not be¡± pertinent to an investigation which the FBI itself had already exonerated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over?

A private group of technical experts has reviewed meta-data about the Trump Organization¡¯s internet usage and just concluded that the Republican nominee is using a personal email server to surreptitiously communicate from the Trump-email.com domain with a controversial Moscow-based bank, Alfa Bank. 
The timing of the Russian communications coincides perfectly with milestones throughout the election (see chart at bottom), and the very high level of secrecy deployed to hide them is going to be hard to explain away for the Trump campaign. 
Adding fuel to the building controversy, when researchers contacted Alfa Bank for comment, the Trump Organization quickly shut down the server: 
The Times hadn¡¯t yet been in touch with the Trump campaign¡ªLichtblau spoke with the campaign a week later¡ªbut shortly after it reached out to Alfa, the Trump domain name in question seemed to suddenly stop working. 
The computer scientists believe there was one logical conclusion to be drawn: The Trump Organization shut down the server after Alfa was told that the Times might expose the connection. Weaver told me the Trump domain was ¡°very sloppily removed.¡± Or as another of the researchers put it, it looked like ¡°the knee was hit in Moscow, the leg kicked in New York.¡± 
But with their eyes watching, the Trump Organization casually re-connected with Alfa Bank only four days later, on a different server. All of this was captured in the Domain Name System (DNS), which is the internet¡¯s internal directory system. DNS leaves log records all over saying how often website visits happen, and it¡¯s the very same web services which was attacked last week , taking down Twitter, The New York Times and others. DNS is the system that routes our internet requests using names instead of numbers, and it keeps logs with IP address numbers and timestamps. 
In this case, the meta-data practically screams to experts, because it shows that there is little other traffic of any other kind by design. As we learned from Edward Snowden, the meta-data of a situation is incomplete, but it can tell you a lot. 
The new domain is owned by one of Trump¡¯s hospitality marketing contract companies, which dispels Trump¡¯s blown cover story that the private server is just used for marketing. 
Domain registration information also confirmed that the same marketing team works on both Trump-email.com and the new client-contact.com email addresses being used. Furthermore, the world-renowned technical expert Paul Vixie revealed that the Trump Organization went to extra-ordinary lengths to shut out all traffic that isn¡¯t from Alfa Bank. 
There is a more sinister reason for creating a private email server that only participates in conversation with one specific party was identified by computing legend Paul Vixie: 
Earlier this month, the group of computer scientists passed the logs to Paul Vixie . In the world of DNS experts, there¡¯s no higher authority. Vixie wrote central strands of the DNS code that makes the internet work. After studying the logs, he concluded, ¡°The parties were communicating in a secretive fashion. The operative word is secretive . This is more akin to what criminal syndicates do if they are putting together a project.¡± 
Put differently, the logs suggested that Trump and Alfa had configured something like a digital hotline connecting the two entities, shutting out the rest of the world, and designed to obscure its own existence. Over the summer, the scientists observed the communications trail from a distance. 
Ironically, the academics and others started looking for foreign interference in order to protect both campaigns from outside meddling. It appears as if only one of the two campaigns conspired to that end: 
The computer scientists posited a logical hypothesis, which they set out to rigorously test: If the Russians were worming their way into the DNC, they might very well be attacking other entities central to the presidential campaign, including Donald Trump¡¯s many servers. ¡°We wanted to help defend both campaigns, because we wanted to preserve the integrity of the election,¡± says one of the academics, who works at a university that asked him not to speak with reporters because of the sensitive nature of his work. 
When researchers contacted Alfa Bank for comment, suddenly the Trump Organization shut down their email domain quickly. 
Four days later, the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank resumed communications ¨C and it was the bank who contacted the Republican nominee¡¯s company from Moscow, somehow knowing the new code to interact with the Trump private email server. 
This new information shows that after Trump asked Putin to hack America¡¯s election to prejudice them against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in late July, traffic between the campaign and the Russian bank spiked. 
In the end, this is yet another matter that the FBI will surely have to investigate.. The question is: will they be fair and release the files from their inquiry in the kind of ¡°act of radical transparency¡± that Director James Comey imposed on Hillary?",english,2016-11-01T11:09:03.968+02:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,Experts Just Uncovered The Top Secret Server Trump Uses To Talk To Russia,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-11-01-at-3.08.29-AM.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Republican Donald Trump has denied Russian business ties throughout his entire campaign for President, even after confirmed videos (below) show him bragging adamantly about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
However, Mother Jones just reported that Trump actually maintains a mutually beneficial, direct relationship with Putin, which is why the FBI has been conducting an inquiry into Trump¡¯s campaign management since August. The entire report proves Trump¡¯s Russian connection and was provided to the FBI in August by a ¡°veteran spy¡±¡ª and publicly revealed this afternoon . Here¡¯s the conclusion: 
¡°Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.¡± It maintained that Trump ¡°and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.¡± It claimed that Russian intelligence had ¡°compromised¡± Trump during his visits to Moscow and could ¡°blackmail him.¡± It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on ¡°bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.¡± 
The former intelligence officer says the response from the FBI was ¡°shock and horror.¡± The FBI, after receiving the first memo, did not immediately request additional material, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates. Yet in August, they say, the FBI asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources. The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memos¡ªsome of which referred to members of Trump¡¯s inner circle. After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI. ¡°It¡¯s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,¡± he says. 
¡°This is something of huge significance, way above party politics,¡± the former intelligence officer comments. ¡°I think [Trump¡¯s] own party should be aware of this stuff as well.¡± 
The above bombshell has been confirmed by the federal government. The western spy revealed that the Kremlin began working with Trump up to five years ago. 
Ultimately, this western spy went to the FBI due to the seriousness of the information that he had uncovered. 
A senior US government official not involved in this case but familiar with the former spy tells Mother Jones that he has been a credible source with a proven record of providing reliable, sensitive, and important information to the US government. 
A former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence tells Mother Jones that in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump¡ªand that the FBI requested more information from him. 
In June, the former Western intelligence officer¡ªwho spent almost two decades on Russian intelligence matters and who now works with a US firm that gathers information on Russia for corporate clients¡ªwas assigned the task of researching Trump¡¯s dealings in Russia and elsewhere, according to the former spy and his associates in this American firm. This was for an opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client critical of the celebrity mogul. (Before the former spy was retained, the project¡¯s financing switched to a client allied with Democrats.) ¡°It started off as a fairly general inquiry,¡± says the former spook, who asks not to be identified. But when he dug into Trump, he notes, he came across troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government. According to his sources, he says, ¡°there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.¡± 
This was, the former spy remarks, ¡°an extraordinary situation.¡± He regularly consults with US government agencies on Russian matters, and near the start of July on his own initiative¡ªwithout the permission of the US company that hired him¡ªhe sent a report he had written for that firm to a contact at the FBI, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates, who asked not to be identified. (He declines to identify the FBI contact.) The former spy says he concluded that the information he had collected on Trump was ¡°sufficiently serious¡± to share with the FBI. 
This newest Mother Jones report is chilling news, implicating the Trump campaign in the kind of high level dirty politics that the Republican¡¯s political hero Richard Nixon would¡¯ve found awfully familiar ¨Conly with a bizarre Russian twist. Nixon resigned in disgrace after an investigation found evidence that he¡¯d ordered a break-in to the Democratic National Committee¡¯s offices at the Watergate Hotel seeking information to swing his election. Trump doesn¡¯t look like he will get that opportunity, but might face just as much public scrutiny in the wake of election day due to his Russian ties. 
Donald Trump is the first American politician in history to openly beg Russia for help in an election, let alone in a presidential campaign. The Republican certainly has benefitted from a string of stolen email releases, which has strangely only afflicted Democrats ¡ª and not a single Republican.

It¡¯s official. NBC is now reporting that Donald Trump¡¯s campaign management has fallen under the scrutiny of an FBI inquiry, which is sure to blossom into a formal criminal investigation centered on Trump¡¯s disgraced ex-manager Paul Manafort¡¯s stewardship of the Republican campaign and his close ties to Ukraine. When he departed, Manafort was facing felony charges , and now the FBI¡¯s suspicions have been confirmed by the evidence. 
New York Times f ound Ukrainian documents which outlined $12.7 million in previously unreported payments from a Ukrainian political party to Manafort, precipitating his departure from the campaign. 
The FBI has been conducting a preliminary inquiry into Donald Trump¡¯s former campaign manager Paul Manafort¡¯s foreign business connections, law enforcement and intelligence sources told NBC News Monday . Word of the inquiry, which has not blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation, comes just days after FBI Director James Comey¡¯s disclosure that his agency is examining a new batch of emails connected to an aide to Hillary Clinton. 
Trump has taken a series of pro-Russian positions that experts from both parties say are far outside the mainstream, and inexplicable from a political viewpoint. He continues to cast doubt on Russian involvement in election hacking, for example, despite the intelligence community¡¯s public assessment. 
Just last night, we reported that Nevada Senator Harry Reid issued a statement alleging that the FBI had spoken of, ¡°explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.¡± Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings told CNN this morning that members of Congress in the Democratic minority have actively requested that the FBI look into the various news reports that Trump¡¯s campaign, guided by Manafort, had drifted into Putin¡¯s orbit. 
¡°Any specifics of what the FBI or intelligence agencies may be looking at are not something that the bureau should be discussing publicly.¡± ranking Democratic Congressman on the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff said, ¡°But here, where the director has discussed an investigation involving one candidate, it opens the director up to claims of bias if he doesn¡¯t discuss other potential investigations.¡±

Republican nominee Donald Trump is an admitted serial sexual predator. His own recorded words confirm as much, as do the dozen or so women who have come forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct. His campaign is desperately fighting to put a lid on the growing awareness that Trump will be testifying under oath during a trial in federal court under the accusation of raping a thirteen-year-old girl and a previously undisclosed second girl, who was even younger . 
The case was thrown out in May due to a clerical error, but re-filed in June with two new witnesses ¨C¡°Joan Doe¡± and ¡°Tiffany Doe¡± who both say they worked as ¡°party planners¡± for convicted child rapist and billionaire Jeffery Epstein. Part of that ¡°planning¡± appears to have been procuring girls for the party, as ¡°Joan Doe¡± revealed in her deposition that she convinced victim ¡°Jane Doe¡± to attend four different parties with promises of money and ¡°meeting contacts¡± in the modelling industry ¨C a story that matches the account of another person who would arrange for underage women to attend Trump¡¯s parties. 
At one of these parties, ¡°Jane Doe¡± was forced to perform oral sex on Trump with a twelve-year old named ¡°Maria.¡± At the fourth and final encounter, Tiffany Doe says ¡° I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldn¡¯t ever say anything if she didn¡¯t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed.¡± 
¡°Maria¡± hadn¡¯t been seen since the previous encounter. Trump then forcibly raped ¡°Jane Doe,¡± who was then raped and sodomized again by Jeffery Epstein, who was apparently furious tha t Trump had ta ken her virginity and not him, beating her in his fury . 
Donald Trump told New York magazine in 2002 that ¡°I¡¯ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He¡¯s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it ¡ª Jeffrey enjoys his social life.¡± 
Epstein¡¯s brother, Mark, also testified that ¡°Trump flew on Jeffrey¡¯s private jet at least once and records indicate that Trump called Epstein twice in November of 2004.¡± 
Epstein eventually recieved a slap on the wrist ¨C 13 months in prison and registration as a sex offender ¨C for decades of abuse : 
¡°according to law-enforcement officials and alleged victims, between the years 1998 and 2007¡ªand possibly even earlier¡ªhe ran a particularly vile pyramid scheme that involved paying minors around $200 at a time to perform sexual massages nearly every day and then recruit even younger girls to do the same. (¡°The more you do, the more you are paid,¡± one said.) During these massages, girls as young as 13 told police they were instructed to get undressed. Epstein would masturbate or penetrate them, they said¡ªwith his finger, or a vibrator, or his allegedly egg-shaped penis.¡± 
The details keep coming, and the picture they paint grows darker and more horrifying by they day. How much more evidence does America need? How many more stories need to be told before the word of one rich man is outweighed by literally dozens of contrasting accounts?

Federal Judge John Michael Vazquez set a court appearance for this Thursday for the Democratic National Committee¡¯s emergency legal action to fight Republican minority suppression efforts. 
The DNC filed suit over a generation-old consent decree last week seeking an injunction and extension of the order by eight years, which prevents illegal Republican voter suppression ¡°ballot security¡± measures. 
That lawsuit is looking ever more likely to succeed, resulting in an order barring Republicans across the country from targeting minority voters. The RNC¡¯s response pointedly omitted any defense of the Michigan and Pennsylvania RNC members accused of unlawful ballot security programs, who are the two key players in this courtroom drama that also involves VP candidate Mike Pence and Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. 
The federal judge ordered both Michigan GOP Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDonald ¨C Mitt Romney¡¯s niece ¨C and Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Rob Gleason to submit sworn statements along with documentation of their ballot security programs by 5pm today. 
Last night, Republican lawyers tossed the two high-ranking RNC members under the bus by failing entirely to defend their actions, sworn accounts of which are due at 5pm today. The Democrat¡¯s strongest claims are against the two national RNC members who spoke to the media about ballot security programs. 
The Washington Post wrote about the Pennsylvania GOP¡¯s plans to flood urban Philadelphia with suburban poll watchers from other counties and a legal effort to remove state law restrictions on out of county ballot watchers, while t he Michigan State GOP Chairwoman was quoted in The Detroit Free Press as saying she was directing measures in Michigan to launch a ¡°massive anti-fraud¡± effort. 
Under the 1982 agreement between the parties as it¡¯s been modified through the years, any ¡°ballot security program¡± must be submitted to the court and DNC for ¡°preclearance¡± ten days before being implemented. It seems highly unlikely that the DNC was notified of any of the four major activities the court demanded to be explained. 
The Republican National Committee also has until 5pm today to deliver statements about minority voter suppression made in public, video recorded comments by VP nominee Mike Pence and media reports about the Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway¡¯s statements after the third and final debate. Additionally, the national Republican party has got to deliver to the court any and all agreements between the RNC and the Trump campaign that involve electioneering or polling places to the court as well. 
The Democratic lawyers even submitted fresh evidence to the court that the RNC is involved nationally in poll security operations, which a former federal prosecutor obtained via text message during the normal course of poll watching activities. The RNC denies activity in any and all poll watching venues in their legal filings. 
The Republican National Committee is clearly frustrated by its lengthy tenure under the key voter protection legal agreement, and you can tell from the legal filing that it wants out. However, the Republican party of Trump isn¡¯t playing by the rules, like it¡¯s standard bearer doesn¡¯t play by the rules, and now they¡¯re likely going to be punished.

I will make sure that you and I meet one day while we¡¯re in the courthouse. And I will take you for every penny you still don¡¯t have. And I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know. So I¡¯m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I¡¯m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting. You understand me?¡± 
¡°You write a story that has Mr. Trump¡¯s name in it, with the word ¡®rape,¡¯ and I¡¯m going to mess your life up¡­ for as long as you¡¯re on this frickin¡¯ planet¡­ you¡¯re going to have judgments against you, so much money, you¡¯ll never know how to get out from underneath it.¡¯ 
Which begs the question, why so defensive if there is nothing to hide, Mr. Trump? 
Donald Trump¡¯s followers are some of the lowest, most hateful scum to ever tarnish American soil. Klansmen, neo-Nazis, white supremacists. They send death threats to anyone who dares to speak out against him ¨C if you¡¯re lucky. You could receive horrifying, personalized attacks like a Jewish writer for the National Review did: 
Given the ease with which Trump supporters will bring violence on the innocent , it is no wonder that these women are reluctant to come forward. This is the culture of fear that Donald Trump has created ¨C and one which will consume our whole nation if we somehow let him become President.

Many people have been wondering whether or not a white man known for waving Confederate flags at black teenagers and just murdered two cops is a Trump supporter. 
Grant Rodgers, a journalist for the Des Moines Register , did some investigating and found some pretty undeniable evidence that yes, Michael Greene Scott supported the Republican nominee for President. 
The house is Greene¡¯s last listed address, which he shares with his mother. 
Greene turned himself into earlier today and is in custody after allegedly firing thirty or more shots into a parked patrol car, killing two police officers in Des Moines, Iowa.

The President reiterated his determination to not be seen as ¡°meddling¡± in the case , but rightfully criticized Comey for stirring up undue controversy over pure speculation on emails that were neither sent nor received by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 
¡°Setting aside the particulars of this case, I know that [Hillary Clinton] is somebody who has always looked out for the interests of America and the American people first, and I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations, we don¡¯t operate on innuendo, we don¡¯t operate on incomplete information, we don¡¯t operate on leaks, we operate based on concrete decisions that are made. 
When this was investigated thoroughly the last time, the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was that, you know, she had made some mistakes, but that there wasn¡¯t anything there that was, you know, prosecutable.¡± 
The president hit the nail right on the head. This ¡°investigation¡± is over and done with; for Comey to throw fuel on the fire of right-wing paranoia this close to the election cannot be seen as anything but a partisan effort to derail the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, especially after it became clear that Comey tried to suppress news of the investigation into Republican nominee Donald Trump¡¯s ties to the Russian Federation ¨C a much more serious and potentially seditious allegation.

A federal judge in Nevada just dragged the Trump campaign into court to answer for accusations of using minority voter intimidation tactics alongside the RNC. This case is on similar grounds as the national suit, and accuses the Nevada state GOP of violating the surviving provisions of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, seeking to deprive American citizens of their civil rights, in this case, the right to vote. 
A federal judge Tuesday ordered representatives from the Donald Trump campaign and the Nevada Republican Party to appear at a hearing in his courtroom Wednesday afternoon in a lawsuit filed by Nevada Democrats accusing them of the engaging in voter intimidation tactics. U.S. District Judge Richard Franklin Boulware also ordered the Trump campaign and state party to turn over any training materials they provided to ¡°poll watchers, poll observers, exit pollsters or any other similarly tasked individuals.¡± 
At the hearing, the Trump campaign and the Nevada GOP should be prepared to respond to the motion for a temporary restraining order that the Democrats requested in the lawsuit, the judge¡¯s order said. 
In other new, there was an order issued in the national voter intimidation case against the RNC that we¡¯ve been following. A federal judge just ordered the Republican National Committee to turn over their entire geographic targeting plan for poll watching after Democrats filed a lawsuit last week under a 35-year old binding legal agreement to prevent minority voter suppression by the GOP. 
At a court hearing this morning, top RNC officials were ordered to testify under oath and reveal all knowledge about poll watching or observation programs to be enacted by RNC volunteers. 
Trump¡¯s campaign manager, Republican VP candidate Mike Pence, two GOP state party chairs, and longtime wingnut Trump operative Roger Stone all stand accused of violating the agreement by instituting or speaking about illegal ¡°ballot security programs¡± in recordings and to the media. 
Republicans ¡°ballot security¡± ideas need to be pre-cleared 10 days in advance by Democrats and the federal court according to the 1982 agreement, and nowhere have GOP lawyers asserted that they asked for such clearance to date. Judge John Michael Vazquez ordered : 
ORDERED that Defendant [Republican National Committee] shall also produce to Plaintiff [Democratic National Committee] no later than 5:00 p.m. EST, November 3, 2016, and file on the docket the following: An affidavit or affidavits by a person or persons with personal knowledge setting forth in detail Defendant¡¯s efforts regarding poll watching or poll observation¡¯ in connection with the 2016 Presidential Election. 
Defendant¡¯s efforts shall apply to those efforts by any employee, agent, or servant of Defendant, including volunteers and independent contractors/vendors. The affiant(s) shall be an agent, servant, or employee of Defendant. The affidavit(s) shall set forth all material terms of any such efforts, including any geographic areas which are being targeted for poll watching or poll observation and the reason(s) those areas are being targeted . Any training materials or advice, whether written, electronic, or verbal, provided to poll watchers or poll observers shall also be provided. 
Democrats have requested injunctive relief from the court to stop Republicans from flooding polls in minority areas with ¡°poll watchers¡± seeking to prevent, challenge or intimidate voters from casting their votes, rather than ensuring the rights of voters to make their choices. 
Just yesterday, another long list of court ordered disclosures was made public, and it included the Republican party¡¯s response to the Democrats stiff demands for sanctions and contempt of court against the Republican party¡¯s violators. 
In the GOP¡¯s response they notably failed to defend the Pennsylvania state GOP chair (who is also a member of the RNC and therefore fully bound by the agreement), who disclosed that he was trying to change state law to allow voters from suburban counties around Philadelphia to flood into polling places in the urban areas where there¡¯s a majority of minority voters. 
Oral arguments in the case are happening tomorrow, and it¡¯s expected that the court will issue a decision in the case. 
Oddly, Republicans are facing these numerous lawsuits because they ¡°won¡± a court battle over the 1982 consent decree which prevents them from intimidating minority voters, that forced Democrats to sue for state party activities separately from the national party, even though many of those activities are the same and all of the top state party officials are part of the RNC themselves. 
Now, there are three other states where the Republican state parties are facing legal action by Democrats for ballot security programs, which might violate both the aforementioned Ku Klux Klan Act or the Voting Rights Act or both.",english,2016-11-03T01:08:06.271+02:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,Trump Campaign Was Just Ordered To Appear In Court For Voter Intimidation,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/trumpcourt.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

As it happens Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has written a book other than ¡°The Art Of The Deal¡± and in true Trumponian fashion, it is a fiction novel titled ¡° Trump Tower ¡°that should more likely be classified as smut. 
Trump described the book as ¡° The sexist novel of the decade¡± and was originally billed as, ¡° The debut novel from ¡®New York Times¡¯-bestselling author, international business mogul, television superstar, and New York City icon, Donald J. Trump.¡± 
¡°Trump Tower¡± was a magnificent flop and Trump, staying true to his penchant for not admitting obvious failure, removed his name from the book in its second iteration and gave all credit to ghostwriter Jeffrey Robinson. However, as Trump is now to learn, once something is on the Internet it is on their forever ¡ª even if you are a not-yet-convicted sexually predatory offender with money. Below is the original listing with the U.S. ISBN agency: Jeffrey Robinson¡¯s #TrumpTower has it all. The ultra rich, powerful, and beautiful. It¡¯s your summer must-read http://t.co/lQKvIzzV 
¡ª Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 13, 2012 
In delving into the story, which appears to have been written for those with the reading comprehension of a first grader in mind, it routinely degrades women. The opening chapter speaks of a tenant who is bound and gagged to a bed naked only to be found by one of the tower¡¯s staff: 
There she was, completely naked and gagged, her arms above her head, handcuffed to the top of the bedstead, with her legs tied to the bed and stretched wide apart. 
That sounds icily similar to the rape accusations being levied against Trump, no? The official court documents filed against Trump state : 
Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff¡¯s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. 
The other gems of literary genius included: 
¡°Take off your sweatshirt,¡± he said again. Her hands were trembling. ¡°No.¡± ¡°Yes,¡± he said. ¡°Take off your sweatshirt. She reached for the bottom of her sweatshirt, but all she could do was hold onto it. ¡°No.¡± ¡°Yes.¡± ¡°I can¡¯t.¡± ¡°Yes you can. Do as I tell you. Take off your sweatshirt.¡± She tried to swallow, but her mouth was totally dry. ¡°I can¡¯t¡­¡± ¡°Do it. Take off your sweatshirt. Do as I tell you.¡± She closed her eyes, hesitated, then pulled off her sweatshirt. 
And: 
¡°I¡¯d probably like his mama¡¯s titties, too,¡± and, instead of using his key, he rang the bell. 
On top of the sordid sexual scenarios in Trump¡¯s book, there are disrespectful racial references: 
Come on, you¡¯re a shoo-in.¡± He reminded her, ¡°Two white guys and a great-looking minority girl with perfect boobs? No contest.¡± 
Apparently Trump was too cheap to hire an editor as the book is riddled with grammatical errors such as, ¡°In fact, none of the apartments in the tower was numbered.¡± 
In his quest for attention Trump attempted on numerous occasions to have his clap trap babble transitioned to television. The book had been in the works since the late 90s and according to Bob Frederick, who represents MVP Entertainment, ¡°We hired a writer out of Los Angeles and developed a pilot with Showtime. And Donald was happy with it.¡± 
More than a decade later in 2008 Trump pitched the story to Lifetime which presented its own disgusting irony. The likely soon-to-be-convicted sexual predator wanted his story on a network known for producing shows about sexual predators. 
Trump¡¯s co-author, Mr. Robinson, has refused to comment on the book. However, if one were so inclined they are able to read the first few chapters for free on Amazon¡¯s kindle version , using the preview option. That is all one should read for two reasons. The first is purchasing the book would put money in Trump¡¯s pocket, and the second is ingesting the entire story will likely lead to psychosis, the loss of brain cells, and IQ points.",english,2016-11-03T09:56:20.643+02:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,Trump Wrote A Book About Sexually Assaulting Women And Casual Racism,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/trumptower-1.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Mark Cuban has been vocally outspoken about the 2016 election after learning the dark truth about Republican nominee Donald Trump. Initially, Cuban actually supported Trump¡¯s candidacy as someone independent from politics as usual, but as he (and we all) learned more about the dark past of The Donald¡¯s dirty dealings , sexual predations and more, the Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner threw himself wholeheartedly into the political arena, culminating with front row seats to the last presidential debate. 
Cuban sat down with local radio broadcasters to discuss rumors that his anti-Trump stance might cost him ticket sales for his NBA franchise. Mark Cuban probably, literally dropped the mic after this response: 
¡°You know what, when it¡¯s all said and done, I¡¯d rather lose every penny than have Trump as president because I care more about the future of my family, my children than I do about my pocketbook. And so if it means we play to empty arenas, I¡¯m down with that.¡±

Mark Cuban is a shining example of how any American should approach the political arena, which he does by placing integrity over ideology and the good of the country in his viewpoints above the simple view of his bank account¡¯s short term health. Luckily, Cuban is a franchisee in the NBA, which is far and away America¡¯s most progressive major sports league, which doesn¡¯t guarantee ongoing success, but does mean that the typical NBA fan values tolerance and diversity over racial segregation and hatred.",english,2016-11-03T09:56:20.978+02:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,Mavs Fans Got Mad At Mark Cuban For Bashing Trump.

During the middle of the night, the city of Des Moines in Iowa was rocked with violence as a man opened fire on police officers in ¡°ambush¡± style, killing two. The suspect is a white male, as per police reports, and has just been taken into custody. 
What we do know about this man is that his mind is a whirlwind of hatred and hypocrisy. He was kicked out of a football game in October for waving a Confederate flag at football players kneeling during the National Anthem in protest of police violence against blacks. 
¡°I was offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem. Thousands more whites fought and died for their freedom. However this is not about the Armed forces, they are cop haters.¡± said Greene in a rant tinged with white nationalist themes, three weeks before he would ambush two policemen in their patrol car and killing them both. 
The Trump camp is silent as a man who supports him embarks on an act of anti-government violence that Trump himself has been calling for . The muted response is infuriating, especially for the blacks and Muslims of America who have been demonized by right-wingers for trying to stop racial/ethnic profiling and ask they be given the benefit of the doubt that white Americans get. 
Why does the media refuse to call this what it is ¨C terrorism? Where was Greene radicalized? Why won¡¯t Donald Trump say ¡°radical white terrorism?¡± Is he part of a larger white supremacist terror group? We need to put a stop to white men entering this country until we can figure out what the hell is going on. Sound familiar?

Ohio has become the second state ¨C after Nevada ¨C to order the Trump campaign to appear in court and answer charges of voter intimidation and suppression in urban areas. 
A federal judge ordered Republican nominee Donald Trump, his longtime political advisor Roger Stone and the Ohio Republican Party into court this week to face charges of violating the Voting Rights Act and the remaining provisions of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which makes it illegal to conspire to deprive citizens of their civil rights, specifically voting rights. Cleveland.com reports : 
The order entered Tuesday by U.S. District Judge James Gwin in Cleveland says the defendants¡¯ response must include any objections to an order ¡°limiting voter intimidation¡± or ¡°limiting people at polling locations who are not authorized poll watchers or outside the polling stations.¡± 
The speed in which Gwin ordered the response, while not necessarily signaling how he feels about the case, shows that the judge is taking the accusations of voter intimidation seriously before Nov. 8 Election Day. 
The candidate may use a wink and a nod, but that doesn¡¯t allow anyone to circumvent the federal laws governing elections. The US Constitution places all federal elections under the realm of congressional control, and the Voting Rights Act makes it illegal to intimidate or pressure anyone seeking to exercise their right to vote. 
As the lawsuit indicates, even Ohio Republicans are reporting Trump supporters using illegal intimidation tactics in Cuyahoga County, the home of Cleveland¡¯s large minority population: 
According to Pat McDonald, the Republican Director of the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections, Trump supporters have already visited the county elections board identifying themselves as poll observers, even though they did not appear to be credentialed as poll observers as required under Ohio law. Indeed, Trump¡¯s fearmongering has caused Cuyahoga County election officials to express concerns of instability on Election Day and to raise the prospect of deploying law-enforcement officials to the polls if necessary to address polling place issues. 
Democrats filed suit late Sunday night to enjoin Republicans from efforts which have included fake poll watcher badges and verbal conduct by the Trump campaign and nominee, plus efforts by Roger Stone¡¯s Super PAC to exit-poll minority polling places, when in fact Stone doesn¡¯t run a polling operation and hasn¡¯t during this year¡¯s campaign: 
The lawsuit cites several examples of such comments by Trump made in Ohio, including a statement made at an Aug. 22 rally in Akron. ¡°You¡¯ve got to get everybody to go out and watch, and go out and vote,¡± Trump said at the rally. ¡°And when I say ¡®watch,¡¯ you know what I¡¯m talking about, right?¡± It also references an unnamed senior Trump campaign official who told Bloomberg News that ¡°we have three major voter suppression operations under way.¡± 
It also takes aim at Stone and a group he controls, Stop the Steal Inc., and seeks to stop them from conducting ¡°exit polling¡± in nine cities that historically vote Democrat. These include Cleveland, Philadelphia and Las Vegas. Stone said in an emailed statement that the polls his organizations will conduct will be scientific. ¡°We seek only to determine if the election is honestly and fairly conducted and to provide an evidentiary basis for a challenge to the election if that is not the case,¡± he said in the statement. ¡°I assume the purpose of this bogus lawsuit is to distract from the voter-fraud the Democrats have traditionally engaged in.¡± 
Stone did not provide any evidence to back up his fraud claim. 
Ohio isn¡¯t the only battleground state in the fight against Republican dirty tricks at the polls. Lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona are also being fought over the same issues , but with each local problem, such as the 94 vigilante poll watchers Roger Stone has signed up in Arizona for his Super PAC. 
The Democratic National Committee is also suing its national counterpart, and just received extensive information about the RNC¡¯s poll watching plans and geographic targeting which is still being held under seal by the federal court. A federal judge is hearing that case in Newark, N.J. tomorrow at 10am and a decision is expected sometime later in the day. 
Ironically, the multi-state litigation is happening because the national Republican Party successfully separated state level parties from the 1982 court monitoring agreement , so now the Democratic Party must file new lawsuits in multiple states in addition to the national case. However, two state party chairmen that are also RNC members have become embroiled in the national case, as well as some of the Ohio issues have been cited in the national case against the RNC. 
The Ohio federal court has greatly expedited this case, so expect more news before election day about rulings meant to protect the general public from vigilante ¡°ballot security¡± operations.",english,2016-11-04T02:28:10.538+02:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,Trump and Roger Stone Were Just Ordered To Court For Voter Intimidation Tactics,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/trumpstone.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Yet another one of the obnoxiously ostentatious monuments to Trump¡¯s ego is going under. The Trump International Hotel in Toronto is filing for bankruptcy, a mere four years after it opened. 
The champagne and caviar toned tower will be auctioned off after a Canadian bankruptcy judge placed the building into receivership on Tuesday. 
In a story that is now very familiar to all of us , the $310 million project was beset with lawsuits from the start from angry investors who claim that Trump and his partners lied to them with ¡°wildly overstated projections of Trump Toronto¡¯s performance,¡± telling investors the ¡°worst case¡± scenario for occupancy rates would be 55%, when in fact court documents show it varied between 15% and 45%. POLITICO details just how hard Trump screwed his investors: 
It is clear from affidavits in the fraud cases and the bankruptcy case that the buyers have taken a financial beating. A warehouse supervisor named Sarbjit Singh, who was earning about $55,000 a year, testified that he borrowed money from his father, a retired welder, for the deposit on his hotel unit; he never closed on the deal, but he says he still lost $248,000. Se Na Lee, a homemaker who was married to a mortgage underwriter, borrowed money for her deposit from her parents; she did close, and ended up losing $990,000 through December 2014, she says. 
Trump licensed his name for the project to Talon International, owned by a Russian-born oligarch, Alexander Shnaider. ¡°The whole business model has been overpromise and underdeliver, and it¡¯s Trump¡¯s name on the thing¡± said an insider to POLITICO. 
The hotel has been the site of numerous protests against the racist rabble-rouser, and a city Councillor of Toronto has publicly demanded the Trump name be removed from the building, saying in a statement to the project managers that: 
There are some who may suggest that Canadians should just ignore Mr. Trump, or that he doesn¡¯t matter because he is a political figure in another country. 
However, recent attacks against Muslims in Toronto, and other Canadian cities, show that we are not immune to hateful actions against peaceful people. As well, the Canadian government¡¯s similar internment of Japanese-Canadians is a part of our past that is still very painful for many. 
To have the Trump name displayed so prominently on our skyline signals a tacit acceptance of hateful and divisive views. 
Such is the legacy of Donald Trump, disgraced businessman and divisive race-baiting sexual predator: angry citizens, angry investors, bankruptcy, and a prominent stain where the letters of his name once stood.",english,2016-11-04T02:28:12.616+02:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,A Judge Just Declared Trump¡¯s New Hotel BANKRUPT,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/trumptowerbankrupt.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

Numerous FBI officials, both current and former, say the Bureau is intentionally attempting to influence the presidential election in favor of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by damaging the candidacy of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. 
The interworkings of the FBI have been generously described as ¡°chaotic¡± since Director James Comey declined not to recommend Hillary Clinton face criminal charges over her private email server, and this is because, as one current FBI agent described, ¡°the FBI is Trumpland.¡± 
This is a view shared by numerous other agents , none of which would speak directly on the record for fear of both professional and personal reprisal. 
Comey then turned about-face and wrote a vague letter to Congress to announce the FBI would soon begin the process of combing through new emails which it had recently discovered that were tied to Clinton by way of Anthony Weiner , a disgraced Democratic congressman and failed New York City mayoral candidate who happens to be married to Clinton¡¯s top aid, Huma Abedin. 
The FBI looked at Weiner because of accusations that he had been having illicit sexual conversations with an underage g irl. Comey¡¯s letter was almost immediately leaked by Congressman and self-appointed Clinton inquisitor Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and the dominoes began to fall in Trump¡¯s favor. Clinton¡¯s polling numbers began to sink, and the negativity surrounding the allegations of various sex crimes committed by Trump began to dissipate as the nation¡¯s perpetually wandering attention returned to the ersatz email ¡°controversy¡¯. 
One FBI agent said that Clinton is viewed as ¡°the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel¡± which is why the information about Clinton has been timed to coincide with the election, ¡°they¡¯re pro-Trump.¡± 
However, not all of the information coming out of the FBI is entirely anti-Clinton. Trump¡¯s former campaign manager and former Putinist operative Paul Manafort, is also said to have an active investigation open against him and that the investigation is in its early stages. 
A former FBI official has a different take on the matter and said, ¡°There are lots of people who don¡¯t think Trump is qualified, but also believe Clinton is corrupt. What you hear a lot is that it¡¯s a bad choice, between an incompetent and a corrupt politician.¡± 
The content of the newly discovered emails, if they even exist at all, are unknown as Comey wrote his letter to Congress before the FBI acquired a warrant to read the emails. This is further evidence of the FBI¡¯s bias against Clinton as the FBI exists to investigate facts rather than spreading propagandistic rumor ¡ª particularly weeks before a presidential election which many have said is a clear violation of the Hatch Act which was enacted to prevent individuals like Comey from using the power of their office to engage in partisan political activities. 
Rudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City, hinted towards these actions by the FBI against Clinton two days before they transpired . He said, ¡°I think he¡¯s (Trump) got a surprise or two that you¡¯re going to hear about in the next few days. I mean, I¡¯m talking about some pretty big surprises.¡± Now would Giuliani know the FBI was going to write a vague letter which would shake up the presidential election unless the FBI had already decided to take the action and time the release of the letter specifically to damage Clinton? 
The Director of the FBI is a position that can only be appointed by a sitting president, and the director is given a 10-year term. The concern is due to the FBI¡¯s bias against Clinton, and the likelihood of her victory, it would appear all but impossible that James Comey would be capable of fulfilling his duties. The president has the discretion to unilaterally fire an FBI Director. The Congressional Research Service found ¡°there are no statutory conditions on the President¡¯s authority to remove the FBI director.¡± If Clinton is able to beat back the FBI¡¯s last-minute attempts to influence the election, it is all but assured that she will fire Comey on her first day in the Oval Office.

Republicans are fond of blaming the media for their troubles, but never blaming voters for utterly rejecting their party¡¯s platform of racism, hatred and economic inequality. To some Republican voters, it will even come as a surprise that Donald Trump loses next week¡¯s election, but the signs were all there and here¡¯s an excerpt from just one of the rare Fox News stories that admits it: ¡° ¡®Sleeping Giant¡¯ awake and roaring ¨C early voting shows high Latino turnout ¡°: 
The tens of millions of early votes cast point to strength from Democratic-leaning Latino voters, potentially giving Clinton a significant advantage in Nevada and Colorado. With more than half the votes already cast in those states, Democrats are matching if not exceeding their successful 2012 pace, according to data compiled by The Associated Press. 
Latinos, another group that Democrats have been banking on, are turning out in larger numbers than anticipated, and they very well may be the ones who give the party¡¯s presidential nominee the margin of victory. ¡°We are seeing the trajectory of the election change in some states, but Democrats are also making up ground,¡± said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor and expert in voter turnout. 
They don¡¯t let Sean Hannity or Lou Dobbs on to Fox News Latino, which is probably why it actually publishes some factual stories, unlike Fox News or Fox Business, who just today had to retract an entirely false story about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. 
Meanwhile, Univision exit polling is showing that Latinos have the same high level of regard for Hillary Clinton in Florida that they have for President Barack Obama. This level of support is considered key to the Democratic nominee¡¯s strategy to win the Sunshine State, which would act as a firewall, closing almost all of the Republican nominee¡¯s paths to the presidency. The Miami Herald reports : 
Hillary Clinton has hit a key marker among Florida Hispanics, according to a new poll: She¡¯s reached the level of popularity that helped President Barack Obama win the nation¡¯s largest battleground state in 2012. 
Sixty percent of Florida Latinos favor Clinton, the Univision News poll shows. That¡¯s the same number that voted for Obama four years ago, according to exit polls from that election. 
The polls further indicate that Hillary Clinton will probably get at least 60% of the latino vote in Florida, but there¡¯s 9% of the sample that is still not decided, so it could be much higher by the time election day finishes. 
Politico is reporting that the Democratic nominee¡¯s 30-point lead amongst Latino voters in Florida isn¡¯t just a problem for Trump, but that for the entire GOP it¡¯s a ¡°terrifying¡± prospect. For the wing of the Republican party that likes to win elections, this poll is probably invoking the moment where they see their party¡¯s entire electoral history as the party of Lincoln flash before its eyes, which can only mean that the end of the decadently twisted Grand Old Party is near. 
Republicans wrote an autopsy of their party after their politics of division, hatred and the 47% blew the 2012 election, which declared the GOP dead in the water. Particularly, the report cited the Tea Party¡¯s radical anti-immigration policies, racist dog whistles and the war on women. 
Luckily, that spurred the rank and file GOP voters in 2016 to pick an orange zombie Presidential candidate, a man who has turned off women and latinos like a switch, and added muslims, finished off black people and finally convinced college educated voters to trust that the Democratic party is the only rational political actor that can be trusted. 
Donald Trump¡¯s ¡°safe zone¡±¨C THE Fox News Network ¨C is reporting a massive turnout in the latino communities the Republican candidate so despises. 
Now, there is absolutely no way he can claim that the election is rigged next Tuesday night when all of the major news networks pronounce his campaign dead, and the Republican Party along with it.

As election day draws closer and closer, it becomes even harder to understand or tolerate Donald Trump supporters. It is conceptually difficult for many of us to understand how anyone could support Trump knowing all we know about him. But many people don¡¯t know what we know, so here¡¯s a viral list that every Trump supporter needs to read before they vote on Tuesday, courtesy of some anonymous Facebook poster. 
So You Want Someone To ¡®Tell It Like It Is¡¯? OK, Here You Go. 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin¡¯s puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin¡¯s girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals. 3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade¡¯s cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said ¡° I ¡®sort of hope¡¯ real estate market tanks.¡± Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person. 4. You say you¡¯re patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution¡¯s limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin¡­etc 5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton¡¯s history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can¡¯t ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional. 
8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem? 9. I agree 100% if she¡¯s elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people¡¯s money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home? 11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin¡¯s little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right¡¯s anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country? 12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said ¡°Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,¡± and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary¡¯s reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as ¡°super-predators¡± in 1996? I don¡¯t agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don¡¯t care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.",english,2016-11-05T05:34:14.286+02:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,This Open Letter To Trump Voters Just Told It ¡°Like It Is¡±,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/trumpderp-1.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Famous techno musician Moby tore into Republican nominee Donald Trump today in an op-ed published in RollingStone magazine, tearing into the racist rabble-rouser with unrepentant fury. ¡°I¡¯m tired of being a mealy-mouthed, NPR-listening lefty who has to respect other people¡¯s opinions¡± writes Moby. ¡°Trump is an actual sociopath.¡± 
Distraught at the unrelenting vitriol being hurled at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Moby disparages the naivete with which he feels many voters are approaching the election. 
If you have a 25-year-old who¡¯s a Jill Stein supporter but they were nine when Ralph Nader handed the presidency to George W. Bush, they don¡¯t know better. There are a lot of people who have lived in a relatively benign bubble, like young women who just assume that Roe v. Wade will always be the law of the land. I think that there¡¯s an innocence that is informing a lot of people¡¯s desire not to vote, or to vote for Jill Stein, but it¡¯s because they¡¯ve had eight years of Obama. And I think that that innocence is making some of them naive and delusional. 
He then goes on to detail just why a Donald Trump presidency is enough of a threat for him to be so undiplomatic in his approach. 
I think there is something seriously broken inside him where he¡¯s an actual sociopath and on the spectrum pretty close to being a psychopath. He¡¯s done nothing to indicate that he¡¯s even capable of feeling empathy [for anyone] except for himself. 
[A Trump presidency would be] death by 1,000 Republican cuts. It basically gives the NRA the ability to write gun policy. It gives the coal industry and the oil industry the ability to write energy policy. It¡¯s handing the keys to people who want to advance policy measures that are just ¡ª again, I try and be diplomatic, but they¡¯re trying to advance policy measures to protect their corporate interests or protect their personal interests but to the egregious detriment of our country. 
With Trump, you get a belligerent racist who¡¯s most likely a sociopath [and] definitely a racist and misogynist with no governing experience. And with Hillary, you get an incredibly bright, progressive, strong, experienced legislator. There¡¯s no choice unless you¡¯re ignorant, delusional or racist. 
He¡¯s absolutely right on that point. While the ¡°death by 1,000 Republican cuts¡± is the threat posed by any Republican candidate for the Presidency, the figure of Donald Trump is a threat to our Republic as we know it, and there can be only one choice. 
I¡¯ve given more money to Democrats this cycle than I¡¯ve ever given in an election season. I¡¯ve done phone-banking, tweeted, Facebooked and Instagrammed, probably to my own personal detriment ¡ª the detriment of my friendships [and] certainly the detriment of my professional life ¨C but honestly, the results of this election are more important than most. I¡¯d rather lose fans and have a hand in trying to keep Donald Trump out of the White House than trying to protect a career. A career pales in comparison to the health and wellbeing of our country and our planet. 
What I learned a long time ago is if you¡¯re a public figure and you¡¯re opinionated and outspoken, people will hate you for it ¡ª even if they agree with what you¡¯re saying. But it¡¯s really nice: I¡¯ve been doing this for a long time and at this point I just don¡¯t care. What¡¯s someone gonna do ¡ª not buy my records? It¡¯s 2016, no one buys records anyway.",english,2016-11-05T05:34:14.422+02:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,Moby Just Destroyed Trump In A Passionate Defense Of Hillary,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/moby.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

That¡¯s right. The kids were terrorized at gun point over a Trump yard sign. 
Michael Kubek, 56, of Allen Park, MI, said that he was angry at the children because he believed they had ¡®vandalized¡¯ his Trump sign, although he hadn¡¯t actually seen them do it. The children told the police that they were simply walking to a local park when an unhinged Kubek ¡°pulled out a pistol and ordered them to sit down on a neighbor¡¯s lawn.¡± In any case, it appears that the ¡®vandalism¡¯ consisted in the sign simply being knocked down ¨C perhaps Kubek should take out his anger on the wind ¨C and the children were reportedly ¡°traumatized¡± by the experience. 
When police, who were called to the scene by Kubek¡¯s mother, arrived, they found the children lying on the grass with Kubek ¡°standing over them yelling and cursing.¡± The children said he had pointed a gun at them and a neighbor described Kubek using ¡°very profane language.¡± According to local news channel Fox 2, ¡°the kids said they tried to tell Kubek they did not damage his sign, but it only resulted with Kubek telling them to shut up and continue cursing at them.¡±

Republicans have successfully conducted an entire primary and general election without addressing a single key issue on the campaign trail. Now that we¡¯re just days from the election ending, Donald Trump¡¯s campaign has finally addressed climate change ¨C by planning to cut $100 billion dollars in climate change spending, presumably to pay for the ridiculous tax cuts to the rich he proposes. 
It¡¯s been days since the Trump campaign policy was unveiled, but the mainstream media hasn¡¯t even noticed. Most major media outlets who consider themselves ¡°objective¡± are interested in ¡°FBI has become Trumplandia¡± drama, more than this vitally important policy matter that might actually inform voters. Luckily, Bloomberg noticed and reports : 
Donald Trump says he would save $100 billion over eight years by cutting all federal climate change spending¡ªa sum his campaign says would be achieved by eliminating domestic and international climate programs. 
¡°We¡¯re going to put America first. That includes canceling billions in climate change spending for the United Nations, a number Hillary wants to increase, and instead use that money to provide for American infrastructure including clean water, clean air and safety,¡± the Republican presidential candidate said Oct. 31 at a rally in Warren, Mich. ¡°We¡¯re giving away billions and billions and billions of dollars,¡± he said. The Trump campaign did not give a specific tally to account for the $100 billion total in response to a query from Bloomberg BNA. 
But in an e-mail, the campaign press office said that the figure combined an estimate of what the Obama administration had spent on climate-related programs, the amount of U.S. contributions to an international climate fund that Trump would cancel, and a calculation of what Trump believes would be savings to the economy if Obama¡¯s and Clinton¡¯s climate policies were reversed. The Trump campaign said the $100 billion total included $50 billion, or what it estimated the Obama administration has spent on programs related to climate change. ¡°Eliminating that spending will save similar amounts over the Trump administration,¡± it said. 
Trump and his elected Republican supporters have spent this entire election practicing the art of political distraction by choosing a reality TV clown for President, and it¡¯s worked perfectly on the mainstream media who have ignored actual policy for months, feasting on the high ratings of substantive debates about plagiarism, pussy grabbing and Putin. 
This story is important for any voter who¡¯s not sure what you¡¯re getting between the two parties, or torn between a third-party and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. While a third-party might promise the moon and the stars, letting Republicans take over the Oval Office with Trump guarantees that climate change efforts will be defunded, quickly. 
The first beneficiary of that kind of environmental know nothing-ism would be the Koch Brothers, oil companies and the wealthiest of the wealthy who will get the savings on their tax bills when Trump slashes every form of taxation on the rich to benefit himself and the top 1% of earners. 
Let your undecided voter friends know about this travesty which must be stopped on November 8th.",english,2016-11-05T05:34:17.448+02:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,Trump Just Revealed He¡¯s Going To End ALL Federal Clean Energy Development,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/trumpenvironment.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

In this amusing but alarming musical number, famed songstress Rachel Bloom joins a star-studded crew to pen a parody of ¡°We Are The World¡± as a last-ditch attempt to remind American voters of just what exactly is at stake in this election, pleading with the American people to please, please not vote for Donald Trump. 
Joined by such star-studded names like Zach Reino, Jack Dolgen, Moby, Mayim Bialik, Adam Scott, Adam Pally, Melissa Rauch, Jane Lynch, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Bloom has a simple statement for everyone: ¡°Holy Sh*t, Get Out And Vote.¡±

The AP has uncovered concrete evidence that Melania Trump worked illegally in the United States, before obtaining an H-1B Visa as a fashion model: 
Melania Trump was paid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States worth $20,056 that occurred in the seven weeks before she had legal permission to work in the country, according to detailed accounting ledgers, contracts and related documents from 20 years ago provided to The Associated Press. 
Melania Trump¡¯s immigration status was first questioned in early August after the New York Post released nude photos of the prospective First Lady. 
That led the Washington Post to fact check the story and concluded that the photos were taken the year before she claimed to have arrived in America. The facts are that she definitely worked in the United States before getting her first visa in 1996 : 
Mrs. Trump, who received a green card in March 2001 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006, has always maintained that she arrived in the country legally and never violated the terms of her immigration status. During the presidential campaign, she has cited her story to defend her husband¡¯s hard line on immigration. 
The wife of the GOP presidential nominee, who sometimes worked as a model under just her first name, has said through an attorney that she first came to the U.S. from Slovenia on Aug. 27, 1996, on a B1/B2 visitor visa and then obtained an H-1B work visa on Oct. 18, 1996. 
The documents obtained by the AP show she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between Sept. 10 and Oct. 15, during a time when her visa allowed her generally to be in the U.S. and look for work but not perform paid work in the country. The documents examined by the AP indicate that the modeling assignments would have been outside the bounds of her visa. 
Later reports from the Trump organization about her immigration status appeared to show that under the Republican nominee¡¯s own policies , Melania Trump probably would not be allowed in the country. 
Immigration violations can be re-litigated at any later date, if they are fraud or misrepresentation on any of the documents used to gain entry or US citizenship, although this almost never happens. 
The AP reports that the United States government only seeks to revoke citizenship in the ¡°most egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes.¡± 
However, it¡¯s likely that Melania Trump¡¯s immigration status and her Republican nominee husband¡¯s hypocritical stances towards immigration may be thrust into the maelstrom of the waning days of this year¡¯s presidential campaign. 
The big question is: Using the Trump standard for deportation ¨C which would send his wife home to Slovenia ¨C will the Republican candidate petition to send his wife out of the United States?",english,2016-11-05T05:48:30.221+02:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,AP Just Confirmed Melania Trump Worked Illegally As An Immigrant,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0690.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

The Wall Street Journal has revealed that the National Enquirer paid $150,000 to purchase but never print the story of Republican nominee Donald J. Trump¡¯s affair with 1998 Playmate of the Year Karen J. McDougal. 
The alleged affair happened a decade ago, It will come as a surprise to nobody that Trump and CEO David J. Pecker (yup) of American Media Inc, which owns the National Enquirer , are long time friends. 
To say that the Enquirer has supported the Trump campaign is an understatement; they¡¯ve recently run stories alleging that his rival, religious extremist Sen.

The extreme Christian supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump present themselves as righteous holy rollers doing the work of God, but that is a ruse meant to disguise their true intentions of making women mere sexual pawns and exert patriarchal dominance over them. This fact was aptly pointed out by John Pavlovitz , a minister from Raleigh, North Carolina who published a scathing statement indicting all of the individuals who partake in this behavior. 
Pavlovitz attempted to spare no feelings when he warned women about Trump, his supporters, and how those individuals truly view a woman¡¯s role in society: 
To them, you aren¡¯t separate but equal, as they might claim from the pulpit. You may be made in the image of God, but not in the same way that they are. You are inferior. You are lesser than. You are Adam¡¯s rib meat; baby machines, meal preparers, arm candy, pleasure tools designed by God for men to use as they desire. Some of these men of God will have the guts to actually say this, others will simply prove it to you. They are proving it to you now. Listen to them.¡± Pavlovitz says in their twisted patriarchal world, the men on the Christian Right think all men act like Trump, all men talk this way, all men think this way, but adds, ¡°No, we don¡¯t¡ªbut they do.¡± 
A line was drawn in the proverbial sand by Pavlovitz who harpooned the hypocrisy of Trump¡¯s supporters. Trump claims to respect women, as do those who are in favor of his candidacy. Yet, that does not rationally follow for if it were true, and if these individuals did have respect for women, they¡¯d dump Trump immediately: 
If these professed men of God truly acknowledged your inherent value, they would be fiercely defending you right now, instead of Donald Trump. They would be openly condemning such disregard for the image of God within you, and sharply severing their ties with him¡ªbut many of them they aren¡¯t. They¡¯re making excuses. They¡¯re blaming the victim. They¡¯re doubling down. They¡¯re digging in their manly heels right now. 
The good minister pulled back the curtain to expose the sickening philosophy of these individuals. They care not about women as human beings, but consider them to be mere disposable objects to be used for their own nefarious purposes: 
The real reason they¡¯re doing it, is because to them you aren¡¯t worth defending; not your intelligence or your gifts or your worth. As a result, your consent isn¡¯t really a concern either; you may have noticed that. It¡¯s why, in their minds sexual misconduct almost never occurs, and when it does, it¡¯s because you were dressed too provocatively or sending mixed signals, or because their motives were misinterpreted.They don¡¯t believe you have the right to say or no or to be offended. If anything, they believe you should be flattered. This is the hubris of men who think God made you as an accessory. 
In an act of contrition and humility Pavlovitz apologized for the behavior of despicable men who behave as cowardly dogs. He stopped short of apologizing on the behalf of the men, as if he were their spokesperson: 
As a Christian and a pastor and a man, I¡¯d liked to apologize to you for these men and what you endure from them, but I won¡¯t apologize to you on their behalf because that would mean aligning myself with them and I will not do that. They don¡¯t speak for me. They don¡¯t speak for many of us. They certainly don¡¯t speak for God. 
Minister John Pavlovitz¡¯s statement is worthy of a resounding round of applause. As a man of the cloth he truly embodies the values which he espouses, which is a rare and precious trait in a society full of millions of individuals who support Trump and believe that his word is the gospel. It is truly disheartening and frightening to know that while all citizens in the United States have the same rights, and all votes are equal, that so many would use those votes in a way which is detrimental to the lives of their fellow female citizens.",english,2016-11-06T02:18:22.362+02:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,An Influential Pastor Just Nailed Misogynist Male Christian Trump Supporters,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/pastorguy.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Author George R. R. Martin¡¯s books inspired the hit HBO TV series Game of Thrones , and he¡¯s no stranger to political intrigues. Even the legendary fantasy writer Martin never imagined an American demagogue, who could blithely step on every third rail of American politics and survive in the race until the general election. But the man who wrote television¡¯s most hated character ¨C Joffrey Baratheon ¨C just took to his blog to explain definitively why Donald Trump will never be fit to sit on the Iron Throne be president. 
In my lifetime, there has never been a presidential candidate more unfit to lead this nation. 
You don¡¯t need to like Hillary. You don¡¯t need to listen to what Hillary says about Trump, or what I say about Trump. You just need to listen to Trump. If you can do that, and still consider voting for him¡­ well¡­ 
Martin¡¯s book ¡°Song of Fire and Ice¡± inspired the hit TV series, which is loosely based on the War of The Roses , as the warring clans of Westeros fight for control of the Iron Throne. For much of the series, the throne has been captured by golden haired Joffrey Baratheon, whose endless list of offensive behaviors begins as a callous child, and continues through his disastrous reign. Like the fictional boy-king, Donald Trump loves to sit on fancy, throne-like chairs and using his family¡¯s wealth and influence to play at being king. 
The author Martin described the highly unusual nature of this year¡¯s presidential election by zeroing in on the striking difference between negative advertisements for the two candidates. He shrewdly pointed out that Donald Trump¡¯s attack ads are standard political ad hominem affairs ¨C lots of selective editing and bluster, no substance ¨C while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton doesn¡¯t even create traditional attack ads. 
Martin¡¯s list of the many Clinton attack ads doubles as a fine reason that nobody in their right mind, should choose the Republican nominee for President this upcoming Tuesday, November 8th: 
Hillary does not need to use the sort of hoary attack ads that Trump is using. She only needs to present him as he is, and let his own words condemn them. 
And they do. 
No one has to accuse Trump of anything, he has laid it all out there in public for the world to see. 
Yes, he mocked a disabled reporter. There he is, doing it. 
Yes, he told Billy Bush he liked to kiss women without their consent and grab them by their pussies. There he is, boasting about it. When you¡¯re a star, you can do anything. 
No need to accuse Trump of going into the dressing rooms of Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA pagaents when the contestants were changing so he could see them naked. There¡¯s Trump himself, telling Howard Stern about it. 
Yes, he said women should be punished for having abortions. There he is, telling Chris Matthews. His own words, his own face. 
Yes, he said he wants to ban all Muslims from entering the US. Here, see the clip. 
Yes, he¡¯s in favor of Japan and Saudi Arabia and South Korea having nukes, here¡¯s the clip where he says so. 
And on and on and on and on. The Gold Star family, the bad hombres, Judge Curiel, the Miss Universe contestant¡­ his own speeches, his own tweets, his own words. 
Martin even remarked that for a man whose campaign resembles a nastier version of George Wallace, it is eerily starting to look like his braggadocious claim was correct, when in January, Trump said he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue in New York and get away with it. If there¡¯s any one moment in the Republican¡¯s campaign that could be described as Joffrey-esqe, that was the one, where like the fictional, twisted boy king , Donald Trump reveled openly in a threat to kill senselessly, and kill with impunity. 
The dastardly character Joffrey¡¯s Uncle described him in a way that anyone watching Donald Trump might describe the oddly coiffed Republican candidate, ¡°We¡¯ve had vicious kings, and we¡¯ve had idiot kings, but I don¡¯t think we¡¯ve ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king!¡± 
The same harsh words equally apply to Republican nominee Donald Trump¡¯s disastrous fall as the standard bearer of his failed party, the GOP. 
We agree with George R. R. Martin, all any voter needs to do is listen rationally to the irrational Trump speak, and realize that he¡¯s not Presidential material, and has a personality only fit to be an erratic boy-king, and certainly never to sit in the chair behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.

In an explosive interview, Newt Gingrich became completely unhinged, verbally attacking Fox News' Megyn Kelly for referring to Trump as a sexual predator. Throughout the interview, Newt Gingrich seemed to live in an alternate state of reality. He continued to discount polls that show Trump losing badly. He refused to acknowledge that all the tossup states are moving towards Clinton. 
The interview was already contentious when a couple of words from Megyn Kelly turned it explosive. (Video here .) 
""You want to know why Trump has had a rough time?"" Newt Gingrich asked. 
""If Trump is a sexual predator,"" Megyn Kelly said. ""That is ..."" - Advertisement - 
""He is not a sexual predator,"" Newt Gingrich shouted. 
""That's your opinion,"" Kelly said. ""I am not taking a position on it."" 
""You could not defend that statement,"" an unhinged Gingrich shouted. ""Now I am sick and tired of people like you, using language that's inflammatory, that's not true."" 
""Excuse me Mr. Speaker,"" Kelly interjected. ""You have no idea whether it is true or not. What we know is that at least ..."" 
""Neither do you,"" Gingrich shouted. - Advertisement - 
""That's right,"" Kelly replied. ""And I am not taking a position on it unlike you. So what I said is incorrect?"" 
""Yes you are,"" Gingrich replied. ""When you use the words you took a position. And that is very unfair of you Megyn. I think that is exactly the bias people are upset by."" 
""I think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes, sir,"" Kelly replied. ""What I said is if -- no, no, no, -- let me make my point and then I will give you the floor. What I said is if Trump is a sexual predator, then it is a big story. And what we saw on that tape was Trump himself saying that he likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will. That's what we saw. Then we saw ten women come forward after he denied actually doing it at the debate to say that was untrue. 'He did it to me. He did it to me.' We saw reporters. We saw people who had worked with him; people from Apprentice and so on and so forth. He denies it all, which is his right. We don't know what the truth is. My point to you is, as a media story we don't get to say the ten women are lying. We have to cover that story, sir."" 
Gingrich then went into full spin mode. He attempted to characterize the media as biased for covering more about the growing Trump sexual predator scandal than Clinton speeches to banks, a false equivalency. He then unleashed his anger and abuse again.",english,2016-10-27T09:02:15.884+03:00,opednews.com,US,61423,Newt Gingrich goes berserk when Fox News Megyn Kelly referred to Trump as a sexual predator,0,http://www.opednews.com/populum/cachedimages/s_650_opednews_com_38168_---jpg_38168_20161026-950.gif,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Negative

The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho-analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term ""public relations"" as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions. In 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade -- behavior then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, ""Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!"" Bernays' influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret, he said, was ""engineering the consent"" of people in order to ""control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it."" 
He described this as ""the true ruling power in our society"" and called it an ""invisible government."" Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. Imagine two cities. Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. - Advertisement - 
But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties. In the second city -- in another country nearby -- almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by ""us"" -- by the United States and Britain. They even have a media center that is funded by Britain and America. Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys, condemned for assaulting and bombing the city -- which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city. Confusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad. - Advertisement - What is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today. Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was ""vindicated"" for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell's fabrications. The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, ""What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?""",english,2016-10-27T21:45:38.535+03:00,opednews.com,US,61423,"Inside The Invisible Government: War, Propaganda, Clinton & Trump",0,http://www.opednews.com/populum/cachedimages/s_650_i0_wp_com_72413_Media_Propaganda_by_Trosious.gif,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Negative

Permalink (Page 1 of 2 pages) License DMCA 
I could have named this article ""Damage Control"" -- because it essentially is about that, related to the lobotomizing dilemma of ""lesser evil voting"". 
But let me be clear at the outset. I have already voted for Jill Stein . I had no other choice. I am firm in my conviction that to vote for sociopathic, narcissistic, self-serving, ruthless, guileful corporatists is an unconscionable act and a major crime against my country, irrespective of the convoluted rationalization which might attempt to justify it. 
Now let me offer reasoning that goes beyond my ""morally pure"" posturing. 
The accepted wisdom is that a vote for Jill Stein is a vote for Donald Trump. This analysis purports that anyone voting for Stein would likely be a former Clinton supporter, and such a vote would subtract from Clinton's total. 
Even though Hillary's elitist, warmongering, anti-democratic, demonstrably criminal world view is diametrically the opposite of Jill Stein's, and I can't imagine anyone who's moved by the Green Party's agenda for the briefest moment being fooled by Clinton's phony populism, for argument's sake I'll accept this proposition. 
While I consider both Trump and Clinton to be equally unfit for office, I do not for a moment believe they would be equally ineffective. - Advertisement - 
Hillary has for good reason become the choice of the oligarchs, the MIC, the bankers, the media, the people who actually run the country. She will serve them well. She knows her way around the system -- she's been gaming it most of her adult life -- and has all the right connections. Which is why even many prominent Republicans have joined the feeding frenzy and flocked to her like vultures over fresh kill. 
Hillary will continue her faux-populist bloviating to keep the stinky masses in line, while her closest allies, the rich and powerful, continue to loot the Treasury, hollow out what's left of the U.S. economy, and bankrupt the middle and lower classes. 
Much to the delight of the neocon-infested Department of State, Department of Defense, security agencies, MIC, and media, Hillary will ""get tough"" with Russia and China, press the war on Syria and the rest of the Middle East , promote and spread more chaos, death, and destruction across the globe in pursuit of military conquest, ultimately world empire. It'll be good for business and pumping up the already inflated egos of the exceptionalists. 
On the other hand, Trump will fall flat on his face. His trademark bull-in-a-china-shop approach to making deals has no chance of success in Washington DC. He has no support -- his own party has all but disowned him -- no connections, at least not the political ones necessary for promoting his agenda. Yes, the politicos drank his champagne and ate the food at his extravagant bashes. Who wouldn't? But they don't owe him anything. Nada! Trump's much heralded talents for making great deals will confront hostile Democrats, contemptuous Republicans -- a perhaps long-overdue bipartisanship -- closing ranks to isolate and defeat the outrageous and vulgar outsider who thought he could buy and muscle his way into political power. License DMCA - Advertisement - 
He'll try to build his wall. When Congress gets done with it, it'll be a 200-foot white picket fence in Calexico . He'll attempt rapprochement with Russia. That will be sabotaged with a false flag attack, maybe dressing some disgruntled maquiladora workers as Russian infantry men and mounting an invasion on the U.S. -- probably in Calexico -- or by John McCain threatening to fall on a grenade or blow his brains out in the Senate chambers if America doesn't immediately nuke Moscow . 
Despite his self-proclaimed success in the business world, Trump simply does not know the rules of the game in Washington DC. Unless he ""fires"" everyone -- declaring martial law and sending all members of the legislature to a FEMA labor camp in Montana -- he will either be the most ineffective president in history or be impeached. Maybe both! 
In a phrase, Donald Trump as president will do 'less damage'. 
Anyone who has read my recent writings knows that my greatest concern about a Hillary Clinton presidency is her truculent foreign policy . A decade ago, I might have believed that she was misguided. Now I realize -- as quite a number of others do -- that she is completely insane. She's become drunk on power, poisoned by surrounding herself with neocons and warmongering humanitarians , possessed by visions of herself as the Warrior Queen.",english,2016-10-28T23:20:53.521+03:00,opednews.com,US,61423,"Why Donald Trump is not as horrible as Hillary Clinton "" and why you should vote for Jill Stein.",0,http://www.opednews.com/populum/cachedimages/s_650_jdrachel_com_66223_Hillary-Clintons-Syria-1024x640.gif,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Negative

""China installed 26 gigawatts (Gw) of renewable electric generation in the last two years,"" said Colleen Regan, Head of North American Environmental Markets and Cross-sector Research, Bloomberg New Energy Finance. She was presenting at Colorado State University's 21 st Century Energy Transition Symposium. 
Afterword, she confirmed that China installed 20 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in the first 6 months of 2016, dwarfing the 4.3 Gw California installed in all of 2014. 
Regan's information demonstrates how rapidly renewable energy can overtake fossil fuel. Twenty Gw of capacity equals roughly 40, 500 megawatt coal-fired generating stations. It's 8 times more than the 2.5 Gw of generating capacity at Colstrip, Montana's mammoth mine-mouth coal-fired complex. 
To reduce human-caused climate change, Regan forecasts China will meet its 5 year goals of installing 26 Gw of wind and solar generation each year by 2020. By August 2016 China had cut 150 million metric tons of coal capacity, 60 percent of its annual target. 
This demolishes assumptions that increased coal sales to China will prop up bankrupt US coal companies, and dwindling coal tax and royalty revenues in coal producing states. China has moved away from the coal generating frenzy. Its cities have pollution levels 8 times higher than the maximums which trigger alarm in the US. And it can no longer afford to use 20% of its water to cool power plants. Horrible pollution day at the Great Wall License DMCA 
Hence, Chinese coal use dropped 2% in 2014 and 3% in 2015. That helped cause ""1,000 of China's 11,000 coal mines to close,"" according to symposium presenter, Jennifer Turner, Director of the China Environment Forum at the Woodrow Wilson Center. There are ""now 1.3 million unemployed Chinese coal miners,"" she said. Chinese are preoccupied with finding them jobs rather than importing coal to help keep Montana's 1900 coal miners employed. Consequently, rational investors who are cognizant of this reality should be less optimistic about developing coal export terminals on our west coast. 
What about the 1.3 to 1.5 billion people still without electricity? Won't they want to use cheap coal-fire electricity? They would if it were cheaper. But it's not. So they are skipping fossil fuel technology--just like they skipped landline telephones--and are moving to renewable electric generation, much of it coming from distributed micro grids and battery storage. - Advertisement - 
Confirmation that renewables are often cheaper came from Symposium panelist Cathy Woollums, Sr. Vice President, Environmental & Chief Environmental Counsel for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Energy. She said, ""MidAmerican Energy received Iowa Utilities Board approval to install 1000, 2 Megawatt Vestas wind turbines"" by 2019. It will ensure that Iowa--which now gets 35% of its electricity from the wind--will be running on 85% clean electrons by 2019, far ahead of Colorado's 30% and Montana's 15%. 
Ms. Woollums said, ""To do the 2 gigawatt project, MidAmerican did not ask to increase electricity rates"" for the 752,000 electric customers in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and South Dakota. She also said Mid-America was not planning to build natural gas facilities to integrate the wind into its system. The project--which rivals the capacity of Colstrip's four largest coal-fired facilities--will generate more than $1.2 billion in landowner easement and property tax payments over the next 40 years. 
Thus, Montana and other coal-state businesses will have a tougher time competing in surrounding states whose utilities are incorporating more no-fuel-cost electricity (i.e., renewables) into their electricity generation mix. 
Mid-America has a 100% renewable energy vision. At least 17 US cities have committed to work toward 100% too, including: Fort Collins, Boulder, and Aspen, Colorado; Rochester, Minnesota; Greenberg, Kansas; and San Francisco, San Diego, and Santa Barbara, California. Palo Alto, California, and Burlington, Vermont are already there. 
Xcel Energy will close two Minnesota coal-fired plants by 2026. Xcel will add at least 1 Gw of cost-effective wind turbines by 2019, and 0.65 Gw of community solar gardens or other cost-effective solar installations by 2021. So, as Montana's neighbors install more green electricity, it'll be less able to export dirty electrons unless exports meet green energy requirements. - Advertisement - 
2015 produced $349 billion in clean energy investment. Some believe that's a ""war on coal"" that Trump and some Republicans can stop. Others know they'll just ""make electricity more expensive again.""",english,2016-10-28T23:21:00.876+03:00,opednews.com,US,61423,The Clean Energy Market Trumps The War On Coal,0,https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8252/8563665417_5a697ca0bf_q.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Neutral

I woke up yesterday (Thursday) to a small but somewhat encouraging snippet on page 19 of my local (German) paper headlined ""Trump: Clinton Risking World War,"" referring to Trump's remarks on Tuesday in a Reuters interview that was headlined ""Trump says Clinton policy on Syria would lead to World War Three."" 
The five-sentence German article ended with this: ""Critics noted that such [no-fly zones as proposed by Clinton] might have to be enforced militarily."" This was apparently (back-translating from the German) a translation of ""Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets"" (Reuters). 
The Reuters article goes on to say: ""Clinton's campaign dismissed the criticism, noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts have denounced Trump as unfit to be commander-in-chief.""""'Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria,' Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said in a statement."" 
The New York Times and other mainstream outlets reported similarly. I suppose this is considered ""balanced"" coverage -- as if what Lehrich or ""Clinton's campaign"" said was a substantive response to what Trump has finally said clearly and should be obvious. To their credit, the BBC did add (at the end of a 21-sentence article) that Trump ""echoes concerns raised last month at a congressional hearing by the highest-ranking military officer in the US armed forces."" 
""Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford told lawmakers a 'no-fly zone' in Syria could spell war with Russia. 'Right now, senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,' Gen. Dunford told the Senate Arms Services Committee."" - Advertisement - 
At this point, just days before the election, it is probably too late, but it would be Trump's last opportunity to appear statesmanlike, and also save the planet from the catastrophic military adventurism that Clinton seems bound to embark on if she becomes commander-in-chief. At the least it would be a chance to ratchet up popular protest against the warmongering that has driven virtually all U.S. foreign policy since WWII, and is now taking us (and by ""us"" I mean the world) directly toward the precipice of WWIII. 
""Stop demonizing Russia; work with them, not against them."" This is the message that needs to be shouted from the rooftops, and surely Trump has access to experts like Stephen Cohen, Ray McGovern, Robert Parry and others who can help him do so. He should be able to easily ""trump"" the empty arguments of the bellicose Russia-bashers, even if the latter are aligned across party lines against him -- and against us, since the war they are pushing for will be global. How stupid does one have to be to propose ""no-fly zones"" when the highest military officer in the country says it would result in war with Russia? How stupid does one have to be to believe that Putin is ""Hitler,"" that Russia shot down MH17 and is guilty of ""aggression"" on the eastern European borders, in Ukraine, and in Syria, without ever questioning the ""evidence"" for any of these assertions, much less the equally problematic role the U.S. has played in every case? Yet this is the mainstream narrative, repeated uniformly and relentlessly at every turn. 
Trump is obviously not the best candidate in this race (Jill Stein is), but he is right on this most important issue of relations with Russia, which should have been the No. 1 issue from the beginning. So there is still a slight chance that Trump (and Stein also!) can at least go down with a (non-nuclear!) bang, not a whimper -- by giving peace, and reason, a chance. We should all hope that happens. - Advertisement -",english,2016-10-28T23:21:04.354+03:00,opednews.com,US,61423,Trump (finally) Plays Antiwar Card (a little),0,https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5495/9655418458_2e77c16b43.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Negative

He has already declared that he will recognize the results -- but only if he wins. 
That sounds like a joke. But it is far from being a joke. 
Trump has already announced that the election is rigged. The dead are voting (and all the dead vote for Hillary Clinton). The polling station committees are corrupt. The polling machines forge the results. 
No, that is not a joke. Not at all. - Advertisement - 
THIS IS not a joke, because Trump represents tens of millions of Americans, who belong to the lower strata of the white population, which the white elite used to call ""white trash."" In more polite language they are called ""blue collar workers,"" meaning manual workers, unlike the ""white collar workers"" who occupy the offices. 
If the tens of millions of blue collar voters refuse to recognize the election results, American democracy will be in danger. The United States may become a banana republic, like some of its southern neighbors, which have never enjoyed a stable democracy. 
This problem exists in all modern nation-states with a sizable national minority. The lowest strata of the ruling people hates the minority. Members of the minority push them out of the lower jobs. And more importantly: the lower strata of the ruling majority have nothing to be proud of except for their belonging to the ruling people. 
The German unemployed voted for Adolf Hitler, who promoted them to the ""Herrenvolk"" (master people) and the Aryan race. They gave him power, and Germany was razed to the ground. 
THE ONE and only Winston Churchill famously said that democracy is a bad system, but that all the other systems tried were worse. - Advertisement - 
As far as democracy is concerned, the United States was a model for the world. Already in its early days it attracted freedom-lovers everywhere. Almost 200 years ago, the French thinker, Alexis de Tocqueville, wrote a glowing report about the ""Democratie en Amerique."" 
My generation grew up in admiration of American democracy. We saw European democracy breaking down and sinking into the morass of fascism. We admired this young America, which saved Europe in two world wars, out of sheer idealism. The democratic America vanquished German Nazism and Japanese militarism, and later Soviet Bolshevism. 
Our childish attitude gave way to a more mature view. We learned about the genocide of the native Americans and about slavery. We saw how America is seized from time to time by an attack of craziness, such as the witch hunt of Salem and the era of Joe McCarthy, who discovered a Communist under every bed. 
But we also saw Martin Luther King, we saw the first black President, and now we are probably about to see the first female President. All because of this miracle: American democracy.",english,2016-10-28T23:40:18.658+03:00,opednews.com,US,61423,The Israeli Trumpess,0,http://www.opednews.com/populum/cachedimages/s_650_i_ytimg_com_2267_Er9sjBsi6tA_mqdefault.gif,0,0,0,0,0,bs,Neutral
